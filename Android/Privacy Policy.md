Privacy Policy
==============

Your privacy matters to us. Delve into our Privacy Policy to understand how we handle and protect your personal information. Discover our commitment to data security, transparency, and your rights, ensuring a trusted and confidential experience throughout your interactions with our platform.

_This policy was last updated on January 16, 2022._

At Android වැඩකාරයෝ (Android Wedakarayo), we want you to enjoy and benefit from our websites and online services secure in the knowledge that we have implemented fair information practices designed to protect your privacy. Our privacy policy is applicable to Android වැඩකාරයෝ, and Android වැඩකාරයෝ’s affiliates and subsidiaries whose websites, mobile applications, and other online services are directly linked (the “Sites”).

The privacy policy describes the kinds of information we may gather during your visit to these Sites, how we use your information when we might disclose your personally identifiable information, and how you can manage your information.

This privacy policy does not apply to Sites maintained by other companies or organizations to which we may link or who may link to us. We are not responsible for the actions and privacy policies of third-party websites.

****By visiting our Sites, you are accepting the practices described in our privacy policy, including our use of cookies and similar online tools. If you do not agree to the terms of this privacy policy, please do not use the Sites.****

We reserve the right to modify or amend the terms of our privacy policy from time to time without notice. Your continued use of our Sites following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes. If we intend to apply the modifications or amendments to this privacy policy retroactively or to personally identifiable information already in our possession, we will provide you with notice of the modifications or amendments and seek your consent for such use.

What Information Is Collected?
------------------------------

We collect two basic types of information from you in conjunction with your use of the Sites: non-personally identifiable information and personally identifiable information. Non-personally identifiable information does not individually identify you, but it may include tracking and usage information about your general location, demographics, use of the Sites, and the Internet. Personally, identifiable information is any information that can individually identify you and includes your name, address, phone number, and email address, or non-personally identifiable information that has been linked to such personally identifiable information.

### Personally Identifiable Information

As a general matter, you can browse the Sites without submitting your personally identifiable information to us. However, there are a number of circumstances in which you may supply us with your personally identifiable information, including when you subscribe to our publications, newsletters, and other content; register for a Site or any part thereof; complete a poll or participate in market research; enter a contest; upload content; or when you seek employment at Android වැඩකාරයෝ.

### Non-Personally Identifiable Information

When you interact with the Sites, we may collect certain information that does not identify you individually (“non-personally identifiable information” or “non-PII”), such as demographic data; information about your computer, mobile device, or other devices that you use to access the Sites, including IP address, general location information, unique device identifiers, browser type, browser language, and other transactional information.

We may also collect information about your use of the Sites, including your search terms and search results, and additional “traffic data” such as time of access, date of access, software crash reports, session identification number, access times, and referring website addresses. Our servers may automatically keep an activity log of your use of our Sites. In addition to non-identifiable individual information, we may collect aggregate data regarding the use of the Sites.

### Collection of Personally Identifiable Information From or Through Social Media Sites

In addition, when you interact with any Android වැඩකාරයෝ property page or account on a social media platform, such as Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, or LinkedIn, we may collect the personally identifiable information that you make available to us on that page or account including your social media account ID. However, we will comply with the privacy policies of the corresponding social media platform and we will only collect and store such personally identifiable information that we are permitted to collect by those social media platforms. If you choose to link or login to your Android වැඩකාරයෝ account with or through a social networking service, Android වැඩකාරයෝ and that service may share certain information about you and your activities. With your consent, we also may share information about your activities, including what you view on the Sites, with that social network’s users.

### Collection of Your Source IP Address/Location Information

We collect and store your device’s source IP address which may disclose the general location of your device at the time you access the Sites. Advertisements and certain content may be directed to you as a result of this data.

****Information From Other Sources:**** _We may supplement the information we collect with information from third parties or collect offline and add it to your account information. This information may include but is not limited to, demographic information, additional contact information, group affiliations, occupational information, and educational background._

### How Do We Use Your Information?

We also may use or combine information that we collect offline or we collect or receive from third-party sources for many reasons, including to enhance, expand, and check the accuracy of our records.

How Do the Sites Use Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Like many websites, we use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to record your preferences, track the use of our Websites and your exposure to our online advertisements. We may also use these technologies to monitor traffic, improve the Sites and make it easier and/or relevant for your use.

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but, if you prefer, you can usually modify your browser setting to disable or reject cookies. If you delete your cookies or if you set your web browser to decline cookies, some features of the Sites may not work or may not work as designed.

We also use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”), on our Websites. Google Analytics uses cookies or other tracking technologies to help us analyze how users interact with and use the Websites, compile reports on the Websites’ activity, and provide other services related to Websites' activity and usage.

The technologies used by Google may collect information such as your IP address, time of visit, whether you are a return visitor, and any referring website. The Websites do not use Google Analytics to gather the information that personally identifies you.

The information generated by Google Analytics will be transmitted to and stored by Google and will be subject to Google’s privacy policies.

We may partner with third-party advertising companies to better provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. These third-party advertisers may use cookies alone or in conjunction with web beacons or other tracking technologies to collect information about you when you use the Sites. They may collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services. They may use this information to provide you with interest-based advertising or other targeted content.

These online advertising partners do not have access to or use your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, or other personally identifiable information from us, without your consent. They may, however, use persistent identifiers to anonymously track your Internet usage across other websites in their networks beyond these Sites. While we restrict their further use of such information, such third parties may, with sufficient data from other sources, be able to personally identify you, unknown to us.

Third-party ad serving companies and other unaffiliated advertisers also display advertisements on our site. As part of their service, they may place a separate cookie on your computer or utilize other data collection and tracking technologies, to collect information such as your IP address, browser type, the server your computer is logged onto, the area code, and zip code associated with your server, and whether you responded to a particular advertisement. We do not control these third parties tracking technologies, how they may be used, or the information they may collect and we are not responsible for the privacy policies or the content of those third parties. Please visit the sites of those businesses at the links above to review their privacy policies. We may add or change the list of third-party ad servers from time to time and we encourage you to check this section for changes. ****You can learn more about online advertising at [www.aboutads.info/consumers](http://www.aboutads.info/consumers).****

Many of the third-party advertisers that place tracking tools on our Websites are members of programs that offer you additional choices regarding the collection and use of your information. You can learn more about the options available to limit these third parties’ collection and use of your information by visiting the websites for the Network Advertising Initiative and the Digital Advertising Alliance, as well as the web pages for Facebook’s ad preferences tool and privacy policy.

Similarly, you can learn about your options to opt out of mobile app tracking by certain advertising networks through your device settings. For more information about how to change these settings for Apple, Android, or Windows devices, see:

****Apple:**** [http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4228](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4228)

****Android:**** [http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/](https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/)

****Windows:**** [http://choice.microsoft.com/en-US/opt-out](http://choice.microsoft.com/en-US/opt-out)

Please note that opting out of advertising networks services does not mean that you will not receive advertising while using our Websites or on other websites, nor will it prevent the receipt of interest-based advertising from third parties that do not participate in these programs. It will, however, exclude you from interest-based advertising conducted through participating networks, as provided by their policies and choice mechanisms.

Your browser or device may include “Do Not Track” functionality. Because a “Do Not Track” compliance protocol has not yet been finalized, Android වැඩකාරයෝ’s information collection and disclosure practices, and the choices that we provide to customers, will continue to operate as described in this privacy policy, whether or not a Do Not Track signal is received.

### What Are Your Choices?

We believe you should have choices about the collection, use, and sharing of your information. Although you cannot opt out of all data collection when you visit our sites, you can limit the collection, use, and sharing of your personally identifiable information. For information regarding your choices related to interest-based advertising, please see the “How to Do the Sites Use Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies?” section above.

### Collection of personally identifiable information

All personally identifiable information is provided on a voluntary basis. If you do not want Android වැඩකාරයෝ to collect such information, you should not submit it to the Sites. However, doing so will restrict your ability to access some content and use some of the functionality of the sites.

Other Important Information

### How Your Information Is Secured

We take reasonable security measures to protect your information, including the use of physical, technical, and administrative controls. Please understand, however, that while we try our best to safeguard your personally identifiable information once we receive it, no transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. You need to help protect the privacy of your own information.

You are responsible for the security of your information when using unencrypted, open access, or otherwise unsecured networks.

The time period for which we keep information varies according to the purpose for which it is used. In some cases, there are legal requirements to keep data for a minimum period. Unless there is a specific legal requirement for us to keep the information, we will retain it for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the data was collected or for which it is to be further processed.

### Contests, Giveaways, or Games

When we run a contest or giveaway or game relating to our Sites, it will be accompanied by a set of rules.

In conjunction with your entry in such a contest or giveaway, personally identifiable information will be collected only if you voluntarily submit it.
