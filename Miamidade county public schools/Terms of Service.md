7540.02 - **DISTRICT WEB CONTENT, SERVICES, AND APPS**

Web content, services, and apps created by employees and students of the District may be published on the World Wide Web and/or presented for public consumption on web-enabled devices. The creation of web content, services, and apps by students must be done under the supervision of an instructional staff member and must reflect the professional image of the District, its employees, and students. All content must be consistent with the School Board's mission statement and is subject to prior approval of the Superintendent.

Apps/Web services are software (i.e., computer programs) that support the interaction of personal communication devices over a network, or client-server applications in which the user interface runs in a web browser. Apps/Web services are used to communicate/transfer information/data that allow students to perform actions/tasks that assist them in attaining educational achievement goals/objectives, enable staff to monitor and assess their students’ progress, and allow staff to perform other tasks related to their employment. Apps/Web services also are used to facilitate communication to, from, and among and between staff, students, and parents.

The purpose of such web sites, services, and apps is to educate, inform, and communicate. The following criteria should be used:

1. **Educate**  
     
    
    Content provided should be suitable for and usable by students and teachers to support the curriculum and the Board's objectives as listed in the Board's strategic plan.
    
2. **Inform**  
     
    
    Content may inform the community about the school, teachers, students, or departments, including information about curriculum, events, class projects, student activities, and departmental policies.
    
3. **Communicate**  
      
    Content may communicate information about the plans, policies, and operations of the District to members of the public and other persons who may be affected by District matters.
    

The information contained within web content, services, and apps should reflect and support the Board's mission statement, educational philosophy, and the school improvement process.

When the content includes a photograph or information relating to a student, the Board will follow Policy 8330.

All links included on the pages must also meet the above criteria and comply with State and Federal law (e.g. copyright laws, Children's Internet Protection Act).

Under no circumstances is web content to be used for lobbying for candidates for public office, or to provide financial gains for any individual, except as the District authorizes. Web content linked from or hosted on the District's website also may not: (1) include statements or other items that support or oppose a candidate for public office, the investigation, prosecution or recall of a public official, or passage of a tax levy or bond issue; (2) link to a web site of another organization if the other web site includes such a message; or (3) communicate information that supports or opposes any labor organization or any action by, on behalf of, or against any labor organizations. In addition, before any statement that supports a tax referendum proposed by the District is posted on the District website, or on any web pages linked to the District website, the Board shall adopt a resolution at a public meeting declaring that such statement serves a public purpose.

Web content, services, and apps should reflect an understanding that both internal and external audiences will be viewing the information.

School websites must be located on Board-affiliated servers.

The Superintendent shall prepare procedures defining the standards permissible for use.

The Board retains all proprietary rights related to the design of websites and/or pages that are hosted on the Board's servers, along with other web content, absent written agreement to the contrary.

Students who want their class work to be displayed on the school's website (or via other web-based technologies) must have written parent permission and expressly license its display without cost to the Board.

Prior written parental permission is necessary for a student to be identified by name on the school's website, services, or apps.

Effective 7/1/11

Revised 3/15/17
