### Terms of service

Last update: 10/13/2023

Please read these terms of service (“terms”, “terms of service”, “User Terms”) carefully before using the Structural platform operated by Structural, an Augeo company (“us”, “we”, “our”).

### Conditions of Use

An organization or other third party that we refer to in these User Terms as “Customer” has invited you to a Structural tenant. If you are joining one of your employer’s tenants, for example, Customer is your employer. If you are joining a tenant for a specific organization, that organization is our Customer and they are authorizing you to join their instance.

### Privacy Policy

Before you continue using our website we advise you to read our privacy policy ([https://www.augeomarketing.com/structural/privacy-policy](https://www.structural.com/structural/privacy-policy)) regarding our user data collection. It will help you better understand our practices.

### Copyright

Content published on this website (digital downloads, images, texts, graphics, logos) is the property of Customer and/or its content creators and protected by international copyright laws.

### Communications

Except as otherwise set forth herein, all notices under the User Terms will be by email, although we may instead choose to provide notice to Authorized Users through the Services (e.g., a mobile notification). Notices to Structural, an Augeo company should be sent to [support@structural.com](mailto:support@structural.com). A notice will be deemed to have been duly given (a) the day after it is sent, in the case of a notice sent through email; and (b) the same day, in the case of a notice sent through the Services. Notices under the Contract will be delivered solely to Customer in accordance with the terms of that agreement.

### Applicable Law

Structural is a workplace tool intended for use by businesses and organizations and not for consumer purposes. To the maximum extent permitted by law, you hereby acknowledge and agree that consumer laws do not apply. If however any consumer laws (e.g., in Australia, the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth)) do apply and cannot otherwise be lawfully excluded, nothing in these User Terms will restrict, exclude or modify any statutory warranties, guarantees, rights or remedies you have, and our liability is limited (at our option) to the replacement, repair or resupply of the Services or the pro-rata refund to Customer of pre-paid fees for your subscription covering the remainder of the term.

### Disputes

These User Terms remain effective until Customer’s subscription for you expires or terminates, or your access to the Services has been terminated by Customer or us. Please contact Customer if you at any time or for any reason wish to terminate your account, including due to a disagreement with any updates to these User Terms.

### License and Site Access

AS BETWEEN US AND CUSTOMER, YOU AGREE THAT IT IS SOLELY CUSTOMER’S RESPONSIBILITY TO (A) INFORM YOU AND ANY AUTHORIZED USERS OF ANY RELEVANT CUSTOMER POLICIES AND PRACTICES AND ANY SETTINGS THAT MAY IMPACT THE PROCESSING OF CUSTOMER DATA; (B) OBTAIN ANY RIGHTS, PERMISSIONS OR CONSENTS FROM YOU AND ANY AUTHORIZED USERS THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR THE LAWFUL USE OF CUSTOMER DATA AND THE OPERATION OF THE SERVICES; (C) ENSURE THAT THE TRANSFER AND PROCESSING OF CUSTOMER DATA UNDER THE CONTRACT IS LAWFUL; AND (D) RESPOND TO AND RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE WITH YOU AND ANY AUTHORIZED USER RELATING TO OR BASED ON CUSTOMER DATA, THE SERVICES OR CUSTOMER’S FAILURE TO FULFILL THESE OBLIGATIONS. STRUCTURAL MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, TO YOU RELATING TO THE SERVICES, WHICH ARE PROVIDED TO YOU ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS.

### Severability

The User Terms will be enforced to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. If any provision of the User Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, the provision will be modified by the court and interpreted so as best to accomplish the objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the remaining provisions of the User Terms will remain in effect.

### How To Contact Us

If you have questions or comments about these Terms of Service, please contact us online at [support@structural.com](mailto:support@structural.com) or by physical mail at:

Structural, an Augeo company  
Attn: Terms of Service Issues
