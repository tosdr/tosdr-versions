To the extent Internet domain names or IP addresses may identify you, and are necessary to the use of our Web Services, your continued use of our Web Services indicates your receipt of this notice of our use and collection of that information to the extent necessary for our provision of the Web Services to you or as otherwise set out in this policy.

2. Be courteous. You may not make threats or incite anyone else to violence or hatred. It is also prohibited to deliberately disturb any discussion with repetitive messages, unfounded messages or spamming.
3. Discuss but do not attack. In an open discussion where there are many different opinions, people often disagree. Knowledge encourages lively discussions and debates, however personal attacks are a breach of these Terms of Use.

By using the Web Services you agree that Knowledge is not and may not be held liable for the accuracy, legality or the compliance with intellectual property laws or with the conditions of use of any materials provided by its users.

### Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, under no circumstances, including, but not limited to, negligence, shall Knowledge be liable for any loss of use, loss of data, loss of opportunity, loss of income or profit, loss of or damage to property, or for any damages of any kind or character (including without limitation any compensatory, incidental, direct, indirect, special, punitive, or consequential damages), arising out of or in any way connected with the use of, or the delay in use or inability to use, the Web Services, contents of any Web Service, or any website or contents with which it is linked, even if Knowledge has been advised of the possibility of such damages or losses. If you are dissatisfied with any portion of the Web Services, or any of these Terms of Use, your sole and exclusive remedy is to discontinue using the Web Services. If Knowledge or any of its third party providers are found liable in any connection with a claim arising out of or related to using or accessing the Web Services, the aggregate liability to you for all damages, losses and causes of action, howsoever arising, shall not exceed the amount paid by you, if any, for accessing the Web Services. This limitation of liability shall survive the termination of these Terms of Use.

You specifically acknowledge that Knowledge will not be liable for content or the defamatory, offensive or illegal conduct of any third party and that the risk of harm or damage from the foregoing rests entirely with you.

The Web Services are solely directed to individuals located in Canada. Knowledge makes no representation that any Web Service is appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who access or use the Web Services from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are responsible for compliance with local law.

### Indemnity and Release

By using the Web Services you agree to indemnify Knowledge and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, volunteers and employees and hold them harmless from any and all loss, liability, damages, claims and expenses, including legal fees, arising from your violation of these Terms of Use, your use of the Web Services, or your breach or alleged breach of the copyright, trade-mark, proprietary or other rights of third parties. By accessing the Web Services you are agreeing to release Knowledge and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, volunteers and employees from any and all claims, demands, debts, obligations, damages (actual or consequential), costs and expenses of any kind or nature whatsoever, whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, that you may have against them arising out of or in any way related to your use of the Web Services or the products or services offered at or associated with the Web Services. You agree to waive all laws that may limit the efficacy of such release.

### Termination and Modification

You agree that Knowledge, in its sole and absolute discretion, may terminate your password, account registration or use of any Web Services, and remove and discard any materials submitted by you through the Web Services, for any reason, including without limitation, if Knowledge believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these Terms of Use. Knowledge reserves the right to remove any Content submitted by you to any Web Service without prior notice. Knowledge may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue providing the Web Services, or any part thereof, with or without notice. You agree that any termination of your access to the Web Services under any provision of these Terms of Use may be effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that Knowledge may immediately de-activate or delete your account and all related information or other content in your account and/or bar any further access to such content or the Web Services. You agree that Knowledge shall not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access to any Web Service. The provisions of these Terms of Use pertaining to disclaimers, exclusion or damages, limitations of liability, indemnification and release shall survive termination.

### Governing Law and Jurisdiction

These Terms of Use, your use of the Web Services, and all related matters shall be governed solely by the laws of the Province of British Columbia, Canada and the applicable federal laws of Canada, without regard to the conflicts of law provisions of any jurisdiction. You hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of British Columbia in relation to all disputes arising from or related to these Terms of Use, your use of the Web Services and any related matters.

### No Waiver

No failure or delay by Knowledge in exercising any right or privilege under these Terms of Use will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial exercise of any right or privilege preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or privilege under these Terms of Use.

### Severability

If any part of these Terms of Use are determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable laws, including but not limited to the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provisions will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of these Terms of Use shall continue in effect.

### Entire Agreement

Unless specified herein, these Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between the user and Knowledge with respect to your use of the Web Services and the services offered at the Web Services, and it supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral or written, between the user and Knowledge with respect to the Web Services.

### Enurement

These Terms of Use are binding upon and shall enure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors, heirs, executor, administrators, personal representatives and permitted assigns.

### Compliance with Laws

Knowledge’s performance of this agreement is subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing contained in these Terms of Use is in derogation of Knowledge’s right to comply with governmental, court and law enforcement requests or requirements relating to your use of the Web Services or information provided to or gathered by Knowledge with respect to such use.

### Language of Contract

It is the express will of the parties that this agreement and all related documents have been drawn up in English. **C’est la volonté expresse des parties que la présente convention ainsi que les documents qui s’y rattachent soient rédigés en anglais.**
