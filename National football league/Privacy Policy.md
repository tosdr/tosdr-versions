NFL Enterprises LLC, the National Football League, the League's thirty-two member clubs ("Member Clubs"), and the other members of the [NFL Family](https://www.nfl.com/legal/privacy/nfl-entities-list/) (collectively, "NFL," "we," "our," "us") respect your privacy and value your trust and confidence. This privacy notice (the "Privacy Notice") applies to our websites, mobile applications, and other offline or online and mobile services that link to or post this Privacy Notice (collectively, the "Services"), and explains how we collect, use, and disclose information through the Services.

It is our policy to comply with applicable privacy laws and data protection laws, and so our privacy practices may vary depending on where you live. Please see the region-specific disclosures and applicable supplemental notices for more information relevant to data collected in certain regions and by individual member clubs.

By using the Services, you acknowledge that you have read and understood the terms of this Privacy Notice. Please note that this Privacy Notice does not apply to information collected in employment or job applicant contexts. For information about data handling practices in these contexts, please refer to the applicable privacy notices or seek more information from the relevant NFL entity. Likewise, this Privacy Notice may not apply when we collect information from you in other contexts, such as when you buy or use products or services that link to a separate privacy notice instead of this Privacy Notice. For example, this Privacy Notice does not apply to the NFL Credential Card Program, which is governed by a separate Stadium and Event Credentialing Privacy Policy.

Please also note that in some instances, we may direct you to a site or page that is operated by one of our partners or use framing techniques to serve you content from partners while preserving the look and feel of our website. Even though the page where you provide information may have the look and feel of the Services, a different privacy policy may govern that information collection by such partners.

The NFL works with certain third-party social media providers to offer you their social networking services through our Services. For example, you can use third-party social networking services to share information about your experience on our Services with your friends and followers on those social networking services.

You also may be able to link an account from a social networking service (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, or Snapchat) to an account through our Services. This may allow you to use your credentials from the other site or service to sign into certain features on our Services. If you link your account from a third-party site or service, we may collect information from those third-party accounts, and any information that we collect will be governed by this Privacy Notice.

**7\. Links to Other Websites**

The Services may contain links to other websites or online services that are operated and maintained by third parties and that are not under our control or maintained by us.

**8\. Data Security and Data Integrity**

The security and confidentiality of your personal information is very important to the NFL. We have implemented technical and organizational safeguards designed to appropriately protect your personal information against accidental, unauthorized, or unlawful access, use, loss, destruction, or damage. Still, no system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

As a result, while we strive to protect your information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to the Services and cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your information.

**9\. Data Transfers**

When we transfer your personal information to third parties as described in this Privacy Notice, some of these parties may be located in countries other than your own, such as the United States, whose privacy and data protection laws may not be equivalent to those in your country of residence. When we transfer your personal information to other countries, we apply appropriate safeguards, to protect your information in accordance with applicable laws. For example, some NFL entities implement measures such as standard data protection contractual clauses to ensure that any transferred personal information remains protected and secure. A copy of these clauses can be obtained by emailing [enquiries@nfl.com](mailto:enquiries@nfl.com). If you would like to know more about the processing of your personal information and whether your personal information is transferred to a third country, please contact us using any of the methods described in [Contact Us](https://www.nfl.com/legal/privacy/#ContactUs).

Please note that opt-out requests may take some time to be effective where permitted by applicable law.

Certain of our Services may feature Nielsen proprietary measurement software, which will allow users to contribute to market research, such as Nielsen TV Ratings. Nielsen believes that you should have a choice about whether to contribute to our research and insights.

2. To delete the personal information the NFL has collected about you.
3. To correct inaccurate personal information we have collected about you.

If you would like to object to, or request the restriction of, processing of your personal information, withdraw your consent, or if you are otherwise not able to submit a request via the portal above, you can contact the NFL by filling out an inquiry [here](https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/46acd508-0e8d-40cd-af22-1a8bdfa6da60/98ff85ff-6509-4336-b53c-3f2ce9c4d85f).

You may also be afforded, depending on where you reside and in accordance with applicable law, certain rights relating to the collection, use, and disclosure of your sensitive personal information.

* Where applicable, you may exercise the right to limit certain uses and disclosures of your sensitive personal information by clicking the "Your Privacy Choices" link at the footer of our sites or by clicking [here](https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/46acd508-0e8d-40cd-af22-1a8bdfa6da60/224a3598-1b25-497d-9273-be255f55461c).
* Where applicable, you may also withdraw your consent with respect to your sensitive personal information by submitting an inquiry [here](https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/46acd508-0e8d-40cd-af22-1a8bdfa6da60/98ff85ff-6509-4336-b53c-3f2ce9c4d85f). You may also withdraw your consent with respect to precise geolocation information using your device settings, as discussed above.

Please note that we may still maintain, use, and disclose your sensitive personal information for certain purposes, such as to provide you with services that you have requested, protect the safety and security of services, and comply with our legal obligations.

Depending on the jurisdiction in which you reside, you may also be afforded the right to opt out of the sale, sharing, or processing of your personal information for purposes of serving you advertisements based on your activity across other sites and services ("cross-context behavioral advertising" or "targeted advertising"). You may exercise these opt-out choices with respect to your cookie-based personal information by visiting "Privacy Settings" in applicable apps or the "Cookie Settings" link in the footer of applicable websites and toggling off Selling, Sharing, Targeted Advertising cookies. You may also exercise these opt-out choices with respect to your non-cookie-based personal information by clicking the "Your Privacy Choices" link in the footer of applicable sites.

Global Privacy Control and "Do Not Track" Signals: Our websites also support the Global Privacy Control ("GPC"), which is a browser-based opt-out preference signal that can communicate your state law opt-out requests to the websites you visit. For more information on how the GPC works, visit their website [here](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/). Because the GPC is browser-based, note that your choices will be tied to online data that is associated with your browser, and you should enable the signal separately for each browser and/or device from which you would like to be opted out. Our websites do not support "do-not-track" signals, as there is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals.

Note that we do not knowingly sell or share for cross-context behavioral advertising the personal information of consumers under 16 years of age.

We will not discriminate against you for exercising your rights and choices, although some of the functionality and features available to you may change or no longer be available to you. We may verify certain types of requests by requesting information sufficient to confirm your identity. Authorized agents may exercise rights on your behalf using the same mechanisms described herein, but we may request evidence that you have provided such agent with power of attorney or that the agent otherwise has valid authority to submit requests to exercise rights on your behalf.

We reserve the right to deny requests as allowed by applicable law, such as where we have a reasonable belief that the request is fraudulent, where your identity cannot be confirmed, or where the NFL must retain your information consistent with applicable law. You can, however, appeal those requests that we deny by submitting a request [here](https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/46acd508-0e8d-40cd-af22-1a8bdfa6da60/98ff85ff-6509-4336-b53c-3f2ce9c4d85f).

**14\. NFL Events**

Information When You Attend An NFL Event: When you attend an NFL-event or NFL co-hosted event, including NFL games at an NFL stadium or at a third party stadium or other NFL fan events (including events at which a fan mobile pass is utilized) ("NFL Event"), we may capture your image, voice and/or likeness, including through the use of CCTV cameras and/or when we film or photograph you in a public location at an NFL Event. You should therefore expect to be filmed or photographed by CCTV and/or by cameras when you are in a public location at an NFL Event (e.g., as an audience-member in the stadium if you are attending a game). In addition to describing how we capture and use your image, voice and/or likeness in this Privacy Notice, we may also display signs at any NFL Event indicating that you may be filmed or photographed.

We may use your personal information collected at an NFL Event:

* To produce, exhibit, advertise or otherwise use your image, voice, or likeness in any and all media now or existing in future as part of NFL's commercial, advertising and marketing activities; and

* In the case of images or footage captured on CCTV cameras, to ensure the safety of the venues hosting NFL Events and of individuals attending NFL Events.

Sharing your personal information from an NFL Event: We may disclose your personal information captured at an NFL Event with any of the entities set out in this Privacy Notice, as described in [Disclosure of Information](https://www.nfl.com/legal/privacy/#DisclosureofInformation). Additionally, when you appear in a photograph or film footage at an NFL Event, we may disclose that photograph or film footage containing your image, voice, and/or likeness with our third-party partners. These partners include our sponsors, licensees, advertisers, and/or broadcasters. We will disclose the photographs or film footage containing your image, voice and/or likeness when it is in our legitimate business interests to do so. However, each of the third-party partners may use your personal information for their independent commercial purposes without reference to the NFL.

Please also note that broadcasters and other third parties that are unconnected to the NFL may be independently filming or photographing you when you attend an NFL Event. Although we only give permission to a small group of entities (such as certain broadcasters) to film or photograph NFL Events, these entities are separate data controllers in respect of your personal information, and the NFL is not responsible for how those parties use your personal information and for what purposes.

**15\. Changes** **To This Privacy Notice**

We may update this Privacy Notice, including any supplemental privacy disclosures, to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes, we will notify you by email or by means of a notice on the Services prior to the change becoming effective.

**18\. International Users**

This section of the Privacy Notice is supplemental and provides disclosures in addition to those made elsewhere in this Privacy Notice. This supplemental section applies only if you attend an event outside of the United States or use our website or Services otherwise covered by this Privacy Notice from a country that is not the United States, and where the applicable member of the NFL Family is subject to jurisdiction-specific laws.

NFL Enterprises LLC is the data controller for League processing of personal information when you use our website and mobile applications. NFL International LLC is the data controller for League processing of personal information collected when you attend an NFL Event outside of the United States. Member Clubs may also be a data controller for certain club specific executions, and their entities are listed [here](https://www.nfl.com/legal/privacy/nfl-entities-list/).

Legal Basis for Data Processing: We process personal information for the specific purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, as described above. Where such concept is recognized, our legal basis to process personal information includes:

* Necessary for the entry into or performance of a contract: When you enter into a transaction with us, we will need to collect, process, and share your personal information. Failure to provide the requisite personal information when entering into such an agreement, objecting to this type of processing, and/or exercising your deletion rights may mean that products and/or services cannot be provided to you.

* Legitimate interest: In certain circumstances we may use your personal information to pursue legitimate interests of our own, but this is provided your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests. This is on the basis of our legitimate interest to:

o provide you with information and services as requested by you on a non-contractual basis;

o develop and improve our services to you and to our other customers;

o communicate with you and manage our relationship with you;

o administer our websites and applications;

o carry out management analysis, audit, forecasts, business planning, and transactions;

o ensure our compliance with applicable laws, regulatory requirements, and our policies; and

o deal with legal claims and related administrative activities.

We consider that it is reasonable for us to process your personal information for achieving our legitimate interests, as outlined above, as:

o We process your personal information only so far as is necessary to achieve the purpose outlined in this Privacy Notice; and

o The processing of your personal information does not unreasonably intrude on your privacy and ultimately benefits you in optimizing our provision of services to you.

* Consent: We may, on occasion and where permitted by law, process your personal information based on your consent. For example, where required by law, we will obtain consent to collect and process your sensitive personal information or to send you marketing messages by email. You may opt out of receiving certain marketing messages by exercising the choices described in [Communications and Geolocation Preferences](https://www.nfl.com/legal/privacy/#CommunicationsPreferencesandOtherChoices)**.**To the extent our processing is based on consent, you can withdraw your consent at any time. However, please note that the withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.

* Compliance with legal obligations: To meet our regulatory and legal obligations, we may need to process some of your personal information.

In some instances, you may be required to provide us with personal information for processing, as described above, in order for us to be able to provide you all of our Services and for you to use all the features of our website.

If you are aware of changes or inaccuracies in your information, you should inform us of such changes so that our records may be updated or corrected. You may lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority if you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes applicable law.

Except as otherwise prescribed by applicable law, in the event of any inconsistency between the English language version and local language version of this Privacy Notice, the English language version will prevail.
