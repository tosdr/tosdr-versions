#### **18\. Choice of Law, Class Action Waiver**, Small Claims, and Arbitration

PLEASE READ THIS SECTION \[18\] CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO LITIGATE (OR PARTICIPATE IN AS A PARTY OR CLASS MEMBER) ALL DISPUTES IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY. YOU HAVE THE LIMITED RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN THIS SECTION \[18\], OR ANY SUBSEQUENT CHANGES TO THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, AS SET FORTH BELOW.

You and we agree that these Terms and Conditions affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of the arbitration provisions.

With respect to any and all disputes arising out of or relating to the Services or this Agreement (including the Privacy Policy), you and the NFL agree to first negotiate in good faith to achieve a mutually satisfactory resolution, as provided in Section \[19\] below, before initiating a proceeding in any forum except as specifically set forth below.

**18.1 Choice of Law** **and Venue.**This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, excluding its conflict of law rules. By using the Services, you waive any claims that may arise under the laws of other states, countries, territories, or jurisdictions.

Unless you and the NFL agree otherwise, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the state and federal courts located in New York County, New York shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any action or proceeding between you and the NFL that is not subject to arbitration or that may be brought in small claims court and over any action seeking interim or preliminary relief. Each of you and the NFL voluntarily and irrevocably consents and (without waiving service of process) submits to personal jurisdiction and venue of the courts located in New York County, New York that have subject matter jurisdiction, waives all objections to venue and any claim that it is not personally subject to such jurisdiction or to seek a change of venue, and agrees not to bring any such action or proceeding in any other forum.

**18.2 Class Action Waiver.** ANY PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE, ARBITRATE OR LITIGATE ANY DISPUTE WILL BE CONDUCTED SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. NEITHER YOU NOR THE NFL WILL SEEK TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD AS A CLASS ACTION OR IN ANY OTHER PROCEEDING IN WHICH EITHER PARTY ACTS OR PROPOSES TO ACT IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. No arbitration or proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings.

**18.3 Small Claims Court.** Any dispute arising out of or relating to the Services or this Agreement (including the Privacy Policy) that falls within the jurisdictional scope and limits of the small claims court where you reside must be brought in that court on an individual basis. Such disputes must remain in small claims court and may not be removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction.

The party initiating the small claims court proceeding shall submit a certification of compliance with the Mandatory Pre-Dispute Resolution Process set forth in Section \[19\] to that court. The certification shall be personally signed by that party (and counsel, if represented).

**18.4 Arbitration Agreement\*\***.\*\* Except as otherwise provided herein, all disputes arising out of or relating to the Services or this Agreement (including the Privacy Policy) that cannot be settled through informal negotiation will be settled exclusively through confidential binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"). Except as modified by this Agreement, AAA shall administer the arbitration in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules and/or the Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules, as applicable (the "AAA Rules"). The AAA Rules and fee information are available at "[www.adr.org/consumer.”](http://www.adr.org/consumer.%E2%80%9D) If AAA is unable or unwilling to administer the arbitration consistent with the terms of this Agreement, the parties shall agree on an alternate administrator that will do so. If the parties cannot agree, they shall petition a court of competent jurisdiction in New York County, New York to appoint an alternate administrator that will do so.

The demand for arbitration must be personally signed by the party initiating arbitration (and their counsel, if represented). By signing the demand for arbitration, a party (and their counsel, if represented) certifies that they have complied with (i) the Mandatory Pre-Dispute Resolution Process in Section \[19\] and (ii) all of the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), including that the claims and relief sought are neither frivolous nor brought for an improper purpose. The arbitrator is authorized to award any relief or impose any sanctions available under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 or applicable federal or state law against all appropriate persons (including counsel) as a court would.

The arbitrator may award relief, including, but not limited to, monetary, declaratory, injunctive, or other equitable relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. The arbitrator may consider but will not be bound by rulings in other arbitrations where you and the NFL were not both parties. The arbitrator's award shall be binding and may be entered as a judgment in a court of competent jurisdiction. You agree that you or the NFL may seek any interim or preliminary relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in New York County, New York, as necessary to protect their rights or property (including intellectual property rights) pending the completion of arbitration. In addition, a court of competent jurisdiction in New York County, New York shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, validity, scope, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.

**Opt-Out.** If you do not wish to resolve disputes by binding arbitration, you may opt out of the provisions of this Section \[18.4\] within 30 days after the date that you first agree to this Agreement by sending a letter to Attn: Legal Department – Arbitration Opt-Out, National Football League, 345 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10154 that specifies: your full legal name, your email address (if applicable, the email address associated with any registration for the Services), and a statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration ("Opt-Out Notice"). Once the NFL receives your Opt-Out Notice, this Section \[18.4\] will be void. The remaining provisions of this Agreement will not be affected by your Opt-Out Notice. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, this Agreement does not prevent you or the NFL from participating in a mass settlement of claims, including from participating in a class-action settlement.

If the NFL makes any future change to the arbitration provisions in this Section \[18.4\] (other than a change to the notice address), you may reject any such change by sending a letter within 30 days after the date of such change to Attn: Legal Department – Arbitration Change Opt-Out, National Football League, 345 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10154 that specifies: your full legal name, your e-mail address (if applicable, the email address associated with any registration for the Services), and a statement that you wish to opt out of such change to the arbitration provisions ("Change Opt-Out Notice"). Once the NFL receives your Change Opt-Out Notice, any such change to the arbitration provisions in this Section \[18.4\] will be void as to you, but you will still be bound by the prior arbitration agreement that you accepted. For clarity, please note that this is not an opt out of arbitration altogether.

The terms of the arbitration provisions contained in Sections \[18\] and \[19\] herein will also apply to any claims asserted by you against any present or future parent, subsidiary or affiliated company of the NFL to the extent that any such claims arise out of your access to or use of the Services or the provision of content or technology on or through the Services.

**18.5 Additional Procedures for Mass Filings.**

(a) If your claim is one of twenty-five (25) or more similar claims intended to be asserted against the NFL by the same or coordinated counsel or are otherwise coordinated, consistent with the definition of Mass Arbitration set forth in the AAA Rules, you and we understand and agree that these Additional Procedures for Mass Filings will apply and the resolution of your dispute might be delayed. The parties agree that throughout this process, their counsel will meet and confer to discuss modifications to these procedures based on the particular needs of the mass filing.

The parties are encouraged to meet and confer throughout this staged process and to discuss potential ways to modify procedures, increase efficiencies, and resolve claims.

**Stage One**. Counsel for the claimants and counsel for the NFL will each select twenty-five (25) claims per side to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of the first staged process ("Stage One"). Absent agreement of the parties, no more than five (5) Stage One cases will be assigned to a single arbitrator. If there are fewer than fifty (50) claims, all will be filed in individual arbitrations. Any remaining claims will not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration, nor will any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After this initial set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties will engage in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge to be jointly selected by counsel for the parties, and the NFL will pay the mediation fee.

**Stage Two**. If the remaining claims are not resolved at this time, counsel for the claimants and counsel for the NFL will again each select twenty-five (25) claims per side to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a second staged process ("Stage Two"), subject to any procedural changes the parties agree to in writing following mediation or through continuing, good faith discussions. Absent agreement of the parties, no more than five (5) Stage Two cases will be assigned to a single arbitrator. If there are fewer than fifty (50) claims, all will be filed in individual arbitrations. Any remaining claims will not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration, nor will any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After this second set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties will engage in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge to be jointly selected by counsel for the parties, and the NFL will pay the mediation fee.

(b) Upon the conclusion of the second global mediation session (should the parties be unable to resolve the remaining claims), either

* Option One. You or the NFL may opt out of arbitration and elect to have your claim heard in a court of competent jurisdiction in New York County, New York consistent with the terms of this Agreement. For purposes of this Option One, you may opt out of arbitration by providing your individual, personally signed notice of your intention to opt out to the NFL via email at [NFLLegalNotice@nfl.com](mailto:NFLLegalNotice@nfl.com) within thirty (30) days after the conclusion of the second global mediation session. For purposes of this Option One, the NFL may opt your claim out of arbitration by sending an individual, personally signed notice of its intention to opt out to your counsel via email at the earliest possible time and no more than thirty (30) days following the expiration of your thirty (30) day opt-out period. Counsel for the parties may agree to adjust these deadlines. OR

* Option Two. If neither you nor the NFL elect to have your claim heard consistent with Option One above, then you agree that your claim will be resolved through continuing staged proceedings as set forth in this Option Two. If after the expiration of the NFL's opt-out period, the number of remaining claims exceeds two hundred (200), then two hundred (200) claims will be randomly selected (or selected through a process agreed to by counsel for the parties) to be filed and to proceed in arbitrations as part of a staged process. Absent agreement of the parties, no more than ten (10) cases in any set of two hundred (200) cases will be assigned to a single arbitrator. If the number of remaining claims is fewer than two hundred (200), then all of those claims will be filed and proceed in individual arbitrations. Any remaining claims will not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration, nor will any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until such remaining claims are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After each set of two hundred (200) claims are adjudicated, settled, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved, this staged process will repeat consistent the parameters in this Option Two. Counsel for the parties are encouraged to meet and confer, participate in mediation, and engage with each other and AAA to explore ways to streamline the adjudication of claims, increase the number of claims to proceed at any given time, promote efficiencies, conserve resources, and resolve the remaining claims.

(c) Any relevant limitations period (including statutes of limitations) and filing fee or other deadlines will be tolled subject to these Additional Procedures for Mass Filings from the time the first cases are selected for a staged process until your claim is selected to proceed as part of a staged process or is settled, withdrawn, otherwise resolved, or opted out of arbitration.

(d) You and the NFL agree that we each value the integrity and efficiency of arbitration and wish to employ the process for the fair resolution of genuine and sincere disputes between us. You and the NFL acknowledge and agree to act in good faith to ensure the processes set forth herein are followed. The parties further agree that application of these Additional Procedures for Mass Filings has been reasonably designed to result in an efficient and fair adjudication of claims.

(e) A court of competent jurisdiction in New York County, New York will have the authority to enforce these Additional Procedures for Mass Filings and, if necessary, to enjoin the mass filing, prosecution, or administration of arbitrations and the assessment of arbitration fees. If these Additional Procedures for Mass Filings apply to your claim, and a court of competent jurisdiction in New York County, New York determines they are not enforceable as to your claim, the mandatory arbitration provisions of this Agreement, including the Additional Procedures for Mass Filings, are non-severable from one another and therefore your claim then must proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction in New York County, New York consistent with the terms of this Agreement.

#### **19\. Mandatory Pre-Dispute Resolution Process**

**19.1** To the maximum extent permitted by law, you and the NFL permanently and irrevocably waive the right to bring any claim in any forum unless the party bringing the claim provides the other party with written notice of the dispute within one (1) year of its occurrence by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail. The NFL's address for Notice is: Attn: Legal Department, National Football League, 345 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10154. The written notice (a "Notice of Dispute") must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought.

**19.2** Before initiating a proceeding in arbitration or small claims court, you or the NFL must provide a Notice of Dispute that is personally signed by you (if you are initiating the Notice of Dispute) or by an NFL representative (if we are initiating the Notice of Dispute). The NFL must send any such Notice of Dispute to you at the contact information the NFL has on file for you via email. The NFL and you will attempt to resolve the dispute through informal negotiation within 60 days from the date that the Notice of Dispute is received (or a longer period, if agreed to by the parties).

**19.3** The NFL and you will use reasonable, good faith efforts to resolve the dispute through consultation, cooperation, and good faith negotiations. If the party receiving the Notice of Dispute requests a telephonic settlement conference as part of this informal process, you and the NFL agree to participate in an effort to resolve the dispute. Should the NFL make the request, you agree to attend this conference (with your counsel, if you are represented). Should you make the request, the NFL agrees to have a representative attend this conference (with counsel, if the NFL is represented). Neither you nor the NFL may initiate an arbitration proceeding before the conclusion of the sixty (60) day period from the time the Notice of Dispute is received, or otherwise absent full compliance with the process described in this Section \[19.3\] (collectively, the "Mandatory Pre-Dispute Resolution Process"). You agree that you or the NFL may seek any interim or preliminary relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in New York County, New York, as necessary to protect their rights or property (including intellectual property rights) pending completion of the Mandatory Pre-Dispute Resolution Process.

**19.4** If the sufficiency of a Notice of Dispute or compliance with this Mandatory Pre-Dispute Resolution Process is at issue, it may be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction in New York County, New York at either party's election, and any formal dispute resolution proceeding will be stayed. Such court has the authority to enforce this condition precedent to an arbitration proceeding, which includes the power to enjoin the filing or prosecution of a demand for arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party retains the right to raise non-compliance with this condition precedent and seek related damages in arbitration. Any applicable limitations period (including statutes of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines will be tolled while you and the NFL engage in the Mandatory Pre-Dispute Resolution Process.
