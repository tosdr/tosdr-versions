### Terms and Conditions

_These Terms were last updated on August 27th, 2024._

General Terms and Conditions

**1\. General Terms and Conditions.**

**1.1            These Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) Govern our Solution.**  WHEN YOU SIGN AN ORDER FORM WITH US, OR CONTINUE TO USE OUR SOLUTION AFTER THE “LAST UDPATED” DATE OF THESE TERMS, YOU ARE AGREEING TO THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF YOUR ORGANIZATION.  These Terms refer to Digital River as “us,” “we,” or “our” and  to your business organization as “you” or “your”. For purposes of these Terms, we refer to the sale of a license to digital product(s) and the sale of a service use right to services as a “sale” of a “product,” even though digital product(s) and services are licensed and not sold.

**1.2            Our Solution; Appointment of Digital River as Reseller.**  Digital River’s product is a fully-integrated suite of back-end services – payments, tax, fraud and compliance – called Global Seller Services (“**GSS**”).  GSS is enabled by our business model, where we act as an online reseller of your products. When you use our Solution to sell your products, you appoint Digital River, and Digital River accepts the appointment, to resell your products to shoppers.

**1.3            Applicable Terms**. Use of the Solution is governed by these Terms, the below Service Level Agreement, Data Handling Standards, Guidelines and Best Practices, and mutually approved Order Form (collectively the “**Agreement**”).  The Order Form is the only portion of the Agreement you will sign.

**1.4            Your Business and Shopper Experience.**  You are fully responsible for all aspects of your business and shopper experiences, including:  (i) your website and online shopping experience; (ii) your online order capture experience (to the extent we are not directly providing the capture experience for you); (iii) your products and services; (iv) shopper relations, including support service for any installation, use, configuration and operation of your products and services; (v) your systems or the systems you procure from third parties, including any downtime, errors or fraud on such systems; (vi) your personnel; and (vii) your compliance with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to your responsibilities.

**1.5            Use of the Solution** In order to connect to and use the Solution you must implement and maintain your ecommerce shopper experience in accordance with the Agreement and Application Programming Interface(s) (“APIs”) for the Solution and so that your shopper/transaction data follows the rules required to transact business related to the Solution in the applicable territory.

**1.6            Information You Provide.** Our Solution is dependent upon the information you provide to us (e.g., we must know about your products in order for our Solution to legitimately resell your products, process payments for your products, calculate any taxes due, and for our software logic to help determine if a purchase is fraudulent), so you must provide to us in a timely manner all information in your control reasonably required by us to comply with our obligations, as further addressed in the Guidelines & Best Practices. You must respond promptly to any request for direction, information, or approval that is reasonably necessary for us to deliver the Solution for you or protect our rights under the Agreement.  The information you provide must be accurate, true and complete, and if any information is or becomes materially inaccurate or incomplete, you must immediately notify us.

**1.7            Licenses.**  During the term of your use of the Solution, (i) we grant you a license to use our APIs and/or administration interface applicable to the Solution solely for your use of the Solution, and (ii) if the Solution requires either of us to use the other party’s trademarks and logos to perform or use the Solution, we each hereby grant the other party a license to do so solely as required in connection with the performance or use of the Solution under the Agreement, and only in the form and with appropriate legends as required by the other party. You agree we may announce the relationship in a mutually approved press release within 60 days of initially entering into an Order Form with you, and you and us both agree to work together on joint marketing initiatives.

**1.8            Ownership and Intellectual Property.**  As between you and us, you own all of your Confidential Information and materials you provide to us, whether electronic or physical, in the course of performing your obligations under these Terms (including without limitation your products, trademarks and logos, as may be applicable) and all proprietary and intellectual property rights thereto.  As between us and you, we own the Solution, its constituent parts, our software, marks, logos, work product, information prepared by, provided by, or used by us (other than the materials you provide to us), and any modifications or improvements to them, and all proprietary and intellectual property rights thereto.

**1.9        Confidentiality.**  We and you each agree, as it relates to our or your respective handling of confidential information, to maintain in strict confidence and to use only to deliver or use the Solution or as otherwise authorized by the other party, all information received under the Agreement which is of a confidential nature concerning the other party’s business operations, technical and financial information, employees, suppliers, providers or shoppers (**“Confidential Information”**).  Information will not be deemed Confidential Information if it is or becomes generally available to the public without breach of the Agreement or is independently developed by the non-disclosing party or its personnel or representatives without reliance in any way on Confidential Information of the disclosing party.

In connection with our performance, tracking and improvement of the Solution we may disclose Confidential Information to our third-party providers (such as our corporate affiliates, merchant/acquiring banks and contractors) and you may disclose Confidential Information to your third-party providers to the extent necessary for your use of the Solution.

Any such third-party to whom Confidential Information is disclosed must be subject to a written confidentiality obligation no less restrictive than this provision, and the disclosing party will remain liable for any breach by them of this confidentiality provision.  You or we may disclose Confidential Information required to be disclosed by law or court order so long as the disclosing party provides prompt written notice to the other party (if not prohibited by law), tries to limit the disclosure to the minimum amount required and obtains confidential treatment or a protective order, and, if requested, cooperates with the other party to do so.  We may also use and disclose anonymized and/or aggregated information relating to usage of the Solution that does not identify you or any particular shopper or supplier (such as aggregated conversion data to help optimize future sales conversion rates and fraud data to continually improve our anti-fraud logic for future transactions), and we may disclose information stored in our Solution if we believe it is required to do so by law or to reduce risk of credit or other kind of fraud.

**1.10        Protection of Personal Data.** We and you each agree, as applicable, to comply with all applicable data protection and data privacy laws, rules, and regulations as they relate to our or your respective handling, control of and/or processing of personal data (or similar defined terms under applicable laws) as set forth in the Data Handling Standards.  We agree to be liable for any breach of this paragraph by our subcontractors or agents, if any are involved in performing the Solution.

**1.11         Material Change in Circumstances.**  If you are subject to a material change in circumstances (including without limitation a change in ownership, a material change in your financial condition, a material change in your products or services, or a change in the laws or regulations applicable to your business) that we believe, in good faith, is likely to cause you or us to be in violation of an applicable law, rule or regulation or which represents a material economic or liability risk to us, we may immediately, on notice to you, (i) establish and maintain an offset in an amount we in good faith specify, based on an increased risk to us of chargebacks, refunds, or penalties; (ii) institute a delay in our payments to you; (iii) suspend or limit your use of the Solution; or (iv) terminate this Agreement.

**1.12         Term.**  The Agreement governs your use of the Solution until for as long as you use the Solution. The term for each Solution is defined in the Order Form and will automatically renew for one (1) year periods unless either party provides written notice of termination to the other at least ninety (90) days in advance of the end of the then-current term.

**1.13         Termination.** 

1.13.1     Either party may terminate the Agreement or an affected Solution (i) upon thirty (30) days’ advance written notice to the other if the other party is in breach of the Agreement and does not cure the breach within the 30-day notice period, or (ii) if the other party initiates or has initiated against it any proceeding under any statute or law for the modification or adjustment of the rights of creditors which is not dismissed within sixty (60) calendar days from the date of filing.

1.13.2     In addition, you may terminate the Agreement or an affected Solution on thirty (30) days’ advance notice if we (i) modify the Agreement or a Solution in a manner that materially impairs the Solution, you provide us written notice of termination detailing the impairment within thirty (30) days after the modification becomes effective, and we do not rectify the impairment within the 30-day notice period, or (ii) consistently and repeatedly fail to make timely payments for sales transactions to you.

1.13.3     In addition, we may suspend or terminate the Agreement or the Solution without penalty immediately upon written notice to you (i) if we determine in good faith that you are in breach of this Agreement as a result of activity that (a) is illegal, (b) is a violation of applicable rules, regulations or guidelines of a card association, processor/acquiring bank, or legal or regulatory payment authority with which we must comply when reselling your products, (c) violates our territorial restrictions for permitted commerce, or (d) violates our restrictions for the types of product we will resell; (ii) if we are directed to do so by a card association, processor/acquiring bank, or legal or regulatory payment authority; or (iii) in accordance with Section 1.11.  We will notify you of any suspension or termination of your use of the Solution and where possible will consult with you before taking such action.

1.13.4      Upon termination (or after any applicable wind down period included in the Agreement), (a) you may no longer use the Solution (including any of our software, such as our APIs and/or administration interface) and we will stop providing them, (b) each party must promptly return or destroy the other party’s Confidential Information (and, if requested, provide an officer’s certification of destruction), (c) subject to all legal requirements, we will provide a facility for thirty (30) days for you to export the personal information of shoppers of your products (except their payment information, such as credit/debit card and account information) provided to us when we perform the Solution, after which we may delete shopper data, except to the extent we are required by law to maintain it, (d) we will work with you in good faith to promptly and expeditiously transfer to you the information necessary for recurring payments for products we have resold, provided that you are PCI compliant, the data is transferred in a PCI-compliant manner, and the transfer is compliant with all legal, regulatory, or other requirements applicable to us as the holder of the data, including any applicable notice requirements, which may vary by jurisdiction, and (e) the provisions of the Agreement that require or may require performance after termination will survive.

1.13.5      Following any notice of termination or non-renewal, we may create an offset from remaining payments due to you in an amount we reasonably estimate to cover potential chargebacks, refunds, or penalties that may occur following the effective date of termination (the “**Wind-down Offset**”). After termination of this Agreement, we will release portions of the Wind-down Offset monthly based on the decrease in risk exposure until the full Wind-down Offset is released, no later than one hundred and eighty (180) days following the termination of this Agreement.

**1.14         Representations and Warranties; Limitations on Liability; Indemnification.** 

1.14.1     Representations and Warranties.  Each party represents, warrants and covenants that:

1.14.3      Limitations on Liability

IN ACCORDANCE WITH RISK ALLOCATIONS THAT ARE STANDARD WITHIN THE SELLER AND PAYMENT SERVICES INDUSTRY, THE PRICING FOR WHICH THE SOLUTION IS MADE AVAILABLE TO CLIENTS, AND THE REVENUE WE EARN UNDER THE AGREEMENT COMPARED TO THE REVENUE EARNED BY CLIENTS FOR TRANSACTIONS USING THE SOLUTION, RISKS BETWEEN US ARE ECONOMICALLY ALIGNED AS FOLLOWS:  THE AMOUNT OF OUR LIABILITY IS UNLIMITED FOR OUR INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTION 1.14.4, OUR PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS, OR TO THE EXTENT WE ARE GROSSLY NEGLIGENT OR COMMIT WILLFUL MISCONDUCT.  OTHERWISE YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AND OUR ENTIRE LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM RELATED TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE AGREEMENT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, IS LIMITED TO THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF ALL FEES WE RECEIVED UNDER THE AGREEMENT DURING THE TWELVE MONTHS PRIOR TO WHEN THE FIRST CLAIM AROSE.  WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY (i) LOSS OR INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, (ii) ACCESS LIMITATIONS, DELAYS, INTERRUPTIONS OR DISTURBANCES TO THE SOLUTION, (iii) MISTAKES, DISTORTIONS OR DELAYS IN TRANSMISSIONS OF ELECTRONICALLY STORED INFORMATION, INCLUDING DISAPPEARANCES OF SUCH INFORMATION, (iv) ACTIONS OR INACTIONS BY YOU OR OF THIRD PARTIES (SUCH AS SHOPPERS OR YOUR SUPPLIERS), (v) AGREEMENTS YOU HAVE WITH YOUR SHOPPERS OR SUPPLIERS, OR FOR YOUR PRODUCTS, SERVICES, OR SYSTEMS, OR (vi) EVENTS BEYOND OUR REASONABLE CONTROL.

THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY IN THESE TERMS APPLY EVEN IF A REMEDY IS DEEMED TO HAVE FAILED ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. EACH PARTY acknowledgeS that THE OTHER PARTY’S acceptance of THIS Section has materially induced THE OTHER PARTY to enter INTO THE AGREEMENT AND PERMIT THE USE OF AND/OR USE THE SOLUTION. BECAUSE SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, IN SUCH JURISDICTIONS, EACH PARTY’S LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

1.14.4      Indemnification.  Each party agrees to indemnify, defend and hold the other party harmless against any third party claim, and resulting liabilities, damages and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees (**“Claims”**), that its business, products or services (in our case, the Solution) violate any law, rule or regulation or any third party intellectual property rights, or for its fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence.  In addition, because you are responsible for your products and your business, and because our Solution relies on and processes the information and instructions you provide to us, you agree to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless against any Claims for (i) your failure to comply with Section 1.4 (Your Business),  Section 1.6 (Information You Provide), or Section 1.16 (Our “Know Your Customer” and Anti-Money Laundering Regulatory Obligations) of these Terms, and (ii) any failure to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations to the extent the failure is caused by or results from your instructions, actions or omissions.

To be indemnified, the party seeking indemnity must give the indemnifying party prompt written notice of the claim, reasonable assistance, and sole authority to defend and settle the claim. In the defense or settlement of an infringement claim hereunder (or if we reasonably believe the Solution or any portion of the Solution does or may infringe the rights of a third party), we will have the option at our expense to (iii) modify the Solution to become non-infringing, or (iv) obtain for you the right to continue using the Solution, or if we determine in our discretion that (iii) or (iv) is not reasonably commercially available, then (v) terminate the Agreement with respect to the Solution and provide you a prorated refund of recurring fees previously received by us hereunder for the Solution corresponding to any period after the effective date of such termination.

**1.15         Insurance.**   For so long as this Agreement is in effect plus two years after, we and you must each maintain insurance coverage with reputable insurance carriers of at least: $1,000,000 per occurrence and $2,000,000 in the aggregate for each of the following – products liability, commercial general liability, professional liability/errors and omissions with cyber risk and privacy coverage, and worker’s compensation with statutory limits. A party shall provide the other party with certificates of insurance upon request.

**1.16         Our “Know Your Customer” and Anti Money Laundering Regulatory Obligations.**  To set up your account, you must provide us certain information, which includes our Know Your Customer account verification form and may include additional information required to comply with anti-money laundering regulations. As part of our diligence, we may engage in any investigation of your finances, activities, and operations that we reasonably deem necessary to confirm your eligibility for and use of the Solution, and you agree to provide us with information reasonably required to complete such investigation. You authorize us to share any information we collect or receive from or about you with the card associations, processor/acquiring banks or legal or regulatory payment authorities.  You authorize us to conduct a customary commercial background check for these purposes and to assess the risk of our doing business with you. You agree to provide us with written notice not more than five (5) days after you receive a subpoena, civil investigative demand, or similar request for information from a federal, state, or local government, agency, or entity relating to your products and services sold through the Solution or your use of the Solution.

**1.17            Controls.** We are committed to maintaining Service Organization Controls (SOC 1 and SOC 2) for financial and security controls. You may visit the Digital River compliance site to request access and review our compliance reports, which are our Confidential Information. Our compliance site is found at www.digitalriver.com/compliance.

**1.18         Modifications.**  From time to time in the course of our business we may modify the Agreement and/or the Solution (for example, to remain in compliance with changing laws, rules, regulations and market conditions around the world, or as required by the card associations).  We will provide at least thirty (30) days’ advance notice via electronic posting or e-mail of any material change to the Agreement or to the Solution, unless applicable laws or regulatory requirements require us to give earlier notice. We will provide at least forty-five (45) days’ advance notice via e-mail to the Legal Notice email address stated on the Order Form for any changes to Section 1, General Terms and Conditions.  If the change materially impairs the Solution, you may terminate the Agreement and your use of the Solution in accordance with Section 1.13.2.  Subject to your termination rights in Section 1.13.2, your continued use of the Solution after the effective date of any modification to the Solution or the Agreement constitutes your acceptance of such modification.

**1.19        Electronic Documents.** We provide our documents electronically rather than in paper form.  We will notify you that a document is available with a link to that document.  At any time and without giving advance notice, we may elect not to send a document electronically, in which case a paper copy of the document will be sent to you at your corporate address on file.

**1.20         Miscellaneous.**  These Terms, the applicable Standards, including the Guidelines and Best Practices, and the relevant mutually approved Order Form constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and in the Order Form, and supersede any previous and contemporaneous agreements and understandings with respect to the subject matter hereof.  No provisions in your purchase orders or your other business forms will alter the Agreement.  Amendments may only be made by a written agreement in an Order Form executed by authorized officers of both parties and by us in accordance with Section 1.18.  If there is any conflict between the provisions in the Agreement and any mutually approved Order Form between the parties, the mutually approved Order Form will control.

**1.21         Notices.**  Notices sent to either party must be given in writing and will be deemed effective on the date of delivery: to you, at the most recent postal or e-mail address you provided to us in your account registration, or to us, at our corporate office identified on our website, attention General Counsel, when delivered by commercial carrier and evidenced by the delivery receipt.

**1.22        Independent Contractors.**  The parties are independent contractors, and not partners or joint venturers.  Neither party has the right, power or authority to act or create any obligation on behalf of the other party. We may engage the services of subcontractors or agents to assist us in the performance of our obligations.  Because a subcontractor (such as a payment provider) or agent may perform the same function for many or all clients, and we require flexibility to switch or alternate subcontractors and agents to ensure service level standards, pricing commitments or other obligations under this Agreement, we are unable to inform individual clients or seek approval from individual clients each time there is a change or reassignment of a subcontractor or agent; however we will be responsible for the acts and omissions of our subcontractors and agents in the performance of such obligations under the Agreement.

**1.23         Third Party Requirements.** For certain additional and optional services available through the Solution, you may be required to agree to additional appendices and/or agreements with us and/or our third-party financial institutions, processors, or card associations that contain terms and obligations specific to those services. Any third-party financial institution, processor or payment services provider is an independent third party and we are not liable for any actions or inactions of third parties, included but not limited to, a third party’s unwillingness to work with you.

**1.24        Assignment.**  Neither party may assign the Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party except in connection with a merger or sale of all or substantially all of its assets or equity, but in such event the assigning party must provide prompt written notice to the non-assigning party of the change and the non-assigning party may terminate the Agreement if the assignment is to a direct competitor of the non-assigning party.  The Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their permitted successors and assigns.

    | Level 4 | * Impact: Low<br>* Our Classification: Minimal impact to the Solution<br>* Acknowledgment: Within two (2) business days<br>* Issue Resolution: We will evaluate and incorporate into maintenance release as we deem appropriate |
    
    For the purposes of this table, the “Acknowledgment” is the time from when we first learn of a problem to when we initially contact to you by email or telephone acknowledging such reported issue; and “Issue Resolution” is when we substantially resolve the issue or begin a plan to resolve the issue, whichever occurs first.
    
7. Remedies. If we fail to meet our availability commitment in any calendar quarter during which we were compensated for your use of the Solution, your sole and exclusive remedy is a service level credit as follows, subject to your rights in case of a continuous failure as described in section 8 below. The service level credit is calculated by applying the service credit percentage to the charges we earned and received less the cost of payment processing for transactions we processed during that calendar quarter for your use of the Solution. We will apply any service credits only against future Solution charges otherwise due from you. Service credits will not entitle you to any refund or other payment from us. Subject to section 8 below, the foregoing is your sole and exclusive remedy for our breach.
    
    | Quarterly Uptime Percentage | Service Credit Percentage |
    | --- | --- |
    | Less than 99.9% but greater than or equal to 99.0% | 10% |
    | Less than 99.0% but greater than or equal to 95.0% | 25% |
    | Less than 95.0% | 50% |
    
    1. Remedy Procedure. To receive a service credit, you must submit a claim by opening a case with our Customer Success Team. To be eligible, we must receive your credit request within 30 days’ after the end of the calendar quarter in which the service level commitment was not met and must include:
        
        1. the words “SLA Credit Request – Solution” in the subject line;
        2. the dates and times of each period of unavailability that you are claiming;
        3. the calendar quarter with respect to which you are claiming service credits;
        4. Your request logs that document the errors and corroborate your claimed outage (any confidential or sensitive information in the logs should be removed or replaced with asterisks).
        
        If we confirm the Quarterly Uptime Percentage is less than our service commitment, then we will issue you a service credit within one billing cycle following the quarter in which we confirm your request. If you don’t provide your request and other information needed above, you will be disqualified from receiving a service credit.
        
8. Alternative Remedy in Case of Continuous Failure. Should we fail to meet our availability commitment in any two (2) consecutive calendar quarters during which we were compensated for your use of the Solution, you shall, as an alternative remedy, be entitled to terminate the Agreement upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to us. For the avoidance of doubts, in case you decide to terminate the Agreement based on this provision you shall not be entitled to receive additional service credits for the calendar quarter giving rise to such termination right.In the event you fail to provide us with notice of such termination within forty-five (45) calendar days of the end of the calendar quarter giving rise to such termination right, you shall be deemed to have waived its right to terminate the Agreement for such failure (but shall have the right to so terminate if the condition is met in any subsequent two (2) calendar quarters).

### Data Handling Standards

**Data Handling Standards**

Effective as of August 12, 2022

These Standards are in addition to the terms in the Agreement. Words used in these Standards with an initial capital letter have the same meaning (i) as defined in these standards in Section 13 “Definitions;” (ii) as found in the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR); (iii) as found in the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA); or (iv) as found in the Agreement. Where a term in these Standards conflicts with a corresponding term in the Agreement, the term in these Standards will control with respect to the parties’ obligations under these Standards.

**1\. Background and Purpose.** Each party is responsible for privacy, data security, and compliance with any global Data Protection Legislation that may apply to your commerce solution. These Standards were created to allow us to have an open data sharing arrangement with you. The purpose is to ensure that any transfers of data between the parties are completed using appropriate safeguards, and that each party understands its obligations under Data Protection Legislation. Here, we have laid out the obligations of each party, including our respective responsibilities under Data Protection Legislation.

**2\. Obligations of the Parties.** You and we will each maintain the responsibility of being an (Independent) Data Controller for Personal Data. As such, each party is responsible for ensuring that Personal Data is Processed according to Data Protection Legislation and that there is a lawful basis for its Processing activities.

**3\. Description of Personal Data and Purpose of Processing.** Each party will process Personal Data of those purchasers that purchase a title, license right, and/or usage right to a product using our Service (the “Shopper”). Those categories of Personal Data may include names, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, IP addresses, and other related transaction information.

The Personal Data will be processed independently by each party for the following purposes:

*  To provide the Shoppers with the services they have requested, in accordance with the relevant party’s privacy policy,
* To ensure the performance of the parties’ obligations under the Agreement,
*  To provide other similar services to Shoppers where the Shoppers have, if applicable, consented to such services, and as decided by each party as its own (Independent) Data Controller,
*  To share the data with third parties, Service Providers, and use Processors to process the data so long as the parties comply with Data Protection Legislation; and
* Digital River agrees that it will only independently process the Shopper Personal Data for the following purposes: performing its obligations under the Agreement, fulfilling Shopper transactions, collecting Shopper payments, conducting fraud screening, providing support to Shoppers, preventing, detecting, or investigating fraud, employing independent fraud modeling, detection, and risk analytics, payment optimization, and generally complying with its contractual or other obligations to the Shopper and complying with its legal obligations. For clarity, DR will not process Shopper Personal Data to market to end users.

For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that neither party receives valuable consideration for, and no Sale has occurred as a result of the transfer of data from one party to another. Any transfer of data between the parties is done for the purpose of fulfilling and processing shopper-initiated transactions and for providing related support.

**4\. Information Provided to Shoppers.** The parties agree to include the applicable link to each party’s privacy policy, prior to the collection by such party, of the Shopper’s Personal Data, so that it is clear to the Shopper which privacy policy applies to the processing of their data. For the avoidance of doubt, your privacy policy will govern how you will process Personal Data and ours will govern how we will process Personal Data. We are each responsible for fulfilling our promises as outlined in our respective privacy policies.  
Where applicable, you will gather and document the applicable consents from Shoppers for the processing of their data, such as for marketing activities. And, where there is another lawful basis for the processing (such as “Legitimate Interests”) you will also document the applicable lawful basis and your reasoning behind such decision(s).

**5\. Data Handling Requests; Notifying the Other party.** Data Protection Legislation, such as GDPR and CCPA, grants Shoppers certain rights regarding their personal data that a Data Controller holds and obligates Data Controllers to facilitate the exercise of those rights. As such, each party is responsible for facilitating the exercise of Shoppers’ rights under applicable law and must send any applicable data handling requests to the other party without undue delay.

Such rights may include the right to consent, and to withdraw the consent, the right of access, rectification, restriction of Processing, erasure, data portability, and the right to object to Processing. It is up to each party to ensure the Shoppers’ rights are honored as appropriate, considering applicable legal requirements. It is also each party’s responsibility to ensure that the Shopper has been appropriately authenticated under Data Protection Legislation prior to acting on any access request.

Specifically, as it relates to data erasure requests from a Shopper, we request that you log into our administration interface software (or successor user interface) and click on the “Request Removal of Personal Information” button, which will automatically trigger a notification to us. You may also send any communications related to such data handling requests to the Digital River contact point(s) noted in the Order Form under “Privacy.”

**6\. Security of Personal Data.** Each party agrees to take reasonable steps to provide a level of security appropriate to the sensitivity of the Personal Data in each party’s control.

*  Each party represents, warrants and covenants to the other party that (i) it has implemented technical and organizational security measures, which meet industry standards and comply with all applicable Data Protection Legislation, to prevent any unauthorized access, use or disclosure of Personal Data, and (ii) its processing of Personal Data will at all times be performed in accordance with such technical and organizational security measures; and
*  Each Party represents and warrants that it has in place and in writing a business continuity and disaster recovery plan; and
* To the extent required by applicable law, the parties will not transfer the Personal Data to a processor, vendor, service provider, subcontractor or sub-processor (a “Processor”), unless (i) it has first concluded a written agreement with the Processor that imposes obligations and restrictions on the third-party at least as restrictive as those that apply to the other party under these Standards (“Processing Agreements”), and (ii) such transfer complies with applicable Data Protection Legislation; and
* The party who has transferred Personal Data to the Processor shall be liable for the acts or omissions of that Processor with respect to Personal Data.

**7\. Security Breach.** With respect to any Security Breach, the parties will take all steps reasonably necessary to (i) investigate and remediate the effects of such occurrence, (ii) mitigate any harm to those Shoppers that are affected or could be affected by such occurrence, (iii) prevent the re-occurrence, and (iv) comply with applicable Data Protection Legislation.

Each party shall notify the other party in writing or by phone (for Digital River, the phone number is 952-253-1234, attention: Legal) after becoming aware of any compromise of the Personal Data that may affect the other party. The responsible party shall also notify the Supervisory Authority and Shoppers, where required and within the applicable time period under Data Protection Legislation. As such, the parties will coordinate with, consult with and keep the other party regularly informed related to its response to any Security Breach.

**8\. Transfers of Personal Data Outside of the EEA or United Kingdom.** A party shall not transfer Personal Data (nor permit any Personal Data to be transferred) to a territory outside of the EEA or the United Kingdom unless it has taken such measures as are necessary to ensure the transfer complies with applicable law. The parties acknowledge that adequate protection for the Personal Data must exist for any transfer and will, if needed, enter into an appropriate written agreement governing such transfer of Personal Data, including, but not limited to Standard Contractual Clauses, taking into account the level of protection of the third country and taking additional steps to guarantee protection, if necessary, unless another appropriate safeguard for the transfer exists.

To the extent that that the Agreement involves the transfer of Personal Data outside of the EEA or United Kingdom, the parties agree that Standard Contractual Clauses shall be incorporated into the Agreement. To that end, for agreements entered into on or after September 27, 2021 the Standard Contractual Clauses applicable to the transfer of Personal Data outside of the EEA [EU Standard Contractual Clauses](https://preprod.drstaging.com/legal-other/eu-standard-contractual-clauses-commerce-connector-solutions/) (https://preprod.drstaging.com/legal-other/eu-standard-contractual-clauses-commerce-connector-solutions/), plus the relevant Privacy Details in the Order Form shall constitute the completed EU Standard Contractual Clauses, and the International Data Transfer Agreement applicable to the transfer of Personal Data outside of the [UK Standard Contractual Clauses](https://www.digitalriver.com/legal-other/uk-standard-contractual-clauses-commerce-connector-solutions/)  (https://preprod.drstaging.com/legal-other/uk-standard-contractual-clauses-commerce-connector-solutions/), plus the relevant Privacy Details in the Order Form shall constitute the completed UK Standard Contractual Clauses. For agreements entered into prior to September 27, 2021, the contractual requirements for the transfer of Personal Data to Controllers established in third countries found in the European Commission’s Decision 2004/915/EC of 27 December 2004 plus the Privacy details in the Order form shall constitute completed Standard Contractual Clauses and shall remain in full force and effect until the Parties enter into an amendment adopting new Standard Contractual Clauses. Where and to the extent Standard Contractual Clauses apply pursuant to this Clause, if there is any conflict between these Standards and the Standard Contractual Clauses, the Standard Contractual Clauses shall prevail.

**9\. Liabilities and Indemnification.** Each party agrees to be held solely liable for the performance of its obligations under Data Protection Legislation and these Standards, and any costs associated with a party’s failure to comply with Data Protection Legislation and these Standards, including any fines imposed by a Supervisory Authority (or its equivalent), shall be paid by the party that failed to comply.  
While nothing in the Agreement or these Standards shall be construed as making the parties, acting as (Independent) Data Controllers, involved in the same processing, should, pursuant to Article 82(4) of the GDPR, a party be found to be liable for the entire damage arising from a breach or breaches of the GDPR relating to activities under these Standards, in order to ensure effective compensation of one or more individuals, then that party shall indemnify the other party for that portion of the compensation attributable to any breaches of the GDPR for which it is responsible.

**10\. Requests from Supervisory Authorities.** The parties agree to cooperate with each other when they receive a request from a Supervisory Authority or court of law that impacts the other party. Where one party receives the request (the “Receiving Party”), the Receiving Party shall communicate the request to the other party promptly, and where possible, prior to responding to the Supervisory Authority or court of law. However, if this is not possible due to the immediacy of the request, the Receiving Party shall communicate the request to the other party as soon as reasonably possible after submission of the response.

**11\. Survival of these Standards.** Regardless of whether the Agreement is terminated or expires, if either party has access to, processes or otherwise retains Personal Data, the parties agree to comply with all applicable requirements under Data Protection Legislation. Therefore, the applicable sections of these Standards that relate to the parties’ obligations under Data Protection Legislation, survives any termination or expiration of the Agreement. To the extent there are no further obligations of the parties under Data Protection Legislation, these Standards will terminate. Also, and for the avoidance of doubt, each party is responsible for destroying the Personal Data in accordance with applicable laws and neither party is required to return to the other party the Personal Data that is in their possession.

**12\. Applicable Law and Dispute Resolution.** These Standards (including the Agreement) constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and these Standards supersede all prior agreements or representations, oral or written, regarding such subject matter. These Standards are governed by the law governing the Agreement, except for where the applicable Standard Contractual Clauses are executed between the parties, which contain specific provisions on the applicable law in Clause IV, “Law applicable to the clauses.”

**13\. Definitions.** The following definitions apply to these Standards:

* California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA) is the California state statute that created new consumer rights relating to the access to, deletion of, and sharing of personal information of California residents which became effective on January 1, 2020, and any subsequent modifications or amendments.
* Data Protection Legislation means any applicable data protection, security, consumer protection and related regulatory and legal obligations globally, including, but not limited to, the CCPA and the GDPR, and any subsequent modifications or amendments.
* General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 is that regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data, which was enforceable as of 25 May 2018 and any subsequent modifications or amendments.
*  Legitimate Interest means that processing is permitted if it is necessary for the purposes of a legitimate interest pursued by the controller (or by a third party), except where the controller’s interests are overridden by the interests, fundamental rights, or freedoms of the affected Shoppers which require protection.
*  Sale means any activity that qualifies as “sell,” “selling,” “sale,” or “sold,” under the CCPA.
* Standard Contractual Clauses are the contractual requirements approved by a relevant authority to ensure the appropriate data protection safeguards are in place in the event of the international transfer of Personal Data.

Any claim, dispute, or controversy you may have against us arising out of, relating to, or connected with this Site or your transaction shall be resolved exclusively by binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and conducted before a single arbitrator pursuant to the applicable Rules and Procedures established by the AAA, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (as applicable) and as amended by these Terms (“Arbitration Rules and Procedures”).

The AAA’s Rules, and a form for initiating arbitration proceedings, are available on the AAA’s website located at [http://www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/)[http://www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/).

This section applies to all consumers to the fullest extent allowable by law. The disputes governed by this Section include without limitation (1) claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between you and us; (2) claims arising from your use of the Site; and (3) claims currently subject to a purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class.

However, the dispute resolution procedure specifically does not apply to (1) a claim relating to the enforcement or validity of your or our intellectual property rights; or (2) a claim relating to an allegation of theft, piracy, or unauthorised use.

You agree that: (1) the arbitrator shall apply New York law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, including principles of equity, and shall honour claims of privilege recognised by law; (2) the arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving us, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving both you and us to the extent required by applicable law; (3) in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive.

**You and we agree that (1) each of us can only bring claims against the other on an individual basis and there shall be no authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class or representative basis; (2) arbitration can decide only your and/or our individual claims, and the arbitrator may award relief only in favour of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party’s individual claim(s); and (3) the arbitrator may not consolidate or join claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated and may not otherwise preside over any form of consolidated, representative, or class proceeding.** If any section of this paragraph is determined to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable then the entirety of this Arbitration Provision shall be null and void, and neither party shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute.

Except as specified in the paragraph immediately above, if any part of this Arbitration Provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Arbitration Rules and Procedures established by the AAA, then the remaining provisions of the Arbitration Provision will not be affected and will be enforced to the fullest extent of the law.

**Governing Law and Venue**

In the event that the above Arbitration Provision does not apply to you or to a particular claim or dispute, you agree that any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and us must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in Hennepin County, Minnesota, and both you and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Hennepin County, Minnesota for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes applying the law of the state of New York, United States of America.

### Section 17: Severability

If any provision (or part of a provision) of the Terms is determined to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the validity of the remaining provisions will not be affected and will be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable law.

### Section 18: No Waiver

Any delay or failure by us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms does not constitute a waiver on our part. A waiver of any breach or default in one instance does not constitute a waiver of any breach or default in a subsequent breach or default. No waiver by us will be effective unless it is in writing and signed by us.

**Guarantees**

Under EU law and related member state law, subject to the exceptions outlined below, all products you purchase from the Site are protected by a 2-year guarantee that the products conform to the contract.

* Is fit for the purpose for which you require it if you have made that purpose known to us prior to the conclusion of the contract;
* Is fit for the usual purposes of goods of the same type; and
* Shows the quality and purpose for which goods of the same type and which you, as a consumer, can reasonably expect given the nature of the product, taking into account any statements made by us or the manufacturer or its representative, particularly in advertising or labelling.

A product does not lack conformity if you were aware (should have been aware) of the lack of conformity at the time the contract was concluded. A product does not lack conformity if the lack of conformity is a result of materials supplied by you.

If a product does not conform to the contract, you have the right to (1) ask us to bring the goods into conformity free of charge by either repairing or replacing the product; (2) a price reduction; or (3) rescind the contract with regards to any non-conforming goods. You may not be entitled to repair or replacement if repair or replacement is impossible or the cost disproportionate to the cost of an alternative remedy.

If you are a consumer in the following countries, the following time periods apply to your purchase:

* _Finland_ – the duration of the guarantee is based on the expected lifespan.
* _Iceland_ – the duration of the guarantee is normally 2 years and 5 years for goods expected to have a longer lifespan.

General Terms and Conditions

**1\. General Terms and Conditions.**

**1.1            These Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) Govern our Solution.**  WHEN YOU SIGN AN ORDER FORM WITH US, OR CONTINUE TO USE OUR SOLUTION AFTER THE “LAST UDPATED” DATE OF THESE TERMS, YOU ARE AGREEING TO THESE TERMS ON BEHALF OF YOUR ORGANIZATION.  These Terms refer to Digital River as “us,” “we,” or “our” and  to your business organization as “you” or “your”. For purposes of these Terms, we refer to the sale of a license to digital product(s) and the sale of a service use right to services as a “sale” of a “product,” even though digital product(s) and services are licensed and not sold.

**1.2            Our Solution; Appointment of Digital River as Reseller.**  Digital River’s product is a fully-integrated suite of back-end services – payments, tax, fraud and compliance – called Global Seller Services (“**GSS**”).  GSS is enabled by our business model, where we act as an online reseller of your products. When you use our Solution to sell your products, you appoint Digital River, and Digital River accepts the appointment, to resell your products to shoppers.

**1.3            Applicable Terms**. Use of the Solution is governed by these Terms, the below Service Level Agreement, Data Handling Standards, Guidelines and Best Practices, and mutually approved Order Form (collectively the “**Agreement**”).  The Order Form is the only portion of the Agreement you will sign.

**1.4            Your Business and Shopper Experience.**  You are fully responsible for all aspects of your business and shopper experiences, including:  (i) your website and online shopping experience; (ii) your online order capture experience (to the extent we are not directly providing the capture experience for you); (iii) your products and services; (iv) shopper relations, including support service for any installation, use, configuration and operation of your products and services; (v) your systems or the systems you procure from third parties, including any downtime, errors or fraud on such systems; (vi) your personnel; and (vii) your compliance with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to your responsibilities.

**1.6            Information You Provide.** Our Solution is dependent upon the information you provide to us (e.g., we must know about your products in order for our Solution to legitimately resell your products, process payments for your products, calculate any taxes due, and for our software logic to help determine if a purchase is fraudulent), so you must provide to us in a timely manner all information in your control reasonably required by us to comply with our obligations, as further addressed in the Guidelines & Best Practices. You must respond promptly to any request for direction, information, or approval that is reasonably necessary for us to deliver the Solution for you or protect our rights under the Agreement.  The information you provide must be accurate, true and complete, and if any information is or becomes materially inaccurate or incomplete, you must immediately notify us.

**1.7            Licenses.**  During the term of your use of the Solution, (i) we grant you a license to use our APIs and/or administration interface applicable to the Solution solely for your use of the Solution, and (ii) if the Solution requires either of us to use the other party’s trademarks and logos to perform or use the Solution, we each hereby grant the other party a license to do so solely as required in connection with the performance or use of the Solution under the Agreement, and only in the form and with appropriate legends as required by the other party.  You agree we may announce the relationship in a mutually approved press release within 60 days of initially entering into an Order Form with you, and you and us both agree to work together on joint marketing initiatives.

**1.8            Ownership and Intellectual Property.**  As between you and us, you own all of your Confidential Information and materials you provide to us, whether electronic or physical, in the course of performing your obligations under these Terms (including without limitation your products, trademarks and logos, as may be applicable) and all proprietary and intellectual property rights thereto.  As between us and you, we own the Solution, its constituent parts, our software, marks, logos, work product, information prepared by, provided by, or used by us (other than the materials you provide to us), and any modifications or improvements to them, and all proprietary and intellectual property rights thereto.

**1.9            Confidentiality.**  We and you each agree, as it relates to our or your respective handling of confidential information, to maintain in strict confidence and to use only to deliver or use the Solution or as otherwise authorized by the other party, all information received under the Agreement which is of a confidential nature concerning the other party’s business operations, technical and financial information, employees, suppliers, providers or shoppers (**“Confidential Information”**).  Information will not be deemed Confidential Information if it is or becomes generally available to the public without breach of the Agreement or is independently developed by the non-disclosing party or its personnel or representatives without reliance in any way on Confidential Information of the disclosing party.

In connection with our performance, tracking and improvement of the Solution we may disclose Confidential Information to our third-party providers (such as our corporate affiliates, merchant/acquiring banks and contractors) and you may disclose Confidential Information to your third-party providers to the extent necessary for your use of the Solution.

**1.10            Protection of Personal Data.** We and you each agree, as applicable, to comply with all applicable data protection and data privacy laws, rules, and regulations as they relate to our or your respective handling, control of and/or processing of personal data (or similar defined terms under applicable laws) as set forth in the Data Handling Standards.  We agree to be liable for any breach of this paragraph by our subcontractors or agents, if any are involved in performing the Solution.

**1.11            Material Change in Circumstances.**  If you are subject to a material change in circumstances (including without limitation a change in ownership, a material change in your financial condition, a material change in your products or services, or a change in the laws or regulations applicable to your business) that we believe, in good faith, is likely to cause you or us to be in violation of an applicable law, rule or regulation or which represents a material economic or liability risk to us, we may immediately, on notice to you, (i) establish and maintain an offset in an amount we in good faith specify, based on an increased risk to us of chargebacks, refunds, or penalties; (ii) institute a delay in our payments to you; (iii) suspend or limit your use of the Solution; or (iv) terminate this Agreement.

1.13.5      Following any notice of termination or non-renewal, we may create an offset from remaining payments due to you in an amount we reasonably estimate to cover potential chargebacks, refunds, or penalties that may occur following the effective date of termination (the “**Wind-down Offset**”). After termination of this Agreement, we will release portions of the Wind-down Offset monthly based on the decrease in risk exposure until the full Wind-down Offset is released, no later than one hundred and eighty (180) days following the termination of this Agreement.

**1.20            Miscellaneous.**  These Terms, the applicable Standards, including the Guidelines and Best Practices, and the relevant mutually approved Order Form constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and in the Order Form, and supersede any previous and contemporaneous agreements and understandings with respect to the subject matter hereof.  No provisions in your purchase orders or your other business forms will alter the Agreement.  Amendments may only be made by a written agreement in an Order Form executed by authorized officers of both parties and by us in accordance with Section 1.18.  If there is any conflict between the provisions in the Agreement and any mutually approved Order Form between the parties, the mutually approved Order Form will control.

**1.22            Independent Contractors.**  The parties are independent contractors, and not partners or joint venturers.  Neither party has the right, power or authority to act or create any obligation on behalf of the other party. We may engage the services of subcontractors or agents to assist us in the performance of our obligations.  Because a subcontractor (such as a payment provider) or agent may perform the same function for many or all clients, and we require flexibility to switch or alternate subcontractors and agents to ensure service level standards, pricing commitments or other obligations under this Agreement, we are unable to inform individual clients or seek approval from individual clients each time there is a change or reassignment of a subcontractor or agent; however we will be responsible for the acts and omissions of our subcontractors and agents in the performance of such obligations under the Agreement.

**1.23            Third Party Requirements.** For certain additional and optional services available through the Solution, you may be required to agree to additional appendices and/or agreements with us and/or our third-party financial institutions, processors, or card associations that contain terms and obligations specific to those services. Any third-party financial institution, processor or payment services provider is an independent third party and we are not liable for any actions or inactions of third parties, included but not limited to, a third party’s unwillingness to work with you.

**1.24            Assignment.**  Neither party may assign the Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party except in connection with a merger or sale of all or substantially all of its assets or equity, but in such event the assigning party must provide prompt written notice to the non-assigning party of the change and the non-assigning party may terminate the Agreement if the assignment is to a direct competitor of the non-assigning party.  The Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their permitted successors and assigns.

We maintain a business continuity and disaster recovery plan designed to minimize the impact to our operations of a man-made or natural disaster or other similar events which could impact our business operations and/or technology infrastructure. We annually test our ability to comply with our business continuity and disaster recovery plan and will make our results available upon request.
6. Issue Resolution. We target resolution of issues, based on their severity. In the event an issue could be classified within more than one Severity Level, we shall initially classify the issue; in addition, we may, upon notice to you, reclassify the priority level of an issue as fixes are rendered and/or developed or the severity of the issue decreases. In the event you disagree with our classification or reclassification, as appropriate, you may contact us to discuss when a further reclassification of the issue is appropriate.
    
    | Severity Level | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | Level 1 | * Impact: Critical<br>* Our Classification: Solution is down<br>* Acknowledgment: As soon as possible (dependent on circumstances)<br>* Issue Resolution: As soon as possible (dependent on circumstances) |
    | Level 2 | * Impact: High<br>* Our Classification: Disruptive problem to the Solution impacting performance or availability<br>* Acknowledgment: Within twenty-four (24) hours<br>* Issue Resolution: As soon as possible (dependent on circumstances) |
    | Level 3 | * Impact: Medium<br>* Our Classification: Some impact to the Solution; however, not vital to immediate performance or availability<br>* Acknowledgment: Within two (2) business days<br>* Issue Resolution: Within 5-10 business days of Acknowledgment, unless notified otherwise |
    | Level 4 | * Impact: Low<br>* Our Classification: Minimal impact to the Solution<br>* Acknowledgment: Within two (2) business days<br>* Issue Resolution: We will evaluate and incorporate into maintenance release as we deem appropriate |
    
    For the purposes of this table, the “Acknowledgment” is the time from when we first learn of a problem to when we initially contact to you by email or telephone acknowledging such reported issue; and “Issue Resolution” is when we substantially resolve the issue or begin a plan to resolve the issue, whichever occurs first.
    
7. Remedies. If we fail to meet our availability commitment in any calendar quarter during which we were compensated for your use of the Solution, your sole and exclusive remedy is a service level credit as follows, subject to your rights in case of a continuous failure as described in section 8 below. The service level credit is calculated by applying the service credit percentage to the charges we earned and received less the cost of payment processing for transactions we processed during that calendar quarter for your use of the Solution. We will apply any service credits only against future Solution charges otherwise due from you. Service credits will not entitle you to any refund or other payment from us. Subject to section 8 below, the foregoing is your sole and exclusive remedy for our breach.
    
    | Quarterly Uptime Percentage | Service Credit Percentage |
    | --- | --- |
    | Less than 99.9% but greater than or equal to 99.0% | 10% |
    | Less than 99.0% but greater than or equal to 95.0% | 25% |
    | Less than 95.0% | 50% |
    
    1. Remedy Procedure. To receive a service credit, you must submit a claim by opening a case with our Customer Success Team. To be eligible, we must receive your credit request within 30 days’ after the end of the calendar quarter in which the service level commitment was not met and must include:
        
        1. the words “SLA Credit Request – Solution” in the subject line;
        2. the dates and times of each period of unavailability that you are claiming;
        3. the calendar quarter with respect to which you are claiming service credits;
        4. Your request logs that document the errors and corroborate your claimed outage (any confidential or sensitive information in the logs should be removed or replaced with asterisks).
        
        If we confirm the Quarterly Uptime Percentage is less than our service commitment, then we will issue you a service credit within one billing cycle following the quarter in which we confirm your request. If you don’t provide your request and other information needed above, you will be disqualified from receiving a service credit.
        
8. Alternative Remedy in Case of Continuous Failure. Should we fail to meet our availability commitment in any two (2) consecutive calendar quarters during which we were compensated for your use of the Solution, you shall, as an alternative remedy, be entitled to terminate the Agreement upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to us. For the avoidance of doubts, in case you decide to terminate the Agreement based on this provision you shall not be entitled to receive additional service credits for the calendar quarter giving rise to such termination right.In the event you fail to provide us with notice of such termination within forty-five (45) calendar days of the end of the calendar quarter giving rise to such termination right, you shall be deemed to have waived its right to terminate the Agreement for such failure (but shall have the right to so terminate if the condition is met in any subsequent two (2) calendar quarters).

### Data Handling Standards

**Data Handling Standards**

Effective as of August 12, 2022

These Standards are in addition to the terms in the Agreement. Words used in these Standards with an initial capital letter have the same meaning (i) as defined in these standards in Section 13 “Definitions;” (ii) as found in the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR); (iii) as found in the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA); or (iv) as found in the Agreement. Where a term in these Standards conflicts with a corresponding term in the Agreement, the term in these Standards will control with respect to the parties’ obligations under these Standards.

**1\. Background and Purpose.** Each party is responsible for privacy, data security, and compliance with any global Data Protection Legislation that may apply to your commerce solution. These Standards were created to allow us to have an open data sharing arrangement with you. The purpose is to ensure that any transfers of data between the parties are completed using appropriate safeguards, and that each party understands its obligations under Data Protection Legislation. Here, we have laid out the obligations of each party, including our respective responsibilities under Data Protection Legislation.

**2\. Obligations of the Parties.** You and we will each maintain the responsibility of being an (Independent) Data Controller for Personal Data. As such, each party is responsible for ensuring that Personal Data is Processed according to Data Protection Legislation and that there is a lawful basis for its Processing activities.

**3\. Description of Personal Data and Purpose of Processing.** Each party will process Personal Data of those purchasers that purchase a title, license right, and/or usage right to a product using our Service (the “Shopper”). Those categories of Personal Data may include names, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, IP addresses, and other related transaction information.

The Personal Data will be processed independently by each party for the following purposes:

*  To provide the Shoppers with the services they have requested, in accordance with the relevant party’s privacy policy,
* To ensure the performance of the parties’ obligations under the Agreement,
*  To provide other similar services to Shoppers where the Shoppers have, if applicable, consented to such services, and as decided by each party as its own (Independent) Data Controller,
*  To share the data with third parties, Service Providers, and use Processors to process the data so long as the parties comply with Data Protection Legislation; and
* Digital River agrees that it will only independently process the Shopper Personal Data for the following purposes: performing its obligations under the Agreement, fulfilling Shopper transactions, collecting Shopper payments, conducting fraud screening, providing support to Shoppers, preventing, detecting, or investigating fraud, employing independent fraud modeling, detection, and risk analytics, payment optimization, and generally complying with its contractual or other obligations to the Shopper and complying with its legal obligations. For clarity, DR will not process Shopper Personal Data to market to end users.

For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that neither party receives valuable consideration for, and no Sale has occurred as a result of the transfer of data from one party to another. Any transfer of data between the parties is done for the purpose of fulfilling and processing shopper-initiated transactions and for providing related support.

**4\. Information Provided to Shoppers.** The parties agree to include the applicable link to each party’s privacy policy, prior to the collection by such party, of the Shopper’s Personal Data, so that it is clear to the Shopper which privacy policy applies to the processing of their data. For the avoidance of doubt, your privacy policy will govern how you will process Personal Data and ours will govern how we will process Personal Data. We are each responsible for fulfilling our promises as outlined in our respective privacy policies.  
Where applicable, you will gather and document the applicable consents from Shoppers for the processing of their data, such as for marketing activities. And, where there is another lawful basis for the processing (such as “Legitimate Interests”) you will also document the applicable lawful basis and your reasoning behind such decision(s).

**5\. Data Handling Requests; Notifying the Other party.** Data Protection Legislation, such as GDPR and CCPA, grants Shoppers certain rights regarding their personal data that a Data Controller holds and obligates Data Controllers to facilitate the exercise of those rights. As such, each party is responsible for facilitating the exercise of Shoppers’ rights under applicable law and must send any applicable data handling requests to the other party without undue delay.

Such rights may include the right to consent, and to withdraw the consent, the right of access, rectification, restriction of Processing, erasure, data portability, and the right to object to Processing. It is up to each party to ensure the Shoppers’ rights are honored as appropriate, considering applicable legal requirements. It is also each party’s responsibility to ensure that the Shopper has been appropriately authenticated under Data Protection Legislation prior to acting on any access request.

Specifically, as it relates to data erasure requests from a Shopper, we request that you log into our administration interface software (or successor user interface) and click on the “Request Removal of Personal Information” button, which will automatically trigger a notification to us. You may also send any communications related to such data handling requests to the Digital River contact point(s) noted in the Order Form under “Privacy.”

**6\. Security of Personal Data.** Each party agrees to take reasonable steps to provide a level of security appropriate to the sensitivity of the Personal Data in each party’s control.

*  Each party represents, warrants and covenants to the other party that (i) it has implemented technical and organizational security measures, which meet industry standards and comply with all applicable Data Protection Legislation, to prevent any unauthorized access, use or disclosure of Personal Data, and (ii) its processing of Personal Data will at all times be performed in accordance with such technical and organizational security measures; and
*  Each Party represents and warrants that it has in place and in writing a business continuity and disaster recovery plan; and
* To the extent required by applicable law, the parties will not transfer the Personal Data to a processor, vendor, service provider, subcontractor or sub-processor (a “Processor”), unless (i) it has first concluded a written agreement with the Processor that imposes obligations and restrictions on the third-party at least as restrictive as those that apply to the other party under these Standards (“Processing Agreements”), and (ii) such transfer complies with applicable Data Protection Legislation; and
* The party who has transferred Personal Data to the Processor shall be liable for the acts or omissions of that Processor with respect to Personal Data.

**7\. Security Breach.** With respect to any Security Breach, the parties will take all steps reasonably necessary to (i) investigate and remediate the effects of such occurrence, (ii) mitigate any harm to those Shoppers that are affected or could be affected by such occurrence, (iii) prevent the re-occurrence, and (iv) comply with applicable Data Protection Legislation.

Each party shall notify the other party in writing or by phone (for Digital River, the phone number is 952-253-1234, attention: Legal) after becoming aware of any compromise of the Personal Data that may affect the other party. The responsible party shall also notify the Supervisory Authority and Shoppers, where required and within the applicable time period under Data Protection Legislation. As such, the parties will coordinate with, consult with and keep the other party regularly informed related to its response to any Security Breach.

**8\. Transfers of Personal Data Outside of the EEA or United Kingdom.** A party shall not transfer Personal Data (nor permit any Personal Data to be transferred) to a territory outside of the EEA or the United Kingdom unless it has taken such measures as are necessary to ensure the transfer complies with applicable law. The parties acknowledge that adequate protection for the Personal Data must exist for any transfer and will, if needed, enter into an appropriate written agreement governing such transfer of Personal Data, including, but not limited to Standard Contractual Clauses, taking into account the level of protection of the third country and taking additional steps to guarantee protection, if necessary, unless another appropriate safeguard for the transfer exists.

To the extent that that the Agreement involves the transfer of Personal Data outside of the EEA or United Kingdom, the parties agree that Standard Contractual Clauses shall be incorporated into the Agreement. To that end, for agreements entered into on or after September 27, 2021 the Standard Contractual Clauses applicable to the transfer of Personal Data outside of the EEA [EU Standard Contractual Clauses](https://preprod.drstaging.com/legal-other/eu-standard-contractual-clauses-commerce-connector-solutions/) (https://preprod.drstaging.com/legal-other/eu-standard-contractual-clauses-commerce-connector-solutions/), plus the relevant Privacy Details in the Order Form shall constitute the completed EU Standard Contractual Clauses, and the International Data Transfer Agreement applicable to the transfer of Personal Data outside of the [UK Standard Contractual Clauses](https://www.digitalriver.com/legal-other/uk-standard-contractual-clauses-commerce-connector-solutions/)  (https://preprod.drstaging.com/legal-other/uk-standard-contractual-clauses-commerce-connector-solutions/), plus the relevant Privacy Details in the Order Form shall constitute the completed UK Standard Contractual Clauses. For agreements entered into prior to September 27, 2021, the contractual requirements for the transfer of Personal Data to Controllers established in third countries found in the European Commission’s Decision 2004/915/EC of 27 December 2004 plus the Privacy details in the Order form shall constitute completed Standard Contractual Clauses and shall remain in full force and effect until the Parties enter into an amendment adopting new Standard Contractual Clauses. Where and to the extent Standard Contractual Clauses apply pursuant to this Clause, if there is any conflict between these Standards and the Standard Contractual Clauses, the Standard Contractual Clauses shall prevail.

**9\. Liabilities and Indemnification.** Each party agrees to be held solely liable for the performance of its obligations under Data Protection Legislation and these Standards, and any costs associated with a party’s failure to comply with Data Protection Legislation and these Standards, including any fines imposed by a Supervisory Authority (or its equivalent), shall be paid by the party that failed to comply.  
While nothing in the Agreement or these Standards shall be construed as making the parties, acting as (Independent) Data Controllers, involved in the same processing, should, pursuant to Article 82(4) of the GDPR, a party be found to be liable for the entire damage arising from a breach or breaches of the GDPR relating to activities under these Standards, in order to ensure effective compensation of one or more individuals, then that party shall indemnify the other party for that portion of the compensation attributable to any breaches of the GDPR for which it is responsible.

**10\. Requests from Supervisory Authorities.** The parties agree to cooperate with each other when they receive a request from a Supervisory Authority or court of law that impacts the other party. Where one party receives the request (the “Receiving Party”), the Receiving Party shall communicate the request to the other party promptly, and where possible, prior to responding to the Supervisory Authority or court of law. However, if this is not possible due to the immediacy of the request, the Receiving Party shall communicate the request to the other party as soon as reasonably possible after submission of the response.

**11\. Survival of these Standards.** Regardless of whether the Agreement is terminated or expires, if either party has access to, processes or otherwise retains Personal Data, the parties agree to comply with all applicable requirements under Data Protection Legislation. Therefore, the applicable sections of these Standards that relate to the parties’ obligations under Data Protection Legislation, survives any termination or expiration of the Agreement. To the extent there are no further obligations of the parties under Data Protection Legislation, these Standards will terminate. Also, and for the avoidance of doubt, each party is responsible for destroying the Personal Data in accordance with applicable laws and neither party is required to return to the other party the Personal Data that is in their possession.

**12\. Applicable Law and Dispute Resolution.** These Standards (including the Agreement) constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and these Standards supersede all prior agreements or representations, oral or written, regarding such subject matter. These Standards are governed by the law governing the Agreement, except for where the applicable Standard Contractual Clauses are executed between the parties, which contain specific provisions on the applicable law in Clause IV, “Law applicable to the clauses.”

**13\. Definitions.** The following definitions apply to these Standards:

* California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA) is the California state statute that created new consumer rights relating to the access to, deletion of, and sharing of personal information of California residents which became effective on January 1, 2020, and any subsequent modifications or amendments.
* Data Protection Legislation means any applicable data protection, security, consumer protection and related regulatory and legal obligations globally, including, but not limited to, the CCPA and the GDPR, and any subsequent modifications or amendments.
* General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 is that regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data, which was enforceable as of 25 May 2018 and any subsequent modifications or amendments.
*  Legitimate Interest means that processing is permitted if it is necessary for the purposes of a legitimate interest pursued by the controller (or by a third party), except where the controller’s interests are overridden by the interests, fundamental rights, or freedoms of the affected Shoppers which require protection.
*  Sale means any activity that qualifies as “sell,” “selling,” “sale,” or “sold,” under the CCPA.
* Standard Contractual Clauses are the contractual requirements approved by a relevant authority to ensure the appropriate data protection safeguards are in place in the event of the international transfer of Personal Data.

**To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, in no event and under no legal basis will Digital River, its suppliers, or licensors be liable to you or any third party for any damages, costs, or liabilities arising from or related to the purchase or use of any products or services or these terms, including, without limitation, any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or special damages (e.g. damages for expense or business interruption, property damage, attorneys’ fees, lost profits, lost use, revenue, goodwill, or value of assets or securities) even if Digital River has been advised or is otherwise aware of the possibility of such damages. Digital River’s total aggregate liability arising out of or related to the purchase and sale of a product or services is limited to the amount you paid to Digital River for such product or service.**

**The above limitations of liability form the fundamental basis of the bargain between you and Digital River. The above cap on liability will not apply to liability for Digital River for (a) death, personal injury, or property damage directly or indirectly caused by the item you purchased from Digital River; or (b) damages caused by Digital River’s fraud, fraudulent misrepresentations, intentional misconduct, gross negligence, or any other matters for which liability cannot be excluded or limited under applicable law.**

**Nothing in this section limits or excludes liability that cannot be limited or excluded under applicable law.**

### Section 15: Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold Digital River, our parent, and each of our officers, employees, agents, partners, content providers, service providers, suppliers, and licensors (collectively “Released Parties”) harmless from any and all claims, liabilities, costs, losses, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising from (1) your purchase of products and services made available through this Site; and (2) your fraudulent or deceptive acts or omissions, or breach or violation of law, including infringement of any IP claim or breach of these Terms.

### Section 16: Dispute Resolution

We hope that you are completely satisfied with the purchase of your product or service. We will make every reasonable effort to resolve any disputes you may have with us. However, if we are unable to resolve any dispute that arises in connection with your transaction, this Site, or these Terms to your satisfaction, this section governs the dispute resolution process.

For shoppers outside of the United States, special terms may apply to your right to Dispute Resolution. Please see the [Local International Terms](#_Local_International_Terms) section below.

**Arbitration Provision**

Any claim, dispute, or controversy you may have against us arising out of, relating to, or connected with this Site or your transaction shall be resolved exclusively by binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and conducted before a single arbitrator pursuant to the applicable Rules and Procedures established by the AAA, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (as applicable) and as amended by these Terms (“Arbitration Rules and Procedures”).

The AAA’s Rules, and a form for initiating arbitration proceedings, are available on the AAA’s website located at [http://www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/)[http://www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/).

This section applies to all consumers to the fullest extent allowable by law. The disputes governed by this Section include without limitation (1) claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between you and us; (2) claims arising from your use of the Site; and (3) claims currently subject to a purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class.

However, the dispute resolution procedure specifically does not apply to (1) a claim relating to the enforcement or validity of your or our intellectual property rights; or (2) a claim relating to an allegation of theft, piracy, or unauthorised use.

You agree that: (1) the arbitrator shall apply New York law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, including principles of equity, and shall honour claims of privilege recognised by law; (2) the arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving us, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving both you and us to the extent required by applicable law; (3) in the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive.

**You and we agree that (1) each of us can only bring claims against the other on an individual basis and there shall be no authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class or representative basis; (2) arbitration can decide only your and/or our individual claims, and the arbitrator may award relief only in favour of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party’s individual claim(s); and (3) the arbitrator may not consolidate or join claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated and may not otherwise preside over any form of consolidated, representative, or class proceeding.** If any section of this paragraph is determined to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable then the entirety of this Arbitration Provision shall be null and void, and neither party shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute.

Except as specified in the paragraph immediately above, if any part of this Arbitration Provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Arbitration Rules and Procedures established by the AAA, then the remaining provisions of the Arbitration Provision will not be affected and will be enforced to the fullest extent of the law.

**Governing Law and Venue**

In the event that the above Arbitration Provision does not apply to you or to a particular claim or dispute, you agree that any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and us must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in Hennepin County, Minnesota, and both you and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Hennepin County, Minnesota for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes applying the law of the state of New York, United States of America.

### Section 17: Severability

If any provision (or part of a provision) of the Terms is determined to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the validity of the remaining provisions will not be affected and will be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable law.

### Section 18: No Waiver

Any delay or failure by us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms does not constitute a waiver on our part. A waiver of any breach or default in one instance does not constitute a waiver of any breach or default in a subsequent breach or default. No waiver by us will be effective unless it is in writing and signed by us.

Local International Terms
-------------------------

To our shoppers outside of the United States, the terms set forth below in this Local International Terms section are additional and supplemental to the Terms above. Where a provision within this section is inconsistent with the general terms outlined above, the terms specific to your jurisdiction will apply to your purchase

### European Union, England, and Wales

**Right to Withdrawal**

If you are a consumer, in addition to any returns policy associated with your sale, you have a right to withdraw from (or cancel) this contract within 14 calendar days without giving a reason.

In the case of a service or digital content, your right to withdrawal expires 14 days from the conclusion of the contract.

In the case of goods, your right to withdrawal expires 14 days after the day on which you, or a third party indicated by you (other than a carrier) takes physical possession of the goods or:

* In the case of multiple goods on one order and delivered separately, the day on which you, or a third party indicated by you, takes physical possession of the last good;
* In the case of a good consisting of multiple lots or pieces, the day on which you, or a third party indicated by you, takes possession of the last lot or piece;
* In the case of a contract for regular delivery of goods during a defined period, the day on which you, or a third party indicated by you, takes physical possession of the first good.

**_Consequences of Withdrawal_**

If you withdraw from this contract, we will refund all payments we received from you — including delivery costs (except for additional costs where you choose a shipping method faster than the least expensive delivery method) — no later than 14 days from the day on which we receive your notification of withdrawal. Unless you have expressly agreed otherwise, we will refund your payment using the same method of payment you used in the original transaction. In any event, you will not incur a handling or cancellation fee as a result of your refund.

You must return any good to us immediately, and in any event no more than 14 days from the date on which you inform us of your withdrawal from this contract. This deadline is met if you send us the goods before the expiration of this 14-day period. You bear the direct costs of returning the goods to us. You must take necessary precautions to preserve the goods and you must pay us for any loss in value in the goods that is directly attributable to your mistreatment or mishandling of the goods upon examination of their quality, characteristics, and functionality. We may refuse to issue a refund until we have received the goods back or until you have provided proof of their return.

**_Loss of Right to Withdrawal with Digital Goods_**

Where this contract involves the delivery of digital content not supplied in a physical medium, your right of withdrawal expires where (1) you expressly agree performance of the contract will begin prior to the expiration of the 14-day withdrawal period and (2) you acknowledge that you will lose your right to withdrawal if performance of the contract begins prior to the expiration of the 14-day withdrawal period.

**_No Right to Withdrawal_**

For any contract that involves delivery of sound recordings, video recordings, or computer software in a sealed package, you lose your right to withdrawal if the seal is removed or broken after delivery.

You have no right of withdrawal where the contract involves delivery of goods that are made to your specifications or are clearly personalised.

**Exercising your Right to Withdrawal**

If you wish to exercise your right to withdrawal, please notify us of your decision to withdraw by post or email.

Digital River Ireland, Ltd

Dromore House, East Park,

Shannon Co. Clare, Ireland

[cancellation\_eu@digitalriver.com](mailto:cancellation_eu@digitalriver.com)[cancellation\_eu@digitalriver.com](mailto:cancellation_eu@digitalriver.com)

You are not required to use a particular format to exercise this right; any unequivocal statement that you are exercising your right to withdrawal is enough.

You may also exercise you right by using the online form available at this link: [Cancellation Form](https://www.findmyorder.com/store/findmyor/en_GB/DisplayRightOfWithdrawalPage).

Regardless of how you contact us, you must send your notice of withdrawal before the cancellation period expires.

**Guarantees**

Under EU law and related member state law, subject to the exceptions outlined below, all products you purchase from the Site are protected by a 2-year guarantee that the products conform to the contract.

A product conforms to the contract if it:

* Complies with the description we provided to you prior to the conclusion of the contract;
* Is fit for the purpose for which you require it if you have made that purpose known to us prior to the conclusion of the contract;
* Is fit for the usual purposes of goods of the same type; and
* Shows the quality and purpose for which goods of the same type and which you, as a consumer, can reasonably expect given the nature of the product, taking into account any statements made by us or the manufacturer or its representative, particularly in advertising or labelling.

A product does not lack conformity if you were aware (should have been aware) of the lack of conformity at the time the contract was concluded. A product does not lack conformity if the lack of conformity is a result of materials supplied by you.

If a product does not conform to the contract, you have the right to (1) ask us to bring the goods into conformity free of charge by either repairing or replacing the product; (2) a price reduction; or (3) rescind the contract with regards to any non-conforming goods. You may not be entitled to repair or replacement if repair or replacement is impossible or the cost disproportionate to the cost of an alternative remedy.

If you are a consumer in the following countries, the following time periods apply to your purchase:

* _Finland_ – the duration of the guarantee is based on the expected lifespan.
* _Iceland_ – the duration of the guarantee is normally 2 years and 5 years for goods expected to have a longer lifespan.
* _Ireland_ – you must exercise your rights within the 6-year limitation period.
* _Netherlands_ – the duration of the guarantee period is based on the expected lifespan of the goods.
* _Norway_ – the duration is normally 2 years and 5 years for goods expected to have a longer lifespan.
* _Sweden_ – the duration of the guarantee is 3 years.
* _England, Wales, and Northern Ireland_ – you must exercise your rights within the 6-year limitation period.
* _Scotland_ – you must exercise your rights within the 5-year limitation period.

**Dispute Resolution**

Subject to any mandatory local law, these Terms shall be governed by English Law and we both agree to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the English Courts of London over the Terms and any other matter related to them, and all proceedings shall be conducted in English.
