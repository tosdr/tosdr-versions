**Digital River’s Commitment to Privacy**
=========================================

**Effective:** September 13, 2021

Digital River, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively “Digital River”, “we”, and “us”) is a world-class online global reseller services provider. We provide essential compliance, fraud, tax and payment services to the supplier or manufacturer (“Supplier”) whose name appears on the website or commerce solution where this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) appears (“Site”). When we make products and service rights (“services”) available for sale through the Site, we do so as an authorised reseller on behalf of our Supplier.

We are committed to earning and keeping your trust, while giving you control over the information that is personal to you. Being accountable to you is a responsibility we take seriously. Our commitment to privacy, including processing and protecting personal data, is demonstrated in this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy").

This Privacy Policy applies to our processing of personal information collected from the Site where this Privacy Policy appears.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to our Supplier’s use of information nor does it apply to information collected by other third parties.  Please carefully review each privacy policy posted on each Site you visit.

Information We Collect

When you place an order from or otherwise use the Site, we collect the following types of information:

### Information You Manually Provide

In the process of placing an order on the Site, you provide information required to complete your transaction, validate your identity, confirm compliance with regulations related to the purchase, and complete the transaction. This may include information such as address, credit card data, or stored wallet billing information. This information is provided to us under the conditions established in this Privacy Policy and the privacy policy of our Supplier. In addition to transactional information, you may provide additional information when seeking support for your purchase or other services from us, such as when you use customer service or download or register products. We may also collect information you provide to us if you enter a competition or promotion, or sign up to receive newsletters or related services.  We may also collect information when you apply for a job or otherwise submit employment data to us.

### Special Categories of Data

Generally, we do not collect or process Special Categories of Data. However, a situation could arise (such as for employment purposes) in which we may process such data. In this case, we will be sure to comply with applicable data protection legislation and apply the necessary legal basis for processing data (e.g. processing health data for an insurance contract). We shall use reasonable security practices and procedures to safeguard your Special Categories of Data.

### Information from Your Browser or Device

We may also receive information from your web browser. This may include information that does not identify you personally (such as the date and time of your visit). The information we receive depends on the settings on your web browser. Unless prohibited by law, creating a user identity during a visit to the Site constitutes your consent for processing of your Personal Data, and we may link the information your browser provides to information that identifies you personally, as described below. Please consult your browser’s help function to find out how to change the settings. We may also collect limited Personal Data (email address) through web technologies in connection with your use of the Site, as described below.

### Geolocation Information

When you use a smart phone, mobile device or computer to access the Site or use our mobile application, we may collect information about your physical location. We may combine this information with other location-based information (e.g., your IP address and billing/postal code), to provide you with other services on your mobile device. We only share your location information with third parties that help us provide you with services. You can opt out of sharing this information by changing the permissions in your mobile device.

### Cookies and Other Similar Technologies

The information we collect using cookies and similar technologies is not typically personally identifiable, but we may link it to Personal Data that you provide. We use cookies and other similar technologies to collect information and support certain features of the Site. As the Internet evolves, we may use different types of technologies for this purpose. For example, we may use these technologies to collect information about how visitors use the Site (such as which pages they visit and the links they use). We analyse this information to better understand our visitors' interests and needs, and to improve the content and functionality of the Site. We may also use the information to support Site features to avoid asking you to re-enter information we already possess. We also use this information to personalise your experience when you use the Site and to improve marketing efforts, including through use of targeted advertising.

If you do not wish to receive cookies, you may set your browser to reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer. Although you are not required to accept cookies, you may be unable to use all of the Site's functions if your browser rejects our cookies.

For more about our use of cookies and similar technologies, refer to our [cookies statement](https://store.digitalriver.com/DRHM/store?Action=DisplayDRCookiesPolicyPage&SiteID=defaults&Locale=en_GB&ThemeID=22100&Env=BASE&eCommerceProvider=).

### Third Party Cookies and Other Similar Technologies

Web technologies may also be placed on the Site by third party providers. Also, we or third party providers may use web technologies on behalf of the Supplier whose branding appears on the Site or its service providers. This means our Supplier would be allowed to use the data collected. This information is used to enhance your experience with the Site, for marketing analysis, for targeted and display advertising, and for quality improvement. We may collect your IP address through web technologies.

We and our Suppliers may use third party service providers in connection with the Site, which may include but are not limited to: Alexa Metrics, Google Analytics, Omniture, and ClickTale. These and other service providers may collect information about your visits to websites, your interaction with websites, and the products and services offered by us or our Suppliers. Their collection and use of information are subject to their own privacy policies.

For more information regarding these third party services and how to opt out, please visit [www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt\_out.asp](http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp), [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices), or [https://www.youronlinechoices.com/](https://www.youronlinechoices.com/) (in the EU and UK).

### Information from Third Parties

We may also receive certain information about you from third parties, such as through your use of a social network authentication to sign in to the Site, your use of an authenticated payment method, or through other online data sources, according to the rules of the use and processing of such information established by the respective source. If any Personal Data are freely available or accessible in the public domain, we will not have any obligations to you regarding the same.

Our Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data

In certain jurisdictions, the processing of your Personal Data is lawful only if it is permitted under data protection legislation.

We may process your Personal Data to market to and contact you or to start a conversation using data collected from public sources. We may also, in compliance with applicable law, process your data based on legitimate interest in the employment context.

### In connection with a Sale, Merger or Related Event

If one of our corporate affiliates or a third party has acquired our business, specific assets or the business of one of our operating divisions (such as part of a sale, merger, reorganisation, or similar event), your Personal Data will become owned by that company, unless otherwise provided for by local legislation. In that event, the acquiring company's use of your Personal Data will be subject to the governing Privacy Policy, any applicable supplemental privacy notices, and the privacy preferences you have expressed to Digital River prior to merger.

### Aggregated or De-Identified Data

We may use or share information that has been aggregated or de-identified so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify an individual. We may use or share this information in several ways, including for fraud prevention services or for analytical purposes.

How We Protect Your Information

We will process your Personal Data on secure, cloud-based computer servers. Your commerce transaction will be optimally processed in or near the region from which you initiated your session. This means that the processing of your Personal Data will take place in either the United States and/or Ireland.  A copy and/or back-up of your Personal Data may be stored and otherwise processed in our cloud service provider in Ireland in accordance with Digital River’s disaster recovery program.

No method of transmitting or storing data is completely secure, however, we take reasonable steps to provide a level of security appropriate to the sensitivity of the information we collect. We have implemented physical, technical, and administrative security practices and safeguards reasonably designed to protect your Personal Data from unauthorised access and disclosure. When we collect or transmit sensitive information such as a financial account number, we use industry standard methods to protect that information as required by applicable laws. Although we use reasonable measures to protect your information, we cannot guarantee the security of information provided over the Internet or stored in our databases. You are also responsible for taking reasonable steps to protect your information against unauthorised disclosure or misuse, for example, by protecting your password and signing off when you finish using a shared computer or mobile device. We leverage industry best practices to mitigate potential compromises. If the Personal Data under the custody of Digital River is (or is likely to be) divulged, damaged or lost, we will immediately take remedial measures, inform you, if impacted, in a timely manner and report to the competent government agencies as required by applicable laws.

Your Rights to Access and Control Your Personal Data

We respect your right to make choices about the ways we collect, use, and share your Personal Data.

Accessing Your Data. If you would like to review, correct, restrict the processing of, object to direct marketing, or request erasure of your Personal Data, please send us a request using the information in the "How to Contact Us" section of this Privacy Policy. Editing and Deleting Data. if there is any error in the Personal Data that you have submitted to us or if you would like to request erasure or deletion of your Personal Data, please contact us using the information in the “How to Contact Us” section of this Privacy Policy and we will take appropriate measures. Objecting to Data Use. You have the right to object to our processing of Personal Data for direct marketing purposes. We do not sell your Personal data, nor will we use it for Direct Marketing purposes without your consent. If you contact us, we may ask you for additional information to verify your identity. We reserve the right to limit or deny your request if you have failed to provide enough information to verify your identity or to satisfy our legal and business requirements as noted in our data retention policy. When we delete your Personal Data or Special Categories of Data, it will be disposed of in a manner that prevents loss, theft, misuse, or unauthorised access in line with our data retention policy. You have the right to report to your local Supervisory Authority if you believe your rights under data protection legislation have not been appropriately considered. However, before doing so, please contact us directly as we are committed to working with you to help resolve any concerns about your privacy.

Data Retention Policy

Digital River may retain your Personal Data and transactional data for as long as you continue to use the Site, and thereafter as permitted or required by applicable law or to satisfy our business requirements.

Do Not Track Requests

If you opt out of having your information collected through cookies and other web technologies, your existing display advertising cookie(s) will be deleted and a new cookie will attempt to be placed to instruct service providers not to track your future activities when that cookie is detected (a "no-track" cookie). If your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit our opt-out page, a "no-track" cookie cannot be set on your computer. Also, if you subsequently erase "no-track" cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, you will need to opt out again. We currently do not respond to browser "no-track" signals.

Children's Privacy Policy

Digital River’s services are not directed at nor targeted towards children. If you have not reached the age of majority or are not able to enter into legally binding agreements in your country, you may not use the Site unless necessary parental consent has been obtained. If you believe that we have received information from a person protected under child protection laws where necessary parental consent was not obtained, please notify us immediately, and we will take reasonable steps to securely remove such information.

Failure to Provide Personal Data or Grant Consent When Requested

Where we are required to collect Personal Data under law or in order to perform our contract with you and you fail to provide us with such data when requested, we may not be able to perform our contract with you. Consequently, we may not be able to provide you with the products and/or services you requested.  For example, if you fail to provide your address information or if you fail to check the box agreeing to our Terms of Sale and Privacy Policy, we may not be able to complete your order.

We may also use that users' geographic location and company data. In some circumstances, for account-based marketing, this could include "likes" that we find in the public domain.

We rely on automated processing in our fraud monitoring tools to help us reduce the amount of manual review necessary to review orders for fraud. We could also rely on automated processing in the context of employment and to ensure our employees are adhering to our internal security policies. You have the right to avoid any decisions based on automated data processing where they can be characterised as profiling. However, we will not be able to process your transaction without using our fraud monitoring tools.

Privacy Policy for Californian Residents

### Your Rights

In addition to the above, California residents have the right to make the following requests with respect to their personal information under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”):

**Data Access and Portability.** You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about the personal information we have collected, used, disclosed, or sold about you in the previous 12 months.

**Deletion.** You can request that we delete the personal information we have collected from you to the extent required under the CCPA.

**Disclosure.** You have the right to request that we disclose certain information about our collection and use of your Personal Information over the last twelve (12) months, including:

* the categories of personal information we collected about you,
* the categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you,
* our business or commercial purpose for collecting such personal information,
* the categories of third parties with whom we share such personal information,
* the specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (also called a data portability request).
* where there has been disclosure for a business purpose, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained. 

To exercise any of your rights under the CCPA, please send us a request using the information in the “[Your Rights to Access and Control Your Persona Data](#_Your_Rights_to)” section of this Privacy Policy or by calling (866) 585-3251.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.  If we determine that your request warrants a fee, we will explain to you the grounds for that decision and provide you with an estimate of the cost before we complete your request.

### Our Use and sharing of your Personal Information

As discussed in more detail above, Digital River may disclose your personal information to a third party for business purposes. However, Digital River will not sell your personal information as that term is defined by the CCPA.
