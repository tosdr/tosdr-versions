Splunk Privacy Statement ("Privacy Policy")
-------------------------------------------

Updated: November 2024 

[Download PDF](https://www.splunk.com/content/dam/splunk2/en_us/pdfs/legal/privacy-policy/2024-nov-splunk-privacy-policy.pdf)

This Privacy Policy explains how Splunk LLC and its subsidiaries ("Splunk") collect, use, and disclose information you provide to us or which we otherwise collect (“Information”), including “Personal Data” by which we mean Information about an identified or reasonably identifiable individual.

This Privacy Policy applies to Offerings (as defined in the Splunk General Terms), splunk.com and to other websites Splunk operates that link to this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to Personal Data processed by Splunk as a processor or to Splunk as an employer.

From time to time, Splunk acquires companies that may operate under their own privacy policies. You will continue to be presented with those companies’ privacy policies on their offerings and websites until the integration with Splunk is complete and those offerings and websites are linked to this Privacy Policy.

The use of our Offerings is also subject to the terms of the applicable customer agreement. The use of our website is subject to the [Splunk Websites Terms and Conditions of Use](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/terms/terms-of-use.html), and the terms of this Privacy Policy are incorporated into and form part of that agreement.

Data Collection

There are two primary ways in which Splunk collects Information about you: through [Interactions](#collapseOne_1729664767) and through [Offerings](#collapseOne_1937336857) as set forth below.

Interactions

When you interact online or offline with Splunk, we may receive your Information, including your Personal Data. For example, we receive your Information when you:  
  

* Visit Splunk’s websites or offices
* Download materials through our websites
* Provide or update account or contact details through our websites
* Register for, attend, speak at or otherwise participate in Splunk-hosted or sponsored events (including, but not limited to, conferences, promotional events, webcasts, contests, or hackathons)
* Participate in community programs and Splunk-related repositories on third-party open-source platforms
* Communicate with us (including by email, phone, text, online chat, or social media)
* Provide testimonials or feedback

We collect Information about you from other sources such as public databases, commercial data sources, joint marketing partners, resellers, managed services providers and other partners, social media platforms, industry groups, and conference/event hosts.

  

We refer collectively to these contacts as “Interactions” and we explain below how we use the Information we collect through them.

What We Collect via Your Interactions

We (or others acting on our behalf) may collect your Information, including your Personal Data, through Interactions. The Personal Data we collect includes such things as:  
  

* Name or alias
* Email address
* Physical address, including country
* Employer
* Industry group participation
* Title / position
* Payment details
* Phone number
* Username / user ID
* IP address
* MAC address (or other device identifiers automatically assigned to your device when you access the internet including browser or device type)
* Images and related metadata (for example, when visiting our offices or attending an event)
* Content of your communications and files you input, upload, or create
* Videos (for example, when you provide a product testimonial)

We collect Personal Data in various ways, such as when you manually key in your Personal Data to our website forms or provide it to us or others from whom we receive marketing leads. From time to time, we offer virtual private networks (VPNs) for attendees at Splunk events or visitors to our offices. If you access a Splunk-provided VPN, we may collect Personal Data from you, such as IP and MAC addresses, when we monitor the VPNs for security or performance.  
  

IP addresses are also collected on an automated basis through your use of the website services using cookies, web beacons, and like technologies. We may infer your location from your IP address. For more on the use of cookies and like technologies, see the [Splunk Cookie Policy](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/splunk-cookie-policy.html) and [How We Use Information Collected from Interactions.](#collapseOne_2080325859)  
  

When you make purchases through our website, we use third-party payment processors to collect credit card or other financial data. Splunk does not store the credit card data you provide, only payment confirmation information.

How We Use Information Collected from Interactions

Splunk uses the Information we collect from your Interactions to deliver Offerings to you in accordance with our terms, to fulfill our contractual and legal obligations, or to pursue legitimate business interests, as described below. Here is a summary of the purposes for which we use your Information, including Personal Data, to:  
  

* Fulfill your orders or respond to your requests for information and other inquiries. For example, to satisfy your requests for website materials such as marketing collateral or white papers, we collect and use your name and email address.
* Operate, enhance, and personalize your experience on our website  
    We collect Information via cookies and other information-gathering technologies (with your consent, where required) as stated in the [Splunk Cookie Policy](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/splunk-cookie-policy.html) to fulfill our legitimate interest in operating our website, making it easy to navigate, and enriching the available content and offering information tailored to your interests. In doing so, we may receive your location Information, which you can disable by configuring the location sharing permissions in your device.
* Issue you Splunk accounts and provide you access to online communities and forums and enable your participation in, online communities and forums or to provide you with access to certain Offerings. Certain Offerings that display the Splunk name but present you with their own privacy notice are subject to such privacy notice and not this Privacy Policy.  
    When you join our online communities and forums, including blogs and Splunk-branded business communication and streaming platform channels (collectively, “Online Forums”), we collect your Personal Data to enable your access and provide an interactive experience when you participate. The guidelines associated with those Online Forums recommend not sharing private or proprietary Information on them, as many of their aspects are public. If you choose to submit content to online forums, such content will be considered public and will not be subject to the privacy protections set forth in this Privacy Policy unless expressly required by law. Online Forums that display the Splunk name but present you with their own privacy notice are subject to such privacy notice and not this Privacy Policy.
* Send you administrative notices  
    We may need to notify you (or we may choose to inform you) when we make updates to our terms or policies or make changes to our website or Offerings. We will use your name and email address to send such administrative notices to you, which due to their nature are treated differently from marketing communications from which you can opt out.
* Manage your Splunk account  
    To perform the services under the contract between you and Splunk, we need to collect certain Information from you such as your contact information and payment details. Without this Information, we may not be able to deliver the services or comply with our contractual or legal obligations.
* Advertise and market to you                                                                                                                                                                                                            With your consent or to pursue our legitimate interests as a business, we may contact you with announcements about our Offerings, educational materials, announcements about special offers, or Information about upcoming or ongoing online/offline events, such as .conf, and related offers. If required by applicable law, we will ask you for your consent before sending  such communications and/or give you the choice to opt out of receiving these communications.

* Administer prize promotions and events  
    We use your Information to administer prize promotions and events based on the terms of the promotion or event. For example, if you enter into a prize promotion, we may use your data for winner selection and to provide the prize to you, if you win. Registration for a coding workshop or other events, may require adding your name to the list of expected attendees. If selected, we may seek your consent to announce you as a winner, which you may withdraw at any time. However, we will retain Information collected in connection with your enrollment with the prize promotion or event.
* Invite you to participate on customer advisory boards or in surveys, studies, and assessments of Offerings or potential future Offerings.  
    We use your Personal Data to register you to participate on advisory boards (such as our Customer Advisory Boards, Product Advisory Councils, or Developer Advisory Boards) or to request feedback from you about our Offerings or potential future Offerings. We use your feedback to fulfill our legitimate interest in improving our current and future Offerings and growing our business. Your participation is voluntary and subject to the terms of your agreements with us and this Privacy Policy.

* Diagnose and fix technical issues, monitor for security, and otherwise protect our property  
    We do this to satisfy our legitimate interest in assessing actual or potential technical issues or threats to our facilities, attendees at Splunk-sponsored events, our IT systems and networks, Offerings, and website services. We may process your Information, in particular your IP address, for this purpose.
* Comply with law  
    We may use your Information to comply with any applicable laws, regulations, legal process, or governmental requests, or to protect our legal rights or those of others.
* For any other purpose disclosed to you in connection with our Offerings, website services, or other third-party platforms from time to time

If we process your Personal Data for other purposes, we will provide you with information about such processing, and if required, obtain your consent.

Opting Out of Marketing Emails

If you no longer want to receive marketing emails from Splunk on a go-forward basis, please submit your request through our online [opt-out form](https://privacyrequest.cisco.com/). Alternatively, you may use the "unsubscribe" feature in our marketing email messages to opt-out of receiving marketing email messages.

Offerings

We also collect Information, including Personal Data, when providing our Offerings. We may ask you for this Information directly, or in some cases, we may collect it as you use our Offerings. For example, we collect Information from or about you when you (or someone you work with):  
  

* Order or sign up for a trial of our Offerings
* Interact with Splunk online or offline, including when you request support services
* Log into or use our Offerings

What We Collect via Our Offerings

We collect and process different types of data (described below) when you deploy our Offerings  to fulfill our contractual and legal obligations, to operate our business, or fulfill other legitimate interests. The type of data we collect via our Offerings is Usage Data, which is data generated from the usage, configuration, deployment, access and performance of an Offering. We summarize for you here the types of usage data collected and the purposes for which we use this data below.

Usage Data Collected

Data about your operating environment and configuration, user interactions, and sessions related to your use of our Offerings. This may include information and related metadata about your network and systems architecture and configurations, OS and Offering versions, Offering configurations, installed applications, feature utilizations and frequencies, page loads and views, number and types of searches, errors, number of active and licensed users, source, source types and formats (e.g., json, xml, and csv), web browser details, http referrer page, and app workflows.

  

Data that allows us to identify account entitlements, such as license entitlement consumption, license capacity, or license type in our systems through an assigned license ID.

  

A combination of the above two, to provide account support including features used, deployment topology, performance metrics and license ID. The Information is user/customer-identifiable so that we can help address your specific issue and personalize your experience.  

  

If you use a mobile device to access an Offering via an application (“Apps” or “App”, as discussed below) that associates your mobile device with an identifier for your App. We may also receive information that your mobile device sends when you use our Apps, such as a device identifier or OS. Depending on a customer’s configuration of our Offerings, location information about users may be shared with Splunk. You can disable location sharing using the location-setting features on your mobile device.

  

For more information about the data collected through our Offerings, see the Offering-specific documentation (e.g., [Share data in Splunk Enterprise](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Admin/Shareperformancedata) in the Splunk Enterprise Admin Manual).  

How We Use Usage Data We Collect via Our Offerings

We use the data and Information described above to fulfill our contractual obligations in providing the Offerings to you and to fulfill our legitimate interest in supporting and enhancing them. For example, we may use this data and Information to:

  

* Troubleshoot issues, provide support, and update our Offerings
* Provide guidance to help you optimize your configuration, security, and usage of our Offerings
* Better understand how our users use and configure our Offerings
* Determine which configurations or practices optimize performance (e.g., best practices)
* Benchmark key performance indicators (“KPIs”)
* Recommend enhancements
* Perform data analysis and audits
* Identify, understand, and anticipate performance issues and the factors that affect them
* Identify product security issues that may affect you and inform you of them
* Improve and develop new features and functionality
* Monitor the health, performance, and security of our Offerings
* Validate accounts, automate license verification, and offer enhancements
* Offer accelerated troubleshooting, notices of patches/upgrades, tips to optimize usage, security, configurations and/or performance, and suggestions about other Offerings that may be of interest to you
* Analyze usage trends, such as by data type, environment size, scale and architecture, and industry or sector, to develop and prioritize product enhancements (e.g., bug fixes or new features)
* To help us improve the user experience and personalize your services and content
* For any other purpose disclosed to you in connection with our Offerings or other third-party platforms from time to time

  

In certain paid on-premises products, the level of participation can be selected and changed. For more details on what we collect and participation options, see [Splunk’s Documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/ES/latest/Install/Usagedata).  

Other Collection Practices

We also collect Information from you to fulfill our contractual commitments to you. For example, we collect contact Information such as name, address (email and physical) and phone number to enter you into our databases and manage your account. We also collect billing and payment Information and information about how you use our Offerings, including Information such as browser type, version number and operating system (OS), to administer your account, respond to customer service/support inquiries, and provide you with information about software updates via alerts or other “push” notifications. We may share this Information as described in [How Splunk Shares Your Information](#collapseOne_1188511018). We do not sell this Information.

Data Collection Practices Associated with Apps

Splunk's Offerings are extendible using software applications commonly called “apps,” “add-ons,” “widgets,” or “technical add-ons” we offer through [splunkbase.splunk.com](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/) or other websites that may link to this Privacy Policy. We refer to these collectively as “Apps.” These Apps are versatile and have access to a broad set of web technologies that can be used to collect and use your Information. This Privacy Policy only applies to Apps built by or on behalf of Splunk. It does not apply to Apps developed by others (“App Developers”), including those built by Splunk Works and Splunk Labs, which may be available through [splunkbase.splunk.com](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/), third-party marketplaces or repositories (e.g., AWS Marketplace, Google Play Store, and GitHub), or that are otherwise interoperable with our Offerings. Apps developed by App Developers are subject to their privacy notices.  
  

Splunk requires App Developers to comply with applicable privacy and data protection laws but cannot guarantee that they do so. Before you use Apps created by App Developers, you should familiarize yourself with their privacy policies and license agreements.  
  

Splunk collects Information generated from the use and performance of Apps that interoperate with its Offerings, such as crash data, version, session duration, and user engagement (e.g., number of downloads, active/licensed users, and logins). We may share this data with App Developers so they can improve and enhance the performance of their Apps.  
  

How Splunk Shares Your Information

Splunk may disclose your Information to others in the following ways:

Subsidiaries. We may disclose Information to our subsidiaries subject to this Privacy Policy so that they can help market, sell, and service our Offerings. Splunk is the party responsible for the management of jointly used Personal Data. Splunk maintains intragroup agreements covering the use of Personal Data within the Splunk family of companies.

  

Service Providers. We may disclose Information to our service providers (e.g., infrastructure as a service, order fulfillment, professional/customer/support services), pursuant to written agreements with confidentiality, privacy, and security obligations.

  

App Developers. We may disclose Information about App use and performance with App Developers so that they can improve and enhance the performance of their Apps. With your consent, we may also disclose your Information to App Developers to help support the performance of their Apps. App Developers will be identified to you when you download and use their Apps pursuant to their license and other terms.

  

Partners and Sponsors. We may disclose account and contact details to our [partners](https://partners.splunk.com/locator/) and event hosts/sponsors (identified at time of registration or event participation) pursuant to written agreements with confidentiality, privacy, and security obligations. They may use the Information to assess your interest in our Offerings, conduct user research and surveys, or send you marketing communications, subject to the terms of their privacy policies. We may also share Usage Data with partners when they manage your Offering for you.Internet Activity Service Providers. As described further in the [Splunk Cookie Policy](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/splunk-cookie-policy.html), we may disclose internet or other electronic network activity Information, including, but not limited to, browsing history, search history, and Information regarding a consumer’s interaction with a website, or advertisement if you enable or do not disable advertising and cookies.

  

Online Forums. When you take certain actions on blogs and Splunk-branded business communication and streaming platform channels ("Online Forums”) that are public or intended to be public in nature, such as when you broadcast content, participate in a chat room, post profile Information, or follow a channel, that Information may be collected, used, or disclosed by other participants in the Online Forums. In addition, some features of Online Forums are designed to provide others with Information about user activity, such as the subscription status of users for a given channel.

  

Compliance and Safety. We may disclose Information as necessary or appropriate under applicable laws (including laws outside your country of residence) to: comply with legal process or requirements; respond to requests from public or government authorities (including those outside your country of residence); enforce our terms and conditions; and protect our operations and rights and safety of you and others, as needed. For more information about data we disclose in response to requests from law enforcement and other government agencies, please see the [Splunk Data Request Guidelines](https://www.splunk.com/content/dam/splunk2/en_us/pdfs/legal/splunk-data-request-guidelines.pdf).

  

Merger, Sale, etc. We may disclose Information in the event of a proposed or actual corporate or financing transaction, such as a reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, acquisition, assignment, transfer, or disposition of all or any portion of Splunk business, assets, or stock (including Information regarding any bankruptcy or similar proceedings).

  

Other Users. We may disclose Information to other users of our Offerings in aggregated format, provided it does not include Personal Data. This may include “best practices” tips, key performance indicators (KPIs), benchmarking data or other such aggregated information useful to the user community. For select Offerings, we may share Information you provide, such as security artifacts that may contain Personal Data (e.g., IP address) with other subscribers, but only if required as part of the Offering, as set forth in the relevant terms.  

Cookie Preferences

Splunk honors Global Privacy Control (GPC) signals that you enable on your browser. If you do not have GPC enabled on your browser or device, and depending on your location, we will seek your consent or provide an opportunity for you to select which cookies you would like to enable or disable. If you wish to change previously selected cookie preferences, please consult the [Splunk Cookie Policy](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/splunk-cookie-policy.html).

How We Secure Your Information

Splunk takes reasonable technical and organizational measures to safeguard Personal Data against loss, theft, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, misuse, or destruction. Unfortunately, no data transmission, software, or storage system is guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe that your Personal Data may no longer be secure (for example, if you feel that the security of an account has been compromised), please notify us immediately via the communication channels in the [Contact Splunk](#collapseOne_228357674) section below. If Splunk learns of a breach of its systems, Splunk may notify you or others consistent with applicable law and/or as agreed in our contract with you. Splunk may communicate with you electronically regarding privacy and security issues affecting Information collected through your Interactions or use of our Offerings.

How Long We Store Your Information

**Retention Period.** We retain your Information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or not prohibited by applicable law. Information you store in Splunk cloud environments is portable by you at the end of the term of your agreement with Splunk.

**Your Rights**  
  

Individuals located in the UK or European Economic Area are granted certain rights related to Personal Data, including the ability to:  
  

* Ask whether we process Personal Data about you, and if we do, to access the Personal Data and certain information about how we use it and who we share it with;

We will verify your identity, and the identity of any third-party agent acting on your behalf, before we comply with the request and ask for your cooperation with our identity verification process.  
  

**Lawful Basis for Transferring Your Data: Cross-border Transfers**  
  

Your Personal Data may be stored and processed in any country where Splunk, its subsidiaries, partners, sub-processors, and third-party service providers conduct business or host events. These locations may be outside of your country of residence, including in the United States, where different data protection laws may apply. When we transfer Personal Data, we implement safeguards for protection of the transferred Personal Data, such as standard contractual clauses. We put in place appropriate terms to protect your Personal Data in our agreements with our service providers, processors, and sub-processors.  
  

**EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework**  
  

Splunk has certified to the Department of Commerce that we adhere to the Data Privacy Framework Principles (“Principles”) of the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, as further described in the [Splunk Data Privacy Framework Notice](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/legal/data-privacy-framework.html), and Splunk complies with all its obligations under the Principles. However, Splunk does not currently rely on the frameworks for transfers of Personal Data from the EU/EEA/Switzerland and the UK to the United States in its role as a controller. Instead, we continue to rely on standard contractual clauses. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework program, please visit [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/), where you can view Splunk’s certifications.
