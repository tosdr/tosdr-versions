==================================================

​​
==

1. Introduction
    

This Policy sets out the obligations of Schappit Ltd (trading as Piota Apps), a company registered in the United Kingdom under number 09084187, whose registered office is at Oak Business Centre, 79-93 Radcliffe Road, Sileby, Leicester, LE12 7PU (“the Company” or “Us”) regarding data protection and the rights of clients, end users of our app products, and Schappit’s employees and contracted personnel (“data subjects”) in respect of their personal data under UK General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and the Data Protection Act 2018 (amended).

The GDPR defines “personal data” as any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (a “data subject”); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that natural person.

​

The Company is a data controller in respect of information such as Company personnel data and marketing data, and a data processor in respect of information such as data transmitted and displayed on its mobile app products supplied to clients (see Part 20).

​

This Policy sets the Company’s obligations as a data controller and data processor regarding the collection, processing, transfer, storage, and disposal of personal data. The procedures and principles set out herein must be followed at all times by the Company, its employees, agents, contractors, or other parties working on behalf of the Company.

The Company is committed not only to the letter of the law, but also to the spirit of the law and places high importance on the correct, lawful, and fair handling of all personal data, respecting the legal rights, privacy, and trust of all individuals with whom it deals.

​

2\. The Data Protection Principles

This Policy aims to ensure compliance with the GDPR. The GDPR sets out the following principles with which any party handling personal data must comply. All personal data must be:

(c) Adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which it is processed.

(d) Accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date. Every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that is inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which it is processed, is erased, or rectified without delay.

(e) Kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data is processed. Personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes, or statistical purposes, subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational measures required by the GDPR in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject.

(f) Processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures

28\. Transferring Personal Data to a Country Outside the EEA

(a) The Company will take all reasonable measures to ensure data remains inside the EEA region but it may from time to time transfer (‘transfer’ includes making available remotely) personal data to countries outside of the EEA. For example, internet networks are designed to transmit email messages by the most efficient route available at the time without regard to geography.

(b) The transfer of personal data to a country outside of the EEA shall take place only if one or more of the following applies:

(i) The Client or an app end user is based in a country outside the EEA.

(ii) The transfer is to a country, territory, or one or more specific sectors in that country (or an international organisation), that the European Commission has determined ensures an adequate level of protection for personal data;

(iii) The transfer is to a country (or international organisation) which provides appropriate safeguards in the form of a legally binding agreement between public authorities or bodies; binding corporate rules; standard data protection clauses adopted by the European Commission; compliance with an approved code of conduct approved by a supervisory authority (e.g. the Information Commissioner’s Office); certification under an approved certification mechanism (as provided for in the GDPR); contractual clauses agreed and authorised by the competent supervisory authority; or provisions inserted into administrative arrangements between public authorities or bodies authorised by the competent supervisory authority;

(iv) The transfer is made with the informed consent of the relevant data subject(s);

(v) The transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between the data subject and the Company (or for pre-contractual steps taken at the request of the data subject);

(vi) The transfer is necessary for important public interest reasons;

(vii) The transfer is necessary for the conduct of legal claims;

(viii) The transfer is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or other individuals where the data subject is physically or legally unable to give their consent; or

(ix) The transfer is made from a register that, under UK or EU law, is intended to provide information to the public and which is open for access by the public in general or otherwise to those who are able to show a legitimate interest in accessing the register.

29\. Data Breach Notification

(a) All personal data breaches must be reported immediately to the Company’s Data Protection Officer.

(b) If a personal data breach occurs and that breach is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects (e.g. financial loss, breach of confidentiality, discrimination, reputational damage, or other significant social or economic damage), the Data Protection Officer must ensure that the Information Commissioner’s Office is informed of the breach without delay, and in any event, within 72 hours after having become aware of it.

(c) In the event that a personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk (that is, a higher risk than that described under Part 29.2) to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, the Data Protection Officer must ensure that all affected data subjects are informed of the breach directly and without undue delay.

(d) Data breach notifications shall include the following information:

(i) The categories and approximate number of data subjects concerned;

(ii) The categories and approximate number of personal data records concerned;

(iii) The name and contact details of the Company’s data protection officer (or other contact point where more information can be obtained);

(iv) The likely consequences of the breach;
