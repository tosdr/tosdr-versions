* To help make the communication more relevant and contextual
* To better understand how our customers interact with our services

* To determine the effectiveness of our and our clients promotional campaigns
* To identify and prevent fraud

These legitimate business purposes relate to the following activities:

Social Media Advertising Using data provided by you to serve advertising to you on social media platforms such as FaceBook.

* **Profiling** - We will profile your information for marketing purposes to help our clients deliver marketing communication that is more relevant to you (for more information, please refer to the profiling section)  
    We also share anonymised data with third parties that we collaborate with to optimize campaign performance and display online adverts to you. The personal information is hashed using the latest and most secure technology, hashing refers to the process of transforming data to a combination of numbers and letters which cannot be recognised or decoded so it is not considered personal data as it has been anonymised.

Marketing will only ever be from organisations operating within the industry sectors described below.
* To call you where your telephone number is not registered on the TPS.
* To call you where we have obtained your details from a third party. We will always be named within their privacy policy as a party to whom they share your information; once contact is made we will obtain your consent at the earliest opportunity. You will always be given the option to opt out should you not wish to hear from us again.
* To process your personal information for the purposes of customer analysis, non-automated profiling and direct marketing, to help us with our activities and to provide you with the most relevant information as long as this does not harm any of your rights and interests.
* To pass to our clients for use including tracing of individuals, verification and/or validation of the identity of individuals for the purposes of, but not limited to, anti-money laundering regulations, national security, crime prevention and detection, anti-fraud processes, asset recovery and asset reunification.

* To pass some of your details to social media platforms such as Facebook and TV advertising platforms to understand if you use that platform. This is known as matching or linkage. If you do use that platform, we may ask it to show you relevant advertising which we think will be of interest to you based on the information you have previously provided us. If your data does not match, the platform will immediately delete it. The platform will typically match based on email address, postal address or IP address. They will act as processor and will not share the Data with third parties or other advertisers. They will delete the Data promptly after the match process is complete. The platform will maintain the confidentiality and security of the Data by maintaining technical and physical safeguards that are designed to (a) protect the security and integrity of data while it is within the platform's systems and (b) guard against the accidental or unauthorised access, use, alteration or disclosure of data within its systems.

It is important that we keep your details up to date, therefore we use various methods such as Quick Address Systems (QAS) which is a service provided by Experian Ltd, National Change of Address (NCOA®) which uses information taken directly from the redirection application forms of people who are moving and the Edited Electoral Register (EER) which contains the names and addresses of those voters who have indicated that their details can be used for a purpose other than electoral or statutory use, e.g. for direct marketing use by a commercial or other organisation.

For all types of processing, we apply various measures to carefully protect your privacy rights. In considering the most appropriate legal basis, MyOffers conducted Legitimate Interest Assessments. These are detailed evaluations of each type of data processing activity to ensure that we have balanced the need of the processing against the rights of the individual to ensure minimal privacy impact. This documentation is available by writing to: The Data Protection Officer, MyOffers 2019 Limited, Sunningdale, The Belfry Business Park, 13 Colonial Way, Watford, Hertfordshire, WD24 4WH; or by email to: [compliance@myoffersltd.co.uk](mailto:compliance@myoffersltd.co.uk);

**C. Marketing Service Providers** are companies who collect data from Data Controllers, such as ourselves, and help their clients tailor products and services which best suit your needs.

We will share your data with the Marketing Services Providers, who will use it for a variety of direct marketing purposes. Marketing Services Providers carry out data profiling. They will combine your data with data they get from other sources to create models to try to predict behaviour and preferences (e.g. how likely you are to buy a holiday online or take a particular type of holiday) or likely circumstances (e.g. whether you are eligible for a particular credit card). Marketing Services Providers will also try to match and then link your data with data that they receive about you from other sources, to make sure that the data they hold about you is correct (e.g. to check whether you have recently moved address) or keep the IP address they hold about you up to date. IP addresses change regularly. The IP address they receive from us might change too quickly to make the data you provide through us useful for marketing purposes. Marketing Services Provider might find it helpful for this to be refreshed from time to time to ensure marketing messages are being delivered to the correct consumers, on the correct device(s).

They share your data, including the profiled data they have created about you, primarily to:

* help organisations better understand the likely characteristics of their customers (and find others like them);
* improve the relevancy and appropriateness of an organisation’s marketing to its customers (e.g. offers, its products and services); and
* help them communicate with their customers more effectively offline and online. This may mean that you receive tailored advertising via direct mail, when you visit a website, via a mobile app or watch TV. The Marketing Services Providers will not however advertise their own products or services to you.

We do not share information such as cookies. However, Marketing Service Providers may link the personal information we share with them to cookies stored on your browser or device, but only if you have already provided the necessary permissions.

In sharing your data with Marketing Services Providers, we rely on ‘legitimate interest’, as our business depends on our ability to partner with third parties who process personal data for marketing-related reasons. To understand more about the use of your data by Marketing Services Providers, and to find out how to exercise your data protection rights in relation to their use of your data (including how to opt-out),

7 What is Profiling?

Profiling enables organisations to better understand who their customers are so they can make their marketing communications more relevant.

We use some of the information you provide to match with our clients data so that they will better understand the characteristics of their customers, such as age, hobbies and interests. This only happens when you are both on MyOffers database and you are a customer of our client. We do not give them specific information about you but we will tell them how many of the customers are male/female or live in a certain city. We also help identify whether or not you have similar attributes to a typical customer of our client so they can target you with offers of goods and services tailored to you. We will never profile you on the basis of ethnicity, religion, politics or health as these are not valid reasons for which you should be targeted for marketing purposes and nor do we collect this information. We also do not make automated decisions about you which have a negative impact on your rights. Marketing Services Providers we share your data with can also use profiling to target you for marketing purposes. Once again you can ask us to stop using your data in this way at any time.



8 Do we transfer your data to other countries?

Whilst we use overseas call centres to conduct surveys on our behalf, your data is never sent to them but held on secure servers here in the UK. Our call centres are able to access your information in order to conduct surveys on our behalf, under our strict instructions but they are not able to save or download your data into their own systems.

Whilst the majority of our business is with clients resident in the UK we do have some clients based outside of the UK and EEA. Where their local privacy laws have not been approved by the UK and EEA, transfers are made subject to contracts which include Standard Contractual Clauses also known as Model Clauses, approved by the UK and EEA, designed to protect your rights and freedoms under the Applicable Laws here in the United Kingdom.



9 How long will we keep your data for?

We take your data privacy rights seriously. Whilst the law does not put a time limit on the amount of time we should hold your personal data, MyOffers only wishes to retain data for as long as it is required for the purposes for which it was collected; for as long as it remains accurate and up-to-date; and most importantly, for as long as long as you are happy for us to do so.

In addition, to help MyOffers maintain the most recent indication of your marketing and data processing preferences, we will provide you with ongoing reminders of your data subject rights with access to this privacy policy. We refer to this as engagement or notification recency. Therefore our data retention policy considers the purpose, the legal basis under which it is processed and also the most recent engagement.

* Marketing where we process your data under consent we will stop using it for marketing purposes after five years. Where we rely on legitimate interests we will continue to process your data for ten years, subject to receiving notification from ourselves that we hold your information.
* Profiling we will stop using your data for this purpose after ten years.
* Tracing and Credit Reference as this purpose plays an important function of protecting individuals, we will retain your data for twenty years. However, only basic name, date of birth and contact information is retained for this purpose.

In addition, when completing lifestyle questions you may provide us with information such as the make and model of your car or the newspaper you read. Where information such as this has less use over time, it will be removed sooner than the retention periods detailed above.

It is important that the personal data we hold and process is accurate and up-to-date. Therefore, we regularly refresh the database against suppression lists and remove those who no longer wish to be contacted. As we explain in the section marked What are your rights? you can withdraw your consent to us at any time.

11 Do we collect data from other sources?

In order to keep consumer records as up to date as possible we use third party products to help us verify and suppress data.

* Experian QAS, supplied by Experian PLC, is a data verification service. It uses the Edited Electoral Roll and details given by multiple companies to re-verify consumer information.
* Telephone Preference Service (TPS) and Mailing Preference Service (MPS). Managed by the Data and Marketing Association (UK) Ltd, these are central registers of individuals who do not wish to receive unsolicited marketing calls or direct mail. You can register for these free of charge at [www.tpsonline.org.uk](https://www.tpsonline.org.uk/) and [www.mpsonline.org.uk](https://www.mpsonline.org.uk/)

* Clients and other Data Controllers with whom we share data, will on occasion return data to us for the purpose of verification and accuracy. In line with GDPR, this enables us to erase or rectify data without delay.

From time to time, we will also use third parties to supply data subjects personal information to us for marketing purposes.

* Other data controllers - where you have completed a marketing survey either online or by telephone and a DLG brand is named in their privacy policy as a company with whom they share information. DLG will typically rely on legitimate interest for this processing. Consent will only be relied upon with your express permission.
* Publicly available information relating to properties such as Energy Efficiency Ratings or land registry data. We use this information to try to tailor campaigns to your wants and needs where we can rather than sending mass mailings which may not interest you. As this is not considered personal data, a legal basis for processing is not required.
* Acorn, provided by CACI, is a consumer classification that segments UK households, postcodes and neighbourhoods into 6 categories, 18 groups and 62 types. population. Acorn is a postcode level tool rather than an individual level database. As this is not considered personal data, a legal basis for processing is not required.
