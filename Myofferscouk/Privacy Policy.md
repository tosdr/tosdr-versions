    We also share anonymised data with third parties that we collaborate with to optimize campaign performance and display online adverts to you. The personal information is hashed using the latest and most secure technology, hashing refers to the process of transforming data to a combination of numbers and letters which cannot be recognised or decoded so it is not considered personal data as it has been anonymised.

If your data does not match, the platform will immediately delete it. The platform will typically match based on email address, postal address or IP address. They will act as processor and will not share the Data with third parties or other advertisers. They will delete the Data promptly after the match process is complete. The platform will maintain the confidentiality and security of the Data by maintaining technical and physical safeguards that are designed to (a) protect the security and integrity of data while it is within the platform's systems and (b) guard against the accidental or unauthorised access, use, alteration or disclosure of data within its systems.

It is important that we keep your details up to date, therefore we use various methods such as Quick Address Systems (QAS) which is a service provided by Experian Ltd, National Change of Address (NCOA®) which uses information taken directly from the redirection application forms of people who are moving and the Edited Electoral Register (EER) which contains the names and addresses of those voters who have indicated that their details can be used for a purpose other than electoral or statutory use, e.g. for direct marketing use by a commercial or other organisation.

For all types of processing, we apply various measures to carefully protect your privacy rights. In considering the most appropriate legal basis, MyOffers conducted Legitimate Interest Assessments. These are detailed evaluations of each type of data processing activity to ensure that we have balanced the need of the processing against the rights of the individual to ensure minimal privacy impact. This documentation is available by writing to: The Data Protection Officer, MyOffers 2019 Limited, Sunningdale, The Belfry Business Park, 13 Colonial Way, Watford, Hertfordshire, WD24 4WH; or by email to: [compliance@myoffersltd.co.uk](mailto:compliance@myoffersltd.co.uk);

We will share your data with the Marketing Services Providers, who will use it for a variety of direct marketing purposes. Marketing Services Providers carry out data profiling.

Marketing Services Providers will also try to match and then link your data with data that they receive about you from other sources, to make sure that the data they hold about you is correct (e.g. to check whether you have recently moved address) or keep the IP address they hold about you up to date. IP addresses change regularly. The IP address they receive from us might change too quickly to make the data you provide through us useful for marketing purposes. Marketing Services Provider might find it helpful for this to be refreshed from time to time to ensure marketing messages are being delivered to the correct consumers, on the correct device(s).

* help organisations better understand the likely characteristics of their customers (and find others like them);

7 What is Profiling?

Profiling enables organisations to better understand who their customers are so they can make their marketing communications more relevant.

We use some of the information you provide to match with our clients data so that they will better understand the characteristics of their customers, such as age, hobbies and interests. This only happens when you are both on MyOffers database and you are a customer of our client. We do not give them specific information about you but we will tell them how many of the customers are male/female or live in a certain city. We also help identify whether or not you have similar attributes to a typical customer of our client so they can target you with offers of goods and services tailored to you. We will never profile you on the basis of ethnicity, religion, politics or health as these are not valid reasons for which you should be targeted for marketing purposes and nor do we collect this information. We also do not make automated decisions about you which have a negative impact on your rights. Marketing Services Providers we share your data with can also use profiling to target you for marketing purposes. Once again you can ask us to stop using your data in this way at any time.



Our call centres are able to access your information in order to conduct surveys on our behalf, under our strict instructions but they are not able to save or download your data into their own systems.

In addition, to help MyOffers maintain the most recent indication of your marketing and data processing preferences, we will provide you with ongoing reminders of your data subject rights with access to this privacy policy. We refer to this as engagement or notification recency. Therefore our data retention policy considers the purpose, the legal basis under which it is processed and also the most recent engagement.
