**3.5 Subscription License Billing** - By purchasing a monthly Subscription License, you agree that OneLaunch may submit monthly charges at the then current Subscription License price to your payment method without further authorization from you until you provide prior notice that you wish to terminate your monthly Subscription License, or you wish to change your payment method. By purchasing an annual Subscription License, you agree that OneLaunch may submit annual charges at the then current Subscription License price to your payment method without further authorization from you, until you provide prior notice that you wish to terminate your annual Subscription License, or you wish to change your payment method. ONELAUNCH SUBSCRIPTIONS LICENSES CAN BE CANCELLED AT ANY TIME. As used in this Agreement, “billed” or “billing” shall indicate either a charge or debit, as applicable, against your payment method. The Subscription License will be billed at the beginning of the paying portion or your Subscription License and each month or year (as applicable) thereafter unless and until you cancel your Subscription License. OneLaunch will automatically bill your payment method each month or each year on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your Subscription License or within 2-3 business days of such date. You acknowledge that the amount billed each month or year may vary from month to month or year to year for reasons that may include without limitation differing amounts due to promotional offers or upgrades/downgrades to different Subscription License plans offered by OneLaunch, and you authorize OneLaunch to charge your payment method for such varying amounts. Subscription License pricing and charges are subject to change at any time and in OneLaunch’s sole discretion. OneLaunch may change the Subscription License fees and charges in effect, or add new fees and charges from time to time.

You will receive a Subscription License cancellation confirmation from OneLaunch. Please allow 2-3 business days to process your cancellation request. Once your cancellation request has been processed, you will no longer be charged for any future Subscription License fees for the applicable license period, or have access to certain features and functionality of the Software, unless you decide to purchase a Subscription License again in the future. Following the cancellation of your Subscription License, you will continue to have access to or use any of the features and/or functionality available through the applicable Subscription License for the remainder of the current billing period.

**3.7 Subscription License Refund Policy** - If you are not satisfied with your Subscription License, you may be entitled to a full refund of the most recent Subscription License fee that has been billed to your payment method, provided that your refund request is received by OneLaunch within forty-five (45) days of the billing date of the Subscription License fee payment (the “Refund Period”).
