[🚗✨ Here’s my one-day bucket list itinerary ![🚗✨ Here’s my one-day bucket list itinerary for SEBASTOPOL, CALIFORNIA
(💫 SAVE for planning your trip to Northern #California💫)
1️⃣ Start the morning with coffee & pastries  @brewtaylorlane ☕️ 
2️⃣ Go to @boringfarm to pick some raspberries. It’s a do-it-yourself place, so grab your box and load up. Plus, don’t skip the raspberry popsicle!  PS: this is the last weekend of the season, so make sure to grab your spot online.
3️⃣ Stroll down Florence Avenue to check out the quirky junk art—seriously, every few houses has its own little masterpiece. 
4️⃣ Grab lunch @handline.sebastopol—it’s a casual coastal-centric restaurant that has great tacos and soft serve ice cream 🌮
5️⃣ Wine lovers, @drinkregion is a MUST. They have over 50 self-serve wines—you can taste or go all in for a full glass! 🍷
6️⃣ Explore and shopping @thebarlow707—a 12-acre open-air market district.
Here’s some of my favorite shops: 
@acorn.shop: cute home goods and gifts
@rustboutique: women’s clothes & jewelry
@jgswitzer: Fiber art & felted fabrics for the home
@indigenousdesigns: : Beautiful organic and fair trade fashion
7️⃣ Play some pinball at @therewindarcade. Load up your playing card and go wild with so many retro games!
8️⃣ Get a pre-dinner cocktail at the super trendy @fernbar.sebastopol. I got the creamy Thai Iced Tea, and it was almost too pretty to drink! PS: their food there is great too!
9️⃣ Have dinner @ramengaijin— a yummy ramen shop and izakaya. The best seats are at the ramen counter! 🍜 
1️⃣0️⃣ And no day is complete without dessert, so hit up @screaminmimisicecream for some ice cream🍦 I loved the cherry chocolate almond flavor!
