👉 Save for your next trip to San Francisco, California 👈
From iconic Golden Gate vistas to Eastern Mediterranean delights, here’s how to make the most of your visit to the @presidiosf National Park site:
1️⃣ Start with a cozy breakfast @InnatthePresidio—coffee, pastries, and morning vibes by the fire pit 🔥 
2️⃣ Explore Andy Goldsworthy’s stunning outdoor art installations that are scattered around the Presidio (Woodline, Spire & Earth Wall!).
3️⃣  dive into the 10,000 years of Presidio history at the Presidio Heritage Gallery located at the Presidio Officers’ Club. (It’s free!)
4️⃣ Check out the Walt Disney Family Museum for a little behind-the-scenes magic
—a must for Disney fans! @wdfmuseum 
5️⃣ For lunch, go to @Colibri.presidio whose trendy vibe and Mexican dishes won me over, especially the carnitas served in the cutest ceramic pig 🐷 
6️⃣ Explore 14 acres the Tunnel Tops, a  national park space built by the community, for the community.
7️⃣ Chase the perfect Golden Gate Bridge view (Battery Godfrey was my fave, but Fort Point was a close second).
8️⃣ Unwind back at the Inn with their evening wine and cheese by the fire pit.
9️⃣ Have an unforgettable Dinner at @Dalidasf, an eastern mediterranean restaurant where it’s mandatory to start your meal with their breaking bread pita and end it with their layered baklava.
1️⃣0️⃣ End on a playful note @Presidio_Bowl, where your face turns into hilarious animations after every frame.

[California’s Yountville is right in the heart of ![California’s Yountville is right in the heart of Napa Valley, and is a food lover’s dream! With its wine country charm, the bar for great food is set high—and it doesn’t disappoint. I happily ate my way through the town to find the best spots. While you can’t really go wrong, these are my favs: 
👉 Save for your trip to the Napa Valley!
🍳 @bardessonoyountville’s Lucy: Perfect spot for brunch. The chilaquiles are delish & the avocado toast is the prettiest ever!
🍝 @botteganapavalley is a hotspot for good reason—it delivers on all fronts—food, cocktails, and atmosphere. My standout dish was the Brodetto Frutta de Mar, a seafood stew so good you might just buy Chiarello’s cookbook to make it at home!
🦪 @bouchon_bistro: This place will make you feel like you’re in France. Don’t skip the French onion soup. After go right next door to hit up @bouchon_bakery for dessert!
🥗 @therdkitchens: Pan-Asian noodle salad + the crispy chicken sandwich = perfection.
🍅 @bistro.jeanty: Cozy French vibes and the famous Boeuf Bourguignon.
🌟 The French Laundry (@_tfl_ ) Three-Michelin star Thomas Keller Restaurant that’s the ultimate bucket list splurge. 
🍕 @ciccio_napavalley: Wood-fired pizza + House-made pasta = happy foodie.
🍗 @adhoc_addendum: Fried chicken so good it’ll make you cry.
🐙 @northblockyountville: Trendy wine country eats like charred octopus & maple leaf duck breast
🍣 @ro.lounge: Another Thomas Keller gem that draws from Asian culinary influences. If you love caviar, this is your place!](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='1000'%20height='560'%20viewBox='0%200%201000%20560'%3E%3C/svg%3E)
