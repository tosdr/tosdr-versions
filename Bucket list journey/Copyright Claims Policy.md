[Ready to tackle 313 stairs down to California’s ![Ready to tackle 313 stairs down to California’s historic Point Reyes Lighthouse... and then 313 stairs back up? 😅 (Yes, your quads will feel it, but it’s worth it!). This beauty sits along the rugged coastline of the Point Reyes National Seashore, offering killer views—if Mother Nature cooperates, that is ☁️ 
Tip: Check your weather app before heading out! The area is notorious for fog that likes to crash the party, blocking those postcard-worthy ocean views. Your best bet? Visit on a sunny, clear day (afternoons usually give you the best chance).
Not up for all those stairs? No worries! There’s a great viewing platform near the parking lot where you can still soak in the scenery without the climb (though there is still a .4 mile walk to the platform!).

1️⃣ @ramengaijin 🍜 Ramen bowls, donburi, and crispy kara-age to die for! Sit at the counter to catch all the kitchen action.

[🚗✨ Here’s my one-day bucket list itinerary ![🚗✨ Here’s my one-day bucket list itinerary for POINT REYES, CALIFORNIA
(💫 SAVE for planning your trip to Northern #California💫)
1️⃣ Have coffee & pastries @brickmaidenbreads ☕️ All their pastries look yummy, but I loved the ginger scone. We also grabbed a loaf of seeded levain for the road 😋 
2️⃣ Make a quick stop at the Inverness shipwreck 🚢  The old S.S. Point Reyes may be weathered, but it’s got character! 
3️⃣ Stop at the Cypress Tree Tunnel. This spot is Instagram gold! No driving allowed, but it’s totally worth the stop for that perfect photo under the leafy canopy. 
4️⃣ Hike the stairs to the #pointreyeslighthouse —313 stairs down…and yep, 313 back up! Pro tip: check the weather (fog-free days are a win). If it’s closed, the Chimney Rock hike is a great alternative with epic views! 
5️⃣ Explore downtown Point Reyes Station. Tiny town, BIG charm! Don’t miss Cowgirl Barn for cheeses and picnic goodies, Toby’s Feed Barn for everything from jewelry to chocolate, plus @westmarinwoolshed @captainokodesign and @Vita Collage for home goods. 
6️⃣ Do a cheese tasting at @pointreyescheese 🧀 Sit-down tastings go until September, but you can always stop by their shop for samples. If cheese for lunch isn’t calling your name, head to @thefarmersxwife inside the Cowgirl Barn. Get the tuna melt with potato chips ON it—thank me later. 😉 
7️⃣ Do a Mead Tasting at @heidrunmeadery 🍯 Pick a flight of four meads or just enjoy a glass. If you’re there on a Saturday, tours are available too! 
8️⃣ Stop @little_wing_farm Veggie & Flower Stand 🌶️ It’s an honor-system farm stand with the prettiest flowers and freshest veggies. Cash only—so come prepared! (The shishitos are 💯.) 
9️⃣ Eat dinner @cafereyes_94956 🍕 this place has chill vibes and wood-fired pizza with names inspired by the area. We ordered the Miwok pizza and a fresh mozzarella salad—perfect end to a perfect day! 
Thanks for tagging along to Point Reyes 😊
