These were my faves (👉 you’re gonna want to add them to your #northerncalifornia bucket list!):
🚁 Flying high on a Shasta Bally Helicopter Tour with @Av8_aviation. Birds-eye views of snowcapped mountains, Shasta dam and the famous Sundial Bridge!  
🦇 Going underground to explore @LakeShastaCaverns—it’s like stepping into another world down there. 
💧 Taking the Shasta Dam Tour (and it was way cooler than I expected!). Not only can you walk across the top of this massive marvel, but you can go inside of it too 🤩 Plus, it’s totally FREE. 
🌿 There’s tons of waterfalls in the Redding area, but Crystal Creek Falls is super accessible and so pretty.

👉 Save for your next trip to San Francisco, California 👈

1️⃣ Start with a cozy breakfast @InnatthePresidio—coffee, pastries, and morning vibes by the fire pit 🔥 
2️⃣ Explore Andy Goldsworthy’s stunning outdoor art installations that are scattered around the Presidio (Woodline, Spire & Earth Wall!).

5️⃣ For lunch, go to @Colibri.presidio whose trendy vibe and Mexican dishes won me over, especially the carnitas served in the cutest ceramic pig 🐷 
6️⃣ Explore 14 acres the Tunnel Tops, a  national park space built by the community, for the community.
7️⃣ Chase the perfect Golden Gate Bridge view (Battery Godfrey was my fave, but Fort Point was a close second).
8️⃣ Unwind back at the Inn with their evening wine and cheese by the fire pit.
9️⃣ Have an unforgettable Dinner at @Dalidasf, an eastern mediterranean restaurant where it’s mandatory to start your meal with their breaking bread pita and end it with their layered baklava.
1️⃣0️⃣ End on a playful note @Presidio_Bowl, where your face turns into hilarious animations after every frame.
1️⃣1️⃣ Go back to the @InnatthePresidio for a nightcap and some well-earned rest.](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='1000'%20height='560'%20viewBox='0%200%201000%20560'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

But this train wasn’t just about food and wine, it’s also about the wine country vibe—slow, scenic, and oh-so-relaxing. The route winds from Downtown Napa to St. Helena and back, with plenty of pretty vineyard views along the way 🍇
