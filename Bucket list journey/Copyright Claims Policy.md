I just had the perfect little getaway @innatthepresidio and it had everything I needed to get into the spirit.
It was filled with twinkling holiday décor, a cozy room that was hard to leave, evening wine and cheese by the fire pit (my favorite time of the day!), and a breakfast that sets you up to explore the Presidio the way it deserves to be explored—enjoying the outdoors with friends and family 🥰

[California’s Yountville is right in the heart of ![California’s Yountville is right in the heart of Napa Valley, and is a food lover’s dream! With its wine country charm, the bar for great food is set high—and it doesn’t disappoint. I happily ate my way through the town to find the best spots. While you can’t really go wrong, these are my favs: 
👉 Save for your trip to the Napa Valley!
🍳 @bardessonoyountville’s Lucy: Perfect spot for brunch. The chilaquiles are delish & the avocado toast is the prettiest ever!
🍝 @botteganapavalley is a hotspot for good reason—it delivers on all fronts—food, cocktails, and atmosphere. My standout dish was the Brodetto Frutta de Mar, a seafood stew so good you might just buy Chiarello’s cookbook to make it at home!
🦪 @bouchon_bistro: This place will make you feel like you’re in France. Don’t skip the French onion soup. After go right next door to hit up @bouchon_bakery for dessert!
🥗 @therdkitchens: Pan-Asian noodle salad + the crispy chicken sandwich = perfection.
🍅 @bistro.jeanty: Cozy French vibes and the famous Boeuf Bourguignon.
🌟 The French Laundry (@_tfl_ ) Three-Michelin star Thomas Keller Restaurant that’s the ultimate bucket list splurge. 
🍕 @ciccio_napavalley: Wood-fired pizza + House-made pasta = happy foodie.
🍗 @adhoc_addendum: Fried chicken so good it’ll make you cry.
🐙 @northblockyountville: Trendy wine country eats like charred octopus & maple leaf duck breast
🍣 @ro.lounge: Another Thomas Keller gem that draws from Asian culinary influences. If you love caviar, this is your place!](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='1000'%20height='560'%20viewBox='0%200%201000%20560'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

[Ever wonder what a perfect day in the Napa Valley ![Ever wonder what a perfect day in the Napa Valley wine country looks like? Here’s my one-day bucket list itinerary for YOUNTVILLE, CALIFORNIA 🍷
1️⃣ Start your day in #Yountville the only way you should—with pastries! @Bouchon_Bakery is tiny but mighty, serving up buttery scones, flaky croissants, and giant macarons 🥐 
2️⃣ Next, hop aboard the Napa Valley @winetrain where you’ll be served a four course meal while riding through Napa valley Vineyards and sipping on local wine 🚂 They have plenty of experiences to choose from (we did the Vista Dome and loved it!)
3️⃣ Head to @PriestRanchWines for wine AND bacon tasting. Yep, you heard me right—bacon. 🥓 It was six wines, four types of bacon, and one happy me. The mango mustard bacon was my favorite!
4️⃣ Take a break from eating and drinking (if you can!) and wander the Yountville Art Walk. 🎨 Over 30 sculptures, each with a QR code for all the artsy details. My fave? The Chef. 
Plus, you’ll pass lots of shops for a little retail therapy. A couple of my favs are @KollarChocolates and the boutique @AlchemyWorks
5️⃣ Now it’s time for a pre-dinner cocktail at @NorthBlockYountville. 🍸 Trendy, chic, and perfect for happy hour vibes. 
6️⃣ Dinner is at @BottegaNapaValley—Yountville’s foodie hotspot. Their Brodetto ai Frutti di Mare was the BEST thing I ate in Yountville 😋  It was so good I had to get the recipe from the Bottega cookbook!
7️⃣ End your day with a nightcap in your room by the fireplace or next to the fire pits in the courtyard @NapaValleyLodge.
