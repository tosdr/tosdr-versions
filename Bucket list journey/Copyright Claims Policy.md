1️⃣ Start your morning @evergreen.rdd with amazing coffee and seasonal avocado toast. Bonus is if you make it for $5 Waffle Sundays aka waffle church.
2️⃣ Take the Shasta Dam Tour – It’s free, it’s massive, and yes, you can walk on top of it and go inside.
3️⃣ Explore @LakeShastaCaverns – A cool boat rides over the lake and 612 stairs lead to limestone caves with amazing formations. Worth every step!
4️⃣ Lunch at @pipeline_craft_taps: You cannot skip the duck fat fries—trust me on this one. But the seared ahi bowl? So good I actually went back for it a second time!
5️⃣ Turtle Bay Exploration Park (@turtlebay_redding) – Museums, wildlife, and a stroll across the iconic Sundial Bridge. Oh, and say hi 👋 to Timber the beaver for me!
6️⃣ Explore & Shop Downtown Redding: Street art and cute boutiques galore (my favorite was @ridecarousel who had me with their trendy clothes and dainty necklaces).
7️⃣ Taste wine @new_clairvaux_vineyard_redding (I loved their Primitivo 🍷)! If you’re more of a beer person grab a flight  @finaldraftbrewingco
8️⃣ Dinner at Paradisio –  I had the tofu curry that had just the right amount of spice, but the elk burger looked delicious too!

[If you’re a foodie like me and heading to the #N ![If you’re a foodie like me and heading to the #NorthernCalifornia city of Redding, you might be surprised by the food scene! I’ve done the research 😋 and these are my favorite spots to grab a bite:
▪️ Paradisio: Cozy vibes, bold flavors—try the tofu curry or the elk burger 
▪️ @pipeline_craft_taps: Absolutely, positively don’t skip the duck fat fries, but the seared ahi bowl is yummy too (I actually went back a second time to get it!).
▪️ @mosaic_redding: Trendy Space + Crispy Brussels + King Salmon = perfection. 
▪️ @vintageredding: Another place with delish Brussels sprouts & salmon with pesto. I think there’s a trend in Redding 🤔 
▪️ @odellcraftbbq: drool worthy BBQ, but you can only get it on Thursdays & Fridays (but get there early, they sell out!).
▪️ @jacksgrillredding1938: Since 1938 this has been a no frills staple in Redding with hand-cut steaks & timeless vibes.
▪️ @evergreen.rdd: Not technically a restaurant, but their breakfast menu is worth a visit! Local Persian avo toast + $5 “waffle church” on Sundays = brunch goals.

These were my faves (👉 you’re gonna want to add them to your #northerncalifornia bucket list!):
🚁 Flying high on a Shasta Bally Helicopter Tour with @Av8_aviation. Birds-eye views of snowcapped mountains, Shasta dam and the famous Sundial Bridge!  
🦇 Going underground to explore @LakeShastaCaverns—it’s like stepping into another world down there. 
💧 Taking the Shasta Dam Tour (and it was way cooler than I expected!). Not only can you walk across the top of this massive marvel, but you can go inside of it too 🤩 Plus, it’s totally FREE. 
🌿 There’s tons of waterfalls in the Redding area, but Crystal Creek Falls is super accessible and so pretty. 
🏌️‍♀️ Hitting a few golf balls into the water at @reddingaquagolf (don’t worry, they’re supposed to go in the water 🤣).](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='1000'%20height='560'%20viewBox='0%200%201000%20560'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

6️⃣ Explore 14 acres the Tunnel Tops, a  national park space built by the community, for the community.

8️⃣ Unwind back at the Inn with their evening wine and cheese by the fire pit.
9️⃣ Have an unforgettable Dinner at @Dalidasf, an eastern mediterranean restaurant where it’s mandatory to start your meal with their breaking bread pita and end it with their layered baklava.

—a must for Disney fans! @wdfmuseum 
5️⃣ For lunch, go to @Colibri.presidio whose trendy vibe and Mexican dishes won me over, especially the carnitas served in the cutest ceramic pig 🐷 
6️⃣ Explore 14 acres the Tunnel Tops, a  national park space built by the community, for the community.
7️⃣ Chase the perfect Golden Gate Bridge view (Battery Godfrey was my fave, but Fort Point was a close second).
8️⃣ Unwind back at the Inn with their evening wine and cheese by the fire pit.
9️⃣ Have an unforgettable Dinner at @Dalidasf, an eastern mediterranean restaurant where it’s mandatory to start your meal with their breaking bread pita and end it with their layered baklava.
1️⃣0️⃣ End on a playful note @Presidio_Bowl, where your face turns into hilarious animations after every frame.
1️⃣1️⃣ Go back to the @InnatthePresidio for a nightcap and some well-earned rest.](https://bucketlistjourney.net/wp-content/plugins/instagram-feed/img/placeholder.png)](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DDPhGv9pW3d/)
