[🌳 Here’s my one-day bucket list itinerary for ![🌳 Here’s my one-day bucket list itinerary for GOLDEN GATE PARK, SAN FRANCISCO 🌳
(💫 SAVE for planning your trip to Northern #California💫)
Want to conquer all that Golden Gate Park has to offer in just one day? Challenge accepted! At over 1,000 acres (bigger than Central Park!), this park is a haven of gardens, museums, lakes, and trails. Here’s how to make the most of it:
1️⃣ Have coffee & Pastries @tartinebakery in the Inner Sunset ☕🥐 This local gem is famous for its pastries (and sourdough bread!)—seriously, their babka is a must-try!
2️⃣ Explore the California Academy of Sciences (@calacademy) 🐠 Don’t miss the four-story Osher Rainforest (butterflies galore!) or the bioluminescent creatures in the aquarium.
3️⃣ Stop by @conservatoryofflowers 🌸 They’ve got giant water lilies and rare orchids, plus the building is a 100+ year-old wood-and-glass building.
4️⃣ See the masterpieces at @deyoungmuseum 🎨  Not a museum lover? Neither am I, but the de Young might have changed my mind. It’s packed with art from the 17th century to today
5️⃣ Grab lunch @hookfishco🐟🌮 Fuel up with poke bowls, fish tacos, and guac at this laid-back spot near Ocean Beach. Outdoor seating only, so bundle up if it’s chilly!
6️⃣ Make a Quick Stop at Queen Wilhelmina Garden and the Dutch Windmill 🌷 Spring tulips are a highlight, but even in the off-season (I was there in fall), the windmill is a photo-op.
7️⃣ Pedal Boat on Blue Heron Lake 🚤 Hop into a pedal or rowboat @blueheronboathouse. Cruise around, enjoy the scenery and get a little leg workout at the same time!
8️⃣ Walk the JFK Promenade 🚶‍♀️Take a scenic walk along this artsy Promenade toward the Japanese Tea Garden.
9️⃣ Stroll through the @japaneseteagardensf 🍁 Finish the day in peace at this 5-acre haven of koi ponds, pagodas, and cherry blossoms (in March/April). 
1️⃣0️⃣ Dinner at @kothaisf 🍽
End your adventure with a feast at this cozy spot in the Inner Sunset. Their Asian-inspired dishes like Slow Shrooms and Monterey Squid are the perfect way to wrap up a day well-spent.

[Ready to tackle 313 stairs down to California’s ![Ready to tackle 313 stairs down to California’s historic Point Reyes Lighthouse... and then 313 stairs back up? 😅 (Yes, your quads will feel it, but it’s worth it!). This beauty sits along the rugged coastline of the Point Reyes National Seashore, offering killer views—if Mother Nature cooperates, that is ☁️ 
Tip: Check your weather app before heading out! The area is notorious for fog that likes to crash the party, blocking those postcard-worthy ocean views. Your best bet? Visit on a sunny, clear day (afternoons usually give you the best chance).
Not up for all those stairs? No worries! There’s a great viewing platform near the parking lot where you can still soak in the scenery without the climb (though there is still a .4 mile walk to the platform!).

1️⃣ @ramengaijin 🍜 Ramen bowls, donburi, and crispy kara-age to die for! Sit at the counter to catch all the kitchen action.
