[If you’re heading to the #NorthernCalifornia coa ![If you’re heading to the #NorthernCalifornia coastal town of Bodega Bay, then you’re probably gonna want to eat some seafood (as well as you should!) 🦀
⚡️ SAVE FOR YOUR TRIP TO BODEGA⚡️
Here are my top picks for fishy (in the best way) spots you won’t want to miss: 🐟🍽️
1️⃣ @Fishetarian Fish Market - Fresh, sustainable, and delish! I’m talking shrimp tacos, fish & chips, and their famous clam chowder, all with gorgeous bay views. Perfect for when you want to keep things chill but leave oh-so-satisfied.  
2️⃣ Spud Point Crab Company - The clam chowder here has won awards for a reason (soooo good!). Oh, and the crab sandwich? It’s LOADED with 1/4 pound of crab. 🦞 Just be prepared to wait—there’s always a line, but it’s worth it! 
3️⃣ @rockeroysterfellerslucaswharf - Southern comfort meets seafood heaven. Their oysters Rockefeller are mainly what people come for, but their clam chowder was one of my favs! And if you’re lucky, you might just spot some seals while you dine 🦭  
4️⃣ The Birds Cafe - Part seafood joint, part coffee shop, and part gift shop (yes, adorable). Their calamari totally won me over, and their fish & chips is an absolute must-try! Casual but perfect for a bite with a view. 🎣 
5️⃣ Gourmet Au Bay - Seafood and wine with a view? Yes, please! Their wood-fired smoke clam pizza and crab cakes are 🔥. This place has more than seafood, but trust me, the seafood is where it’s at. 🍷 
6️⃣ Drakes Sonoma Coast - Farm-to-table goodness with serious coastal vibes. It’s at @lodgeatbodegabay (which was just voted #1 hotel in the WORLD by @condenast!) So yeah, this place is fancy by Bodega Bay standards, but the seafood lives up to it🍴 
7️⃣ Terrapin Creek Café - This place earned a Michelin star in 2015 and still holds a place in their guide ⭐️ Don’t miss their Mediterranean stew that has the best mix of seafood!
Which one do you want to try? 😋 Let me know in the comments! 👇

[🚗✨ Here’s my one-day bucket list itinerary ![🚗✨ Here’s my one-day bucket list itinerary for SEBASTOPOL, CALIFORNIA
(💫 SAVE for planning your trip to Northern #California💫)
1️⃣ Start the morning with coffee & pastries  @brewtaylorlane ☕️ 
2️⃣ Go to @boringfarm to pick some raspberries. It’s a do-it-yourself place, so grab your box and load up. Plus, don’t skip the raspberry popsicle!  PS: this is the last weekend of the season, so make sure to grab your spot online.
3️⃣ Stroll down Florence Avenue to check out the quirky junk art—seriously, every few houses has its own little masterpiece. 
4️⃣ Grab lunch @handline.sebastopol—it’s a casual coastal-centric restaurant that has great tacos and soft serve ice cream 🌮
5️⃣ Wine lovers, @drinkregion is a MUST. They have over 50 self-serve wines—you can taste or go all in for a full glass! 🍷
6️⃣ Explore and shopping @thebarlow707—a 12-acre open-air market district.
Here’s some of my favorite shops: 
@acorn.shop: cute home goods and gifts
@rustboutique: women’s clothes & jewelry
@jgswitzer: Fiber art & felted fabrics for the home
@indigenousdesigns: : Beautiful organic and fair trade fashion
7️⃣ Play some pinball at @therewindarcade. Load up your playing card and go wild with so many retro games!
8️⃣ Get a pre-dinner cocktail at the super trendy @fernbar.sebastopol. I got the creamy Thai Iced Tea, and it was almost too pretty to drink! PS: their food there is great too!
9️⃣ Have dinner @ramengaijin— a yummy ramen shop and izakaya. The best seats are at the ramen counter! 🍜 
1️⃣0️⃣ And no day is complete without dessert, so hit up @screaminmimisicecream for some ice cream🍦 I loved the cherry chocolate almond flavor!
