[Ever wonder what a perfect day in the Napa Valley ![Ever wonder what a perfect day in the Napa Valley wine country looks like? Here’s my one-day bucket list itinerary for YOUNTVILLE, CALIFORNIA 🍷
1️⃣ Start your day in #Yountville the only way you should—with pastries! @Bouchon_Bakery is tiny but mighty, serving up buttery scones, flaky croissants, and giant macarons 🥐 
2️⃣ Next, hop aboard the Napa Valley @winetrain where you’ll be served a four course meal while riding through Napa valley Vineyards and sipping on local wine 🚂 They have plenty of experiences to choose from (we did the Vista Dome and loved it!)
3️⃣ Head to @PriestRanchWines for wine AND bacon tasting. Yep, you heard me right—bacon. 🥓 It was six wines, four types of bacon, and one happy me. The mango mustard bacon was my favorite!
4️⃣ Take a break from eating and drinking (if you can!) and wander the Yountville Art Walk. 🎨 Over 30 sculptures, each with a QR code for all the artsy details. My fave? The Chef. 
Plus, you’ll pass lots of shops for a little retail therapy. A couple of my favs are @KollarChocolates and the boutique @AlchemyWorks
5️⃣ Now it’s time for a pre-dinner cocktail at @NorthBlockYountville. 🍸 Trendy, chic, and perfect for happy hour vibes. 
6️⃣ Dinner is at @BottegaNapaValley—Yountville’s foodie hotspot. Their Brodetto ai Frutti di Mare was the BEST thing I ate in Yountville 😋  It was so good I had to get the recipe from the Bottega cookbook!
7️⃣ End your day with a nightcap in your room by the fireplace or next to the fire pits in the courtyard @NapaValleyLodge.

[Save this hotel for your Yountville, California Bu ![Save this hotel for your Yountville, California Bucket List. @NapaValleyLodge is just minutes away from everything you’ll want to do in Yountville, but you may not want to leave. 
The grounds alone are dreamy, with their relaxing fountains trickling in the background, fire pits crackling under the stars, a sparkling pool calling your name, and plenty of cozy spots to lounge with a glass of wine (or two 😉). 
Oh, and did I mention the bocce ball court? Because a little friendly competition pairs perfectly with a day of wine tasting 🍷

When my friend @inspiringoptimism invited me to her dreamy vacation rental @hummingwayranch for a paint night, I was SO in! #bucketlist 
The mission? Four of us, armed with paintbrushes, a YouTube tutorial, and lots of wine, took on the challenge of painting (or at least attempting to paint 😂) a colorful peacock 🦚 Let’s just say, some of our peacocks had very unique personalities!
Did I mention that there were delicious tacos too? 😋
