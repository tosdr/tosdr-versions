**Lumen Settlement-Free Peering Policy**
========================================

Revised September 9, 2021

  
Lumen is a global communications and IT services company, operating in over 60 countries and focused on connecting its customers to the power of the digital world. While interconnection with the Lumen network is generally handled commercially, there are a small number of internet networks with which it may be mutually beneficial for Lumen to enter into a settlement-free interconnection, or âpeeringâ agreement.Â  Lumen has developed this policy to provide guidelines for the selection of peers on a global or regional basis. Lumen selects peers based upon, among other things, relative size and scope of network, complementary reach of peer networks and the overall strategic benefit Lumen will experience with the connection. Compliance with the technical and operational requirements set forth in this policy does not guarantee a peering relationship with Lumen.Â  Potential peers should allow for a minimum of two weeks for Lumen to provide a preliminary response to a request related to peering.

  
Lumen evaluates this policy on an ongoing basis and reserves the right to make changes to it at any time in its sole discretion.Â  This peering policy is only a guideline, not an agreement or a set of rules governing a specific peering relationship.Â  Peering may only occur pursuant to an agreement executed between Lumen and the peer that sets forth details related to interconnection architecture, port capacity, dispute resolution and operational matters, among other things.Â  Lumen may require a trial peering interconnection arrangement with potential peers. Such a trial will only occur subsequent to execution by both parties of a Peering Trial Agreement. A successful peering trial, however, does not guarantee that Lumen will agree to a longer-term peering agreement.Â 

**  
General Principles for Settlement-Free Peering**
-----------------------------------------------------

The following general principles serve as the foundation for the specific settlement-free peering qualifications set forth below in this policy:  
Â 

1. The backbone cost burden associated with settlement-free peering traffic exchange should be equitably shared. Regardless of the direction or type of traffic exchanged between the networks, the routing practices and location of interconnection points should be such that each party bears a reasonably equal share of backbone costs.
2. The primary objective of a peering arrangement is to enable each party to deliver high-quality service to its customers.
3. The interconnection architecture and traffic exchange practices should assure that the exchange of traffic is resilient, scalable, and secure.
4. Any termination or modification of a peering arrangement should be managed by both parties in a manner that minimizes adverse impacts to each partyâs customers and to the overall operation of the internet.

**  
Qualifications for Potential Peers**
-----------------------------------------

Lumen will consider settlement-free peering with candidates that meet the following criteria:  
Â 

1. operate an IP network between the interconnection points and utilize Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to govern the exchange of traffic at those interconnection points for all internet traffic, regardless of source, destination or technology used to deliver traffic (including IPv4 and IPv6 internet traffic);
2. have a professionally managed 24x7x365 NOC capable of repairing or otherwise remedying any problems within a reasonable timeframe, cooperating to resolve security incidents, denial of service attacks and other operational issues;
3. must provide 48 hour notice to the Lumen NOC for scheduled maintenance;
4. use the same peering autonomous system (ASN) at each interconnection point and announce a consistent set of routes at each point, unless mutually agreed upon otherwise;
5. filter route announcements from its customers by prefix and using RPKI;
6. not to abuse the peering relationship by engaging in activities such as, but not limited to, pointing a default or static route or otherwise forwarding traffic for destinations not explicitly advertised, resetting next-hop or selling or giving next-hop to others;
7. provide paid internet transit service to at least 1000 unique transit networks (ASNs) utilizing BGP on a global basis, or 250 unique transit networks (ASNs) utilizing BGP on a regional basis where Lumen agrees that peering is limited to interconnection points and traffic that are contained within a single geographic region such as Asia, Europe, Latin America or North America;
8. exchange at a minimum an average of 500 Gbps over the course of a month (in the dominant direction) of internet traffic on a global basis, or at a minimum an average of 250 Gbps (in the dominant direction) of traffic on a regional basis for arrangements where Lumen agrees that peering is limited to interconnection points and traffic that are contained within a single geographic region such as Asia, Europe, Latin America or North America;
9. augment capacity with sufficient lead time to ensure uncongested flow of internet traffic;
10. agree to settlement-free interconnection with Lumen in all primary markets and two-thirds of secondary markets in a given region, as defined by Lumen, not limited to these specified markets (which may include what is considered a home market), regardless of whether Lumen chooses to interconnect in any particular market or region;
11. provide tools (e.g., a public looking glass or route server) to enable diagnosis of the peering relationship and have an up to date PeeringDB record.

  
If after reviewing these requirements, should a candidate network feel these requirements are met or achievable, please send a peering request to:
