General Conditions of Use
=========================

Version dated 08 June 2023
--------------------------

**ARTE G.E.I.E. (hereinafter “ARTE”), the registered office of which is at 4 quai du Chanoine Winterer, 67000 Strasbourg (France) and which is registered at the Strasbourg Trade and Companies Register under the number C 382 865 624, publishes electronic services that are accessible on its websites and using mobile and tablet applications.**

**Definitions:**

For a better understanding of these General Conditions of Use, Users should refer to the following definitions:

“Sites”: means all the electronic services published by ARTE, in their web, mobile and tablet versions, accessible via a wired or wireless network using a browser or an application, irrespective of the means used to access them.

“Content”: means all the audiovisual, textual, sound, graphic and photographic elements of the software, applications, animations and games, etc. available on the Sites, and particularly the Videos offered by means of the Player.

“Player”: means the software developed by and belonging to ARTE, allowing the viewing of the channel’s Live broadcasts and of Videos published by ARTE, on and/or off the Sites using the “Embed” function, and the generation of sharing links using the “Share” function.

“Videos”: means all the audiovisual items offered by means of the Player.

“Live”: means the simultaneous broadcast on the Internet of ARTE’s television signal.

“User”: means any person accessing the Sites regardless of the network or means used.

**Scope of the General Conditions of Use:**

These General Conditions of Use determine the use of all the Sites with the exception of ARTE Boutique, ARTE Magazine, ARTE Radio, ARTE Studio, ARTE Sales, ARTE Pro and EDUC’ARTE, which are subject to different conditions of use.

**Accepting the General Conditions of Use:**

Consultation of the Sites and use of the Content, as well as use of the Player and/or its “Embed” and “Share” functions, whether on or off the Sites, as well as use of the “[MyARTE](https://my.arte.tv/?lang=en#section/landing)” service, are governed by these General Conditions of Use.

The applicable version of the General Conditions of Use is the version in force during each consultation of the Sites and/or use of the Content and services by the User.

ARTE will notify Users that have signed up to “MyARTE” of any modifications of functionalities linked to the “MyARTE” service or these General Conditions of Use (_via_ ARTE’s website and _via_ an e-mail sent to the e-mail address given by the User at the time of the registration on “MyARTE”). Users that do not have a “MyARTE” account will not be notified in advance should the General Conditions of Use be updated in any way. Users are therefore advised to consult the General Conditions of Use regularly so as to be aware of any amendments made thereto and of the version in force at the time of consultation of the Sites and/or use of the Content and services on offer.

In the event that the User is a minor, those with parental authority are responsible for ensuring compliance by the User with these General Conditions of Use. They are legally bound to monitor their child’s use of the Content made available by ARTE.

ARTE reserves the right to make a claim against the User in the event of breach of these General Conditions of Use by the User.

Each point of these General Conditions of Use is valid separately and shall remain valid and applicable independently of the others. The invalidity of any provision or part of these General Conditions of Use will not affect the validity of the other provisions.

**ARTICLE 1 – PURPOSE OF THE SITES**

Among other things, the sites allow the User:

* to consult information relating to the channel, its mission, its programmes and their broadcast
* to view some of the channel’s programmes Live and/or on demand
* to consult pages relating to the channel’s programmes and that are the extension of its activity onto the Internet
* to share certain links by e-mail, on social networks or other sites
* to post comments on the participation areas of the Sites
* to create a “MyARTE” profile in order to see the Videos partially or entirely watched and to create a personalised list of Videos
* to take part in games subject to particular rules

**ARTICLE 2 – ACCESS TO THE SITES**

ARTE grants the User an unrestricted and non-exclusive right of access to all the Sites for the purpose of individual consultation or consultation strictly in the context of the family circle. This right of access allows the User to consult the Sites and to use the Content in the context of these General Conditions of Use.

However, certain services offered on the Sites require the User to register; for example, the publication of comments on the participation areas (see Article 5 below) and the use of “[MyARTE](https://my.arte.tv/?lang=en#section/landing)” accounts.

ARTE is not subject to any performance obligation with regard to the functioning of the Sites and the availability of the Content.

Consequently, the User expressly acknowledges that ARTE may at any time block access to all or part of the Sites or of the Content, particularly by reason of constraints or limitations of a technical or legal nature, without prior notice and at its sole discretion.

**ARTICLE 3 – ACCESS TO CONTENT AND PROTECTION OF MINORS**

As part of its obligation to ensure the protection of minors, ARTE GEIE defines time slots for the provision of age-restricted content and uses an age verification solution published by Yoti – a company whose servers are located in the United Kingdom (for more information please see [Yoti’s confidentiality policy](https://www.yoti.com/privacy/age-verification)) – to enable Users to access content that is prohibited for under-16s and under-18s outside the aforementioned time slots. In order to verify their age, Users must create a MyARTE account and provide themselves with an up-to-date identity document. They will then be asked to scan the document using the camera on their device (computer, mobile phone, etc.). The age verification solution allows the identity document information to be temporarily processed in order to check whether the User is old enough to access age-restricted content.

Once this verification has been completed, no copy or part of your identity document will be retained. The only information that will be recorded is confirmation that you are over or under the required age, in order to avoid the need for further verification.

In the case of minors, once they have reached the age of majority they can use their MyARTE account to re-verify their identity with Yoti, so that it can update their MyARTE profile and enable  them to access all content.

For information on how to exercise your rights, please consult the “[ARTE and your rights](https://www.arte.tv/sites/corporate/en/arte-and-your-personal-data/#yourrights)” section.

**ARTICLE 4 – USE OF THE SITES**

The Sites and the Content are protected by intellectual property rights, and in particular by copyright and trademark law.

The right of access granted to the User (see Article 2) does not include any authorisation to reproduce or represent the Sites or the Content. Accordingly, any reproduction or representation of all or part of the Sites or of the Content, other than in the exceptional legal cases provided by the Intellectual Property Code, without ARTE’s prior written consent, will constitute an act of counterfeiting and may be the subject of a claim in the competent courts.

Users therefore agree, subject to civil and/or criminal penalties for non-compliance, not to reproduce or arrange to reproduce, not to represent or arrange to represent, or adapt, amend, transfer, market, distribute or imitate all or part of the Sites or the Content.

Users accept that ARTE has exclusive editorial control of the Sites and the Content. They expressly acknowledge that ARTE may at any time amend or delete all or part of the Sites or of the Content, without prior notice and at its sole discretion.

The Sites may contain links to other sites or services published by third parties in relation to the Content. ARTE endeavours only to offer the User links to sites or services that are free from anomalies, errors or bugs, but it cannot guarantee that their use will not pose any risk to the User.

Consequently, the use of sites or services published by third parties is excluded from the scope of these General Conditions of Use and shall take place subject to the conditions of use specific to those sites.

The Sites may contain Content that is not appropriate for minors. Persons with parental authority must be aware of this and monitor the use of the Sites by minors under their supervision.

In this context, if a programme is likely to be unsuitable for a young audience, ARTE may warn the User of that programme’s sensitive nature and/or arrange for it to be available on demand between 11pm and 5am only.

**ARTICLE 5 – USE OF THE PLAYER**

ARTE has developed an exportable Player that allows the User to:

* view the channel’s Live broadcasts and the Videos published by ARTE and to choose between the various language versions available
* share certain Videos off the Sites using the “Embed” function
* share part of the Content by e-mail or on social networks using the “Share” function
* temporarily download Videos via the ARTE application

For contractual reasons, ARTE is likely to geolocate access to the Live broadcasts and/or Videos in order to restrict their viewing from certain countries. Bypassing, deactivating or altering the conditions of access is expressly prohibited. For more information on this point, [consult the FAQ](https://www.arte.tv/sites/corporate/nous-repondons-a-vos-questions/).

The Player is protected by copyright as software and must be used in the form supplied by ARTE. Any modification, adaptation, deletion, decompilation or reverse engineering of the Player, its functionalities or its appearance is expressly prohibited without the prior authorisation of ARTE in writing. The Player may also carry “pre-rolls”, short advertising or promotional messages broadcast before the start of the Videos.

In accordance with the contractual provisions agreed with the rights holders, normal use of the Player as authorised by these General Conditions of Use allows the User to view the Live broadcasts and the Videos without the ability to save them permanently. Only a temporary download via the ARTE application is authorised for certain content. Unless stated to the contrary, final and permanent downloading of the Videos offered by means of the Player is not allowed.

Consequently, any saving, regardless of the process or medium used for that purpose, of all or part of the Live broadcasts and/or of the Videos, which is not within the scope of a legal exception provided by the intellectual Property Code, is expressly prohibited without ARTE’s prior authorisation in writing.

In the same way, Users are reminded that editing or making available or communicating to the public any software, application, site, etc., that allows the normal use of the Player to be bypassed, particularly in order to definitively and permanently download all or part of the Direct broadcasts and/or of the Videos, is not allowed.

**5.1 Use of the “Share” function**

The “Share” function allows the User to share links to the pages of the Sites containing Videos by e-mail or on social networks. Users simply have to copy the link generated by the Player and paste it in the e-mail or on the intended site.

**5.2 Use of the “Embed” function**

The “Embed” function allows Users to export certain Videos offered by means of the Player off the Sites. In order to do this, Users must only use the embed code generated by the Player. Any embedding of one or more Videos using another process (framing, etc.) is expressly prohibited.

For contractual reasons, ARTE is likely to geolocate access to the Videos in order to restrict their viewing from certain countries. Thus, only Users with access to the Videos may validly use the “Embed” function to export them off the Sites.

When using the “Embed” function, Users must always ensure that the ARTE logo remains visible and that they do not deactivate the Player’s links to the Sites. Users must not imply that ARTE approves of the site or of the content of sites where the Videos are embedded, that they are in partnership with ARTE or that they are offering privileged access to the Videos.

ARTE reserves the right to block the “Embed” function for sites or services that do not have the necessary authorisation and/or that do not comply with the conditions set out below.

**5.2.1 Conditions of use of the “Embed” function**

Use of the “Embed” function is only allowed if the following conditions are met:

* The purpose of embedding Videos is not to take over the services published by ARTE, whether in full or systematically, or to take over a programme or genre of programme, whether in full or systematically.
* Access to embedded Videos must be provided under the same conditions as on the Sites.
* Users must not make any commercial use of the Player and of the embedded Videos and/or must not benefit from any direct or indirect financial advantage (advertising, sponsorship, subscription, etc.) or compensation of any kind therewith.

Before any use that might fail to satisfy the cumulative conditions set out above, Users are asked to [contact ARTE](mailto:telespectateurs@arte.tv) in order to obtain an authorisation, if necessary.

**5.2.2 “Embed” function destination sites**

Users also undertake not to embed Videos on sites or services in the following categories :

* sites promoting discrimination, hatred or violence on the grounds of gender, presumed race, ethnicity, origin, religion, disability, sexual orientation, political opinions, etc.
* sites infringing personal and property rights and particularly the intellectual property rights of third parties
* sites promoting narcotics or the alcohol, tobacco and arms industries
* sites encouraging the commission of crimes and/or offences
* sites contravening public order and/or infringing public morals
* sites containing comments that are deliberately harmful to the image or reputation of the channel and/or of its programmes and/or of their rights holders

**5.3 Offline mode**

Users can temporarily download certain content available on the ARTE app to watch within 72 hours or less, if the content is available on the app for a shorter period of time. There is no limit to the number of times the Content may be downloaded, but this must be done within the period of its availability on the ARTE app.

**5.4 Indemnities given by the User**

In the event that a third party takes legal action against ARTE as a result of a breach of the conditions of use of the Player by the User that has caused direct or indirect loss to the third party (for example, use of the Player that contravenes these General Conditions of Use and/or infringes the intellectual property rights of a rights holder), the User agrees to indemnify ARTE in proportion to its liability for carrying disputed acts out, in respect of its damages, costs and expenses, including any legal fees and litigation costs that ARTE might be obliged to incur due to that action.

**ARTICLE 6 – USE OF THE PARTICIPATION AREAS**

**6.1 Purpose of the “Participation areas” service**

ARTE makes available to Users participation areas, where they can share their comments regarding the Content of the Sites.

Use of the participation areas is subject to the unreserved acceptance and application of these General Conditions of Use.

Users must certify that they are adults and have legal capacity or, if they are minors, that they have obtained their parents’ or guardians’ authorisation to use the participation areas.

**6.2 Terms of access to the participation areas**

Comments sent in this way will be posted in the participation areas and will be retained for a period of three years unless the User asks for them to be deleted or ARTE decides to remove them for the reasons set out below.

Users are responsible for any misuse and/or for any actions taken using their name or pseudonym. In the event of the misuse of a pseudonym or identity theft of a User, the User undertakes to [inform ARTE](mailto:telespectateurs@arte.tv) without delay.

**6.3 Users’ obligations in the participation areas**

a) Users are responsible for the comments that they post in the participation areas. As such, they undertake, in particular, to comply with the laws and regulations in force, including:

* the rules relating to public order and public morals, particularly the regulations applicable with regard to pornographic and paedophile content.

**6.4 Moderation of the participation areas**

Comments sent by Users are moderated by ARTE according to these General Conditions of Use either before their publication on the participation areas.

ARTE reserves the right, without notifying Users in advance, to delete or not to publish all or part of any comments that contravene these General Conditions of Use or the laws and regulations in force.

ARTE may also temporarily or permanently prohibit all Users’ access to the participation areas.

In addition, Users may also ask ARTE to delete their comments at any time [by sending an e-mail](mailto:telespectateurs@arte.tv), making sure to include the following information: the date of publication, User name or pseudonym and the URL of the participation areas concerned.

**6.5 Users’ responsibilities and guarantees**

Users accept that the comments they post will be made available to the public in the participation areas.

Users guarantee ARTE that they have any authorisation that may be necessary for the publication and/or sharing of the comments that they post on the participation areas, particularly with regard to privacy, right of publicity and property rights and intellectual property law (copyright and trademark law, etc.).

Users acknowledge and accept that the comments that they post on the participation areas are under their entire responsibility and they warrant ARTE against any complaints or claims that might be made against it in relation to the comments that they post.

If Users insert HTML links in the comments that they post, they are responsible for their reliability and compatibility with these General Conditions of Use, including with regard to the Content, products and services, etc. offered on the sites to which those links lead.

**6.6 Participation areas and personal data**

By voluntarily uploading comments to the participation areas of the Sites, Users acknowledge and accept that they will be made accessible to the public on the Sites and that ARTE does not have the technical means to prevent their potential collection and storage by other Users. Their subsequent use off the Sites is in no way controlled by ARTE, who cannot be held liable in that respect.

In order to post a comment, Users must enter their name or user name as well as their e-mail address. ARTE can use the e-mail address provided to contact the User, should their comment breach these General Conditions of Use.

This information is retained on the ARTE servers for a period of three years.

According to the modified French data protection act of 6 January 1978 and the European Union regulation (EU 2016/679) on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (GDPR), Users have a right to data portability of their personal data, a right to access, rectify, oppose, delete, transfer and limit the processing of their data. They can exercise these rights by sending an e-mail to ARTE’s [Data Protection Officer (DPO)](mailto:DPO-ARTE@arte.tv) or a letter to the following address:

ARTE GEIE – DPO/Legal department, 4 quai du Chanoine Winterer, 67000 Strasbourg.

In order to protect Users’ privacy, ARTE may take reasonable steps to verify their identity before giving them access to their personal data or modifying it.

**For practical reasons, if the request is related to a MyARTE account, it must come from the e-mail address used as a login.**

Upon written request, made on paper or electronically, ARTE will inform the User at any moment of the nature of their personal data that ARTE has stored. The sole data that ARTE still needs in order to fulfil its obligations or exercise its rights, as well as the data that the law requires ARTE to retain, is excluded from any deletion.

ARTE is subject to the French and European regulations in relation to personal data and the notices issued by the [French data protection authority (CNIL)](https://www.cnil.fr/en/home), to whom Users can complain.

**6.7 ARTE’s prerogatives and disclaimer**

ARTE reserves the right, at any time and at its sole discretion, to keep online, delete or moderate all or part of the items in the participation areas without having to inform Users in advance and without incurring any liability in that respect.

ARTE assumes no liability for the deletion of comments published in the participation areas of the Sites.

**ARTICLE 7 – USING THE “MYARTE” SERVICE**

**7.1 Purpose of the “[MyARTE](https://my.arte.tv/?lang=en#section/landing)” service**

Users can create personalised accounts, i.e. User profiles, on the ARTE Site. These allow them to add Videos to their favourites, see which Videos they have already watched, subscribe to programmes, take part in competitions and to subscribe to different newsletters.

Using the “MyARTE” service is reserved for Users who are at least 18 years old and have legal capacity. Those with parental authority are responsible for any use of their accounts carried out by their children.

**7.2 Access to the “MyARTE” service**

In order to access the [MyARTE](https://my.arte.tv/?lang=en#section/landing) service it is first necessary to create a User account.

When creating their account, User will be asked to choose a user name – a valid e-mail address – and a password.

Account creation and management is carried out by way of the Single Sign‑on system (hereinafter referred to as SSO). This is used on arte.tv, on the mobile applications, and on the connected television application offered by ARTE. This system allows ARTE to recognise the User on all its digital offers. When Users create an account in MyARTE, they agree to the use of their personal data as detailed below.

In order to complete their registration for the MyARTE service, Users must also confirm their registration by clicking on an authentication link sent by e-mail to their e-mail address (double opt-in).

**7.3 Contests**

Users can participate in contests through their “[MyARTE](https://my.arte.tv/?lang=en#section/landing)” account. Participating in competitions is subject to the prior acceptance of the contest rules, which are available on the contest registration website.

**7.4 “MyARTE” and personal data**

**Cookies**

Users are informed that when they visit their [MyARTE](https://my.arte.tv/?lang=en#section/landing) space, trackers (in particular authentication cookies used to recognise the User’s browser within the ARTE Sites) may be placed and/or read on their terminal equipment, provided that they have expressly consented or when consent is not required by the applicable regulations.

For more information about the cookies used on ARTE pages, see the “[ARTE and cookies](https://www.arte.tv/sites/corporate/en/arte-and-your-personal-data/#cookies)” section.

**Categories of personal data processed**

When Users sign up to the SSO, ARTE collects the following personal data:

* **identification data**: when Users fill in the central sign‑up form: their e-mail address (mandatory), name and forename, postal address and date of birth (optional)
* Metadata: when a User creates an account, certain data (metadata) are retrieved to describe their account. These metadata are essential for the service to work (for example: password, date account was created, IP address used when account was created, date of last login with SSO, date personal data were last modified, etc.)
* data linked to features of the personal page: usage data (favourites, previously‑watched content, etc.),
* Personal Data processed to carry out some one-off actions (e.g. date of birth or postal address in the case of participation in a competition)

ARTE can also find out what content the User has consulted, and to assess that content statistically.

This information helps us to know which pages on ARTE’s Sites are particularly popular, at what times the services are most consulted, and which versions of browser, or which operating systems, are used.

**Purposes**

E-mail addresses are used to manage MyARTE accounts: for identification purposes and to confirm registration, and to send Users their password if it is lost.

If the User consented to receive such information when creating his or her MyARTE account, or on the settings page of his or her MyARTE account, the data collected will be used by ARTE to send personalised communications relating to the User’s consumption habits.

**Recipients**

This data is hosted within the European Union on a secure platform provided by the service providers Cloud IAM (SSO) and SDV (hosting).

User identification data is not transferred to third parties, except:

* If it proves necessary for the proper functioning of ARTE’s services.
* If ARTE is required to do so by law or as a result of a court order.

**Data retention periods**

If registration is not confirmed by clicking on an authentication link sent by e-mail to the User’s e-mail address (double opt-in) the data will be deleted fourteen (14) days after the e-mail wass received.

Unless otherwise requested by the User, data is retained in a form enabling the User to be identified while the account is active.

After twelve (12) months of inactivity, the User will receive an e-mail inviting them to log on within a maximum period of one (1) month. If the User does not respond, his or her data will be definitively deleted from the ARTE database.

**Security measures**

ARTE puts in place technical and organisational security measures to ensure its Users’ personal data is protected against loss, fraudulent alterations and unauthorised access by third parties. Furthermore, only those with authorisation within ARTE are able to access personal data, and only in situations when it is necessary. Data collected when the User signs up is transferred encrypted, as is all subsequent communication between the SSO servers and the ARTE portal.

**Rights of the persons concerned**

At any time, Users can modify some of their information by going to the “MyARTE > My profile” section, or delete their account by going to “MyARTE > My profile > My account > Delete the account”.

According to the modified French data protection act of 6 January 1978 and the European Union regulation (EU 2016/679) on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (GDPR), Users have a right to data portability of their personal data, a right to access, rectify, oppose, delete, transfer and limit the processing of their data. They can exercise this right by sending an e-mail to ARTE’s [Data Protection Officer (DPO)](mailto:DPO-ARTE@arte.tv) or a letter to the following address:

ARTE GEIE – DPO/Legal department, 4 quai du Chanoine Winterer, 67000 Strasbourg.

In order to protect Users’ privacy, ARTE may take reasonable steps to verify their identity before giving them access to their personal data or modifying it.

**For practical reasons, if the request is related to a MyARTE account, it must come from the e-mail address that is used to log in to the account.**

Upon written request, made on paper or electronically, ARTE will inform the User at any moment of the nature of their personal data that ARTE has stored. The sole data that ARTE still needs in order to fulfil its obligations or exercise its rights, as well as the data that the law requires ARTE to retain, is excluded from any deletion.

ARTE is subject to the French and European regulations in relation to personal data and the notices issued by the [French data protection authority (CNIL)](https://www.cnil.fr/), to whom Users can complain.

**ARTICLE 8 –** **NEWSLETTER**

**Newsletter registration procedure**

Users can subscribe for ARTE’s Newsletter either using the link at the bottom of the [www.arte.tv](http://www.arte.tv/) page or when they create a [MyARTE](https://my.arte.tv/?lang=en#section/landing) account.

When subscribing for the Newsletter, Users must provide their e-mail address and agree to these General Conditions of Use and to the cookies that will be deposited as a result.

These cookies enable ARTE to offer personalised communications and/or to track the articles consulted in order to reorient its digital communication strategy. For more information on the cookies used in the context of the Newsletter, Users can go to the “ARTE and cookies” page.

In order to confirm their registration to the Newsletter, Users must click on the authentication link sent to the e-mail address provided (double opt-in).

If Users do not confirm their registration by clicking on the authentication link in the e-mail within a period of fourteen (14) days, their data will be deleted from ARTE’s servers.

Once registered, Users will be sent our weekly Newsletter.

**Content sent**

In addition to the weekly Newsletter, Users may occasionally receive:

* Communications relating to the management of their account and preferences;
* Communications intended to promote certain programmes or events offered by ARTE or its partners (subject to a maximum of two messages per month);
* Optional and anonymous user satisfaction surveys.

**Categories of personal data processed**

In order to send Users a weekly Newsletter and the related communications, ARTE will collect the following personal data:

* Identification data: Users must provide their e-mail address for the purposes of the double opt-in and for ARTE to send them the Newsletter and any communications relating to their registration;
* Metadata: creation of an account requires the collection of certain data (metadata) describing the User’s account. These metadata are essential for the service to work. They include the date of registration, the language in which the Newsletter is to be received, a unique identifier, information as to whether the User has opened the Newsletter, information as to when the Newsletter was opened and information on the User’s browser;
* Reporting data: Users can indicate their preferences with regard to the receipt of programme recommendations.

The opening and use of hyperlinks contained in the Newsletter can be tracked by ARTE to enable it to reorient its digital strategy.

The optional user satisfaction surveys conducted by ARTE using its subcontractor Getfeedback (Usabilla) are anonymous and do not involve the collection of personal data.

**The recipients of data**

ARTE communicates these data internally to the departments that are required to use them in the context of their activities, and to its subcontractor, Brevo.

The data communicated to Brevo may be transferred outside the European Union. In that case, in order to guarantee an adequate level of protection of personal data, ARTE has ensured the existence of tools to secure such transfers.

Except in the case of this subcontractor, Users’ identification data are not transmitted to third parties unless ARTE is obliged to do so by law or by a court decision.

**Data retention periods**

In order to safeguard the interests of Users in the event of prolonged inactivity, ARTE will send Users a reminder e-mail six (6) and then seven (7) months after their last interaction with the Newsletter. If they do not respond, their e-mail address and all their associated data will automatically and definitively be deleted from ARTE’s databases.

Users can unsubscribe from the Newsletter at any time by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of each Newsletter e-mail.

**Security measures**

ARTE also takes technical and operational security measures to ensure that Users’ personal data are protected against loss and against fraudulent alteration or unauthorised access by third parties.

**Rights of the persons concerned**

Users can unsubscribe from the Newsletter at any time by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of each Newsletter e-mail.

In accordance with the French Data Protection Law of 6 January 1978, as amended, and Regulation (EU 2016/679) on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (GDPR), Users have a right to access, rectify, oppose, delete and limit the processing of their data, as well as a right to the portability of their personal data. For more information, please refer to the section “[**ARTE and your rights**](https://www.arte.tv/sites/corporate/en/arte-and-your-personal-data/#yourrights)”.

In order to protect Users’ privacy, ARTE may take reasonable measures to verify their identity before giving them access to their personal data or allowing them to make changes.

**For practical reasons, if the request relates to a MyARTE account, it must be made from the e-mail address used as the user name**.

If so requested in writing either by letter or e-mail, ARTE will inform the User at any time of the nature of his or her personal data stored by ARTE. The only data that cannot be deleted are those still required by ARTE to fulfil its obligations or to exercise its rights, as well as data that it is required to keep by law.

ARTE is subject to the French and European legislation on personal data and to notices issued by the French data protection authority (CNIL), to which Users can make complaints.

**ARTICLE 9 – LIMITATION OF WARRANTY AND OF LIABILITY**

**9.1 Responsibility of the User and ARTE in general**

By using the Sites or the Content, Users warrant that they have the appropriate abilities, equipment and software to use the Sites and the Content and, more generally, the Internet, without risk.

Users are fully aware and bear the consequences of the characteristics of the Internet and its use, and in particular of the limitations associated with technical performance, response times and the risks associated with the security of communications.

ARTE will not be liable to compensate intangible and/or tangible losses suffered by Users and/or third parties of any kind and for which it has not been proven that actions on ARTE’s part were the cause.

**9.2 Site, Content and Internet malfunctioning; Interruptions**
