* #### 7\. Service Fees
    

Cloudinary offers some of its plans free of charge.

Cloudinary also offers fee-based plans. You may use them subject to purchasing one of the Service’s plans, as listed in Cloudinary’s website at: [**https://cloudinary.com/pricing**](https://cloudinary.com/pricing). From time to time, Cloudinary may change the Services fees, upon reasonable prior notice that Cloudinary will post on its website or send you by email.

You may pay the fees by using the methods of payments as available, published and updated from time to time on the Services. Fees will be regarded as paid only after your payment has been confirmed. The Services will be available to you promptly after you have paid the Service fees. You acknowledge that fees are not refundable.

Payments will include applicable taxes and you are responsible for all taxes, including sales tax where applicable. You will pay all fees and taxes in a timely manner and in compliance with Cloudinary’s pricing schedule and you will reimburse Cloudinary for any interest and collection costs resulting from overdue payments. All invoices will be sent digitally.

Cloudinary will make its best efforts to have a transaction processed accurately and expeditiously and reimburse you for any excess payment that you were mistakenly charged with. However, Cloudinary will not be liable for mistakes, errors, malfunctions and miscalculations made by the payment service providers.

Upon failure to make any payment, and following a seven (7) days prior notice of due payments sent to you, Cloudinary may remove, disable or terminate your account. You waive any and all claims against Cloudinary and anyone on Cloudinary’s behalf in connection therewith. If an invoiced amount is not received by Cloudinary by its due date, then, without derogating from any other remedies available to it, Cloudinary may charge a late payment interest at a rate of 1.5% of the unpaid amount per month, or, if lower, the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, and shall be entitled to reasonable expenses incurred (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) in connection with the collection of an overdue payment.

If you acquire our Services from an authorized distributor or reseller and not directly from us, your fee obligations will be instead to such distributor or reseller, in which case we will provide you with the Services subject to: (i) your compliance with such fee obligations towards such distributor or reseller, (ii) your agreement with such distributor or reseller being in effect, and (iii) such distributor or reseller being in compliance with its obligations to us. Unless agreed by us separately and directly in writing towards you or such distributor or reseller, none of the terms of any agreement that you may have with such distributor or reseller will derogate from our rights and your obligations under these Terms.

* #### 8\. Service Level Agreement (SLA)
    

Cloudinary strives for a 100% Uptime. “Uptime” means the percentage of time in a subscription month that Cloudinary’s management console and Cloudinary’s API services are available for access, as measured by Cloudinary.

Information about our support plans can be found here: [**https://cloudinary.com/pricing/support-plans**](https://cloudinary.com/pricing/support-plans). Cloudinary’s support SLA is your sole and exclusive remedy for any failure by Cloudinary to provide the Services.

* #### 9\. Intellectual Property
    

As between you and Cloudinary, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, you own and  retain all rights in any Contributed Content. You acknowledge that you are responsible to make sure you have all sufficient copyrights and Intellectual Property rights to the Contributed Content, including for ensuring that it does not violate any third party’s rights, applicable law or these Terms.

Unless as expressly provided herein, these Terms do not grant you any rights to patents, copyrights, trademarks (whether registered or unregistered), trade names, trade secrets, domain names or any other rights, functions or licenses with respect to the Services and you may not use the Services for any other purpose without Cloudinary’s prior, express written authorization.

However, you grant Cloudinary permission to use your Contributed Content, for the purposes of providing, developing and supporting the Services. You grant Cloudinary permission to use your Company name and logo in Cloudinary website and any Cloudinary issued publications. If you wish to decline Cloudinary’s use of your name and logo, please contact Cloudinary at: [**support@cloudinary.com**](mailto:support@cloudinary.com). You acknowledge that Cloudinary may adjust and modify Contributed Content, per your requests.

If you use the Services for generating any type of materials or output, including images and video files, such output will be deemed as part of your Contributed Content, and is subject to these Terms, including our Acceptable Use Policy.

“Confidential Information” means any information furnished or made available by one party to the other, that is identified as “confidential” or “proprietary,” either by legend on written or electronically stored material, or which ought reasonably to be recognized as confidential or proprietary by virtue of its nature or the circumstances of its disclosure. The foregoing will not be considered as Confidential Information of a party: (a) is or becomes available to the public through no breach of the receiving party; (b) was rightfully known without restriction on use or disclosure prior to such information being disclosed or made available to the receiving party; or (c) is received from a third party entitled to disclose such information without restriction.

Each of you and Cloudinary will take precautions to maintain the confidentiality of the other party’s Confidential Information with the same degree of care as to its own Confidential Information, but in no case less than reasonable care. Upon termination of these Terms, either party will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete all copies of the other’s Confidential Information that is stored on its system or in its possession, except for retaining data for legitimate business purposes or as required under applicable laws, including under tax related requirements, account settling, record keeping, archiving and legal issues.

If Cloudinary is compelled by law, a competent court or government action, to disclose the other party’s confidential information, Cloudinary shall furnish only such portion of the Confidential Information which is legally required, and shall exercise all reasonable efforts to obtain confidential treatment for such information.
