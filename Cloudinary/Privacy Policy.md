### Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies

We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to make sure that our Service is continuously improved and meets your needs. Please view our [Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies Policy](https://cloudinary.com/privacy/cookie-policy).

We also use standard analytics tools such as Google Analytics, to learn about how you and other users use the Service, in support of our Service-related activities and operations. The privacy practices of these tools are subject to their own privacy policies and they use their own cookies to provide their services.

As part of our business and Services operations, we de-identify Personal Information and use the data in a statistical and aggregated form. We will share it with our partners, affiliates and other third parties for legitimate business purposes. We make considerable efforts to ensure that such data is unlikely to identify you or be associated specifically with you.

### Your Choice

If personal data covered by this Privacy Policy is to be used for a new purpose that is materially different from that for which the personal data was originally collected or subsequently authorized, or is to be disclosed to a third party in a manner not described in this Policy, we will provide you with an opportunity to choose whether to have your personal data so used or disclosed. Requests to opt out of such uses or disclosures of personal data should be sent to us to [privacy@cloudinary.com](mailto:privacy@cloudinary.com).

Further, we provide you with choice and control on how we use Personal Information in connection with various aspect of our processing, as follows:

Please contact us at [privacy@cloudinary.com](mailto:privacy@cloudinary.com) if you would like to stop receiving our newsletter or marketing emails.

At any time, you can unsubscribe from our mailing lists or newsletters by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails or by accessing our [unsubscribe page](http://info.cloudinary.com/UnsubscribePage.html).

You can manage your preferences related to use of cookies and similar technologies on our Services by following the instructions in our [Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies Policy](https://cloudinary.com/privacy/cookie-policy).

At any time, you can stop using the Services. Termination of your Cloudinary’s Services account is subject to the terms of your subscription agreement with us and the Terms of Use.

Some internet browsers offer a “do not track” or “DNT” signals to indicate your preference for tracking your activities on a service or through cross-site online activities. These features are varied with no uniform or common standard adopted yet by industry groups or regulators. Therefore, our Services do not currently respond to DNT signals. We continue to monitor developments around DNT technology and the implementation of a standard.

### Accessing Personal Information

If you find that the information on your account is inaccurate, incomplete or not up-to-date, please contact us at: [privacy@cloudinary.com](mailto:privacy@cloudinary.com) and provide us with the necessary information to correct it.

At any time, you can contact us at: [privacy@cloudinary.com](mailto:privacy@cloudinary.com) and request to access the Personal Information that we keep about you. We will ask you to provide us certain credentials to make sure that you are who you claim to be and to as required under applicable law, we will make good-faith efforts to locate the Personal Information that you request to access and provide you with a copy.

Following your review of the Personal Information you can request to correct, amend or delete Personal Information, if it is inaccurate, incomplete or not up-to-date, or if you believe that the processing of the Personal Information is in violation of applicable law.

We will use discretion and due care to redact from the data which we will make available to you, personal information related to others. Where you believe that content containing Personal Information was uploaded to our Services by a third-party user, please contact such user who uploaded that content with a request to remove Personal Information.

### Data Retention

We retain Personal Information for different periods of time, depending on the purposes for processing the information, our legitimate business purposes, and pursuant to legal requirements under the applicable law.

For example, we will need to keep the information about your payment transactions for several years due to tax related requirements, for accounts settling, record keeping, archiving and legal issues.

We will maintain your contact details to help us stay in contact with you. At any time before or after the termination of your account, you can contact our privacy team at: [privacy@cloudinary.com](mailto:privacy@cloudinary.com) and request to delete your contact details. Note that we keep your details for the necessary period of time for legal requirements and proceedings, if and when necessary.

Content uploaded to the Services such as images, videos, text, graphics or tags, and any data which is contained in such content will be deleted following the termination or deactivation of your subscription to the Services, and Cloudinary will not be responsible for any backup or retention of your content. However, the logs which indicate your access to such data and are used to create metrics for usage and billing, such as CDN logs, will be retained to allow you to resubscribe to the Services.

We will keep aggregated non-identifiable information without limitation, and to the extent reasonable we will delete or de-identify potentially identifiable information, when we no longer need to process the information in an identifiable form.

In any case, as long as you use the Service, we will keep information about you, unless the law requires us to delete it, or if we decide to remove it at our discretion, according to the terms of this policy.

### Transfer of Personal Information

We use AWS servers located either in the United States or in the European Union, depending on your location, and provide enterprise customers with the ability to restrict the hosting of their data to the European Economic Area (EEA). We process and access information, either directly or by using third parties such as data hosting service providers, in the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, Singapore and Israel. The laws of these territories may differ from the laws of the jurisdiction in which you live or conduct your business.

We make sure that our third-party service providers provide us with adequate confidentiality and security commitments and we take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that Personal Information related to you is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.

If you are a resident in a jurisdiction where transfer of Personal Information to another jurisdiction requires your consent, then your consent to this Privacy Policy means that you expressly and unambiguously consent also to such transfer of Personal Information. If our use of the Personal Information is governed by laws restricting the transfer of personal information to other countries that do not provide an adequate level of protection to the Personal Information, we will use appropriate safeguards, in particular, by way of entering into appropriate contractual agreements with the relevant recipients, or by adhering to equivalent data transfer regulations to protect the security and confidentiality of such personal information.

If mandated by law, you can obtain a copy of the suitable safeguards that we use when transferring personal information as described above or receive further information about the transfers by contacting us at: [privacy@cloudinary.com](mailto:privacy@cloudinary.com).

Please submit your request to us by sending an email to our privacy team at: [privacy@cloudinary.com](mailto:privacy@cloudinary.com).

We will make an effort to verify the identity of your authorized agent and will not share Personal Information with your authorized agent without receiving the signed permission and verifying the identity of your authorized agent.

A request for access can be made by you only twice within a 12-month period.

Any disclosures that we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding receipt of your request.

The response we provide will also explain the reasons for our inability to comply with your request, if applicable.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.  If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will inform you of the reasons for such decision and provide you with a cost estimate before processing further your request.
