### 2\. WHAT PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT, HOW WE COLLECT IT AND WHAT WE DO WITH THE COLLECTED PERSONAL DATA

  
  

#### 2.1. Creating your account

When the Visitors of our Website [sign-up](https://shortpixel.com/free-sign-up) for a ShortPixel account, we collect their email, their IP address and store the new generated API keys.  
The legal ground for this Processing is the performance of a contract, in accordance with Art. 6 (1) b) GDPR.  
  

#### 2.2. Running the Services

We Process the Personal Data for taking the necessary actions to offer our Customers the Company’s products (e.g. for the proper running of our Web Hosting service and of our image optimization service, to connect our servers to our Customers’ servers, where the images needing compression are hosted, for maintenance and for building appropriate tools for our clients, etc.), pursuant to Art. 6 (1) b) GDPR, for the performance of a contract and Art. 6 (1) f) GDPR, on the basis of our legitimate interest.  
From the Users of our WordPress plugins and from those who use our API tools, we Process the following Personal Data: name and surname, identification data, email, processed images and CDN traffic data.  
From the Customers of Web Hosting service we Process the following Personal Data: name and surname, identification data, email, domain name.  
We also process data regarding the browser, IP address, timestamp, IP location and also operating system when you access ShortPixel Hosting or any web site that is owned by ShortPixel.  
All the information that is so collected is used for secure logging & website data analytics and preventing fraud.  
  
  
2.2.1. Google Drive optimization app  
This service is curently in beta testing.  
We offer our users the possibilty to optimize their images stored in Google Drive, from their personal space on our website.  
In order to optimize these images, the user needs to create an account with ShortPixel.com. Then the ShortPixel website Google Drive optimization application needs to be allowed access to the users Google Drive in order to view, download, upload, modify, add files as a different file type at your request or overwrite files.  
In order to aquire this permission, upon the first usage, the logged-in ShortPixel user will be asked to connect their account to the Google Drive Account, using Google OAuth 2.0 (note that the email used to register the ShortPixel account can be different from the one of the Google Account).  
Since optimization may take a while, the app needs offline access to your Google Drive Account, and, as consequence, it requests your consent for Refresh Token, which allows the app to continuously access your Google Drive Account while you are not present in the app. After the authorization, ShortPixel will only store the Refresh Token (provided by Google OAuth 2.0) in order to communicate with Google OAuth 2.0 and access users files from Google Drive.  
After user grants access to the application, the user can browse the content of their Google Drive from their private space on ShortPixel.com and select the folder for optimization by using the contextual menu of the app. When the user selects a folder for optimization, the name and ID of that folder are stored in the ShortPixel's optimization queue to be processed in the background.  
Upon optimization, the application first downloads the content of the Google Drive folder to the ShortPixel servers, filtered by accepted file types and starts optimizing them. "Filtered by accepted file types" means only files of the following types will be downloaded: JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, PDF. After the optimization is complete on ShortPixel's cloud, the application uploads the optimized files back to Google Drive, overwriting the old files or adding it as a different file type at your request. Files are then deleted from ShortPixel servers and the user receives an email - at their address from their ShortPixel account - letting them know that the optimization is done.  
The statistics of the folder optimization (folder name, number of files - total, optimized, already optimal, failed - and the optimization percent) are kept in ShortPixel's database and used for future reference.  
Please be aware that Refresh Token allows the app to continuously access your Google Drive Account while you are not present in the app and it expires after 6 months. If you don’t want to permit the app to access your Google Drive after optimization, you must revoke the access here or delete your ShortPixel account.
