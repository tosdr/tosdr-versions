**11.3. Limits in use**  
11.3.1. Fair Usage Policy of ShortPixel Hosting: ShortPixel Hosting offers hosting plans bundled with limited and unlimited resources like disk space and/or other resources, such as data transfer, databases etc. The use of the Service is governed by a Fair Usage Policy, stated below, which covers the fair use of bandwidth and other resources where there is an indication of "unmetered/unlimited" data transfer or storage capacity, in order to prevent Service abuse and allowing the Company to fully optimize network capacity, as well as maintain the quality of the Services.  
If a website is identified to consume too many resources, we will try to contact the User (owner) to discuss possible solutions. Until such solutions shall be implemented, the use of the Service can be limited at the discretion of the Company.  
Disk space is intended for use in accordance with ShortPixel Hosting’s Fair Use Policy and limited to web files, active email and User Website content only. Shared hosting space may not be used for storage, including without limitation, of media, emails, as offsite storage of electronic files, or FTP hosts. ShortPixel expressly reserves the right to review every shared account for excessive usage of CPU, disk space and other resources that may be caused by a violation of this Agreement or the Fair Use Policy. ShortPixel may, in its sole discretion, terminate access to the Services, apply additional fees, or remove or delete User Content for those accounts that are found to be in violation of ShortPixel's T&C.  
Excessive Server Resources: Use of ShortPixel’s resources must be consistent with a shared hosting environment and must otherwise comply with this T&C. Accounts with a large number of files can have an adverse effect on server performance. Similarly, accounts with an excessive number of database tables or an excessive database size negatively affect the performance of the server. In the event that you exceed these amounts, ShortPixel may request that you reduce the number of files/inodes, database tables, or total databases to ensure optimal server performance. ShortPixel reserves the right to terminate your account, with or without notice, for excessive use of resources that result in a degradation of server performance or the Services.

The Unlimited Plan is intended for personal use only and is subjected to the Fair Use Policy. Sometimes a single website can take up more than 5% of our Image Optimization Cloud capacity by using (but not limited to) huge images (over 10K pixels width/height), manipulated images designed to artificially load the system, or many images that require a lot of CPU processing power for being generated/optimized (e.g. WebP/AVIF). We consider such usage as unreasonable and abnormal, and affecting our Services. If a website is identified to consume too many resources, we will try to contact the User (owner) to discuss possible solutions and, until such solutions shall be implemented, the use of ShortPixel Image Optimization Cloud will be limited.  
11.3.3. Visitors may post reviews, comments or other content on the Website as well as other communications and submit suggestions, ideas, comments, questions or other information, so long as the content is not illegal, obscene, discriminatory, racist, containing hate speech or similar, threatening, defamatory, invasive of privacy, infringing on intellectual property rights or otherwise injurious to third parties or objectionable and does not consist of or contain software viruses, political campaigning, commercial solicitation, chain letters, mass mailings or any form of "spam".
