This Cookies Policy (the “**Policy**”) applies to you as a visitor of www.shortpixel.com (the “**Website**”) and offers an overview on the manner in which we may place and manage cookie files in connection with your use of our Website.

#### 1\. What is a “cookie”?

A cookie is an alphanumeric identifier (a file) that the Website transfers to your computer's hard drive through a web browser to enable its systems to recognize your browser for record-keeping purposes.

The Company uses both session ID cookies and persistent cookies as part of its interaction with your browser. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser, while a persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.

Certain cookies are set by us and called first-party cookies. We also use cookies which are placed by means of third parties (i.e. third-party cookies, such as Google). You may find, in Section 4 below, details on the types of cookies we are using.

#### 2\. What role do cookies play?

Cookies are used for purposes such as providing a better browsing experience on the Website, by identifying any errors that occur while visiting it. Once those errors are fixed, there will be an improvement in the efficiency and accessibility of the Website for you as a visitor.

Also, cookies enable retargeting and creating targeted audience groups, thus enabling us to provide you with content and services which are tailored to your needs.

Moreover, ShortPixel is using cookies for ensuring a more personal character for the Website as well as to offer you an easier browsing experience through functions such as recognizing you when you return to our Website or anticipating services that should be provided in the future. These functionalities are possible based on anonymous statistics on how the Website is used, number of visitors and preferred pages.

#### 3\. How can you change your cookies selection?

The first time you access the Website, you will be informed on the use of cookies and you will be granted the option to agree with the use of cookies and to choose the types of cookies you want to accept. Please note that you may exert your option regarding the use of cookies only in relation to the optional ones. In what regards the necessary cookies, these are essential for the adequate functionality of the Website, therefore cannot be disabled.

You may select the categories of cookies you want to permit by ticking the relevant boxes and confirm your option by pressing “Confirm”. Please note that if you decline the use of cookies, you may not be able to use certain features on this site and you may be required to re-enter the information necessary to complete an order during new or interrupted browser sessions.
