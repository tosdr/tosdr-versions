Filestack Service Terms
=======================

These Filestack Service Terms (these “**Service Terms**“) are between Filestack, Inc., (“**Filestack**“) and the person who submits an Order for Filestack’s services on the Filestack Site or who signs an Order that incorporates these terms by reference to the URL where they are posted (“**you**“).

Capitalized words in these Service Terms have special meanings as stated in the section where they are first used, or as defined in [Section 9](https://www.filestack.com/terms/#section9) (Definitions).

Filestack may modify these Services Terms at any time, but modifications are not effective for Orders that are in place prior to the modification until the Order renews or you add new services to your account. See the [Section 8.22](https://www.filestack.com/terms/#section8-22) (Changes to Online Service Terms).

If you have any questions about these Services Terms, please contact us:

The license may not be assigned or transferred except as part of an assignment of the Agreement that is permitted by these Terms of Service. Your license is worldwide, subject to export restrictions stated in the Agreement and applicable export laws. Filestack may terminate your license in accordance with the termination provisions applicable to the Agreement stated below.

**1.3 Phone Support and SLAs**. Unless expressly included as part of your plan or expressly stated in your Order for custom Services, the Services do not include phone support or any service level commitments around response times or availability. If you would like phone support and an SLA, you may upgrade your plan on the customer portal or by contacting [sales@filestack.com](mailto:sales@filestack.com).

**1.4 Fraud Check**. Filestack may refuse to provide Services if you fail its fraud check. If you fail the fraud check after your account has been provisioned, Filestack will close your account, and refund any pre-paid fees.

You may use the Filestack Technology as part of a revenue-generating application service that includes your own application, but you may not resell the Filestack Technology on a stand-alone basis.

**1.5.6 Medical Devices/High Risk Use**. You may not use the Filestack Technology, or permit any other person to use the Filestack Technology in any situation where failure or fault of the Filestack Technology could lead to death or serious bodily injury of any person, or to physical or environmental damage. For example, you may not use the Filestack Technology as a component of or to operate any medical device or in connection with any aircraft or other mode of human transportation, or nuclear or chemical facilities.

**1.5.7 Modifications**. You may not modify or create derivative works of the Service except as expressly permitted by [Section 8.1](https://www.filestack.com/terms/#section8-1) (Look and Feel).

**1.5.8 Competing Services**. You may not access the Filestack Technology for the purpose of creating a competing service.

**1.6 Demonstration/Free Trial**. Demonstration features on the Site and free trial services are not “Services” under this Agreement, and are provided **AS IS**, without any warranties or representations whatsoever. Filestack has no obligation to provide support for any demonstration feature or free trial services. Any support that is provided is provided on an **AS IS** and **AS AVAILABLE** basis, and Filestack has no liability for any harm or damage arising out of or in connection with your use of a demonstration or free trial service. Filestack may terminate any demonstration or free trial services and delete your files and related information at any time.

**1.7 Beta Services**. Filestack may invite you to test “Beta” services at no charge. Beta services will be designated as test, beta, pilot, limited release, developer preview, non-production, evaluation or with a similar description. Beta services are for evaluation purposes and not for production use, are not considered “Services” under this Agreement, are not supported, and may be subject to additional terms. Filestack may terminate a Beta service at any time, for any or no reason. Filestack may discontinue Beta Services at any time in its sole discretion and may never make the Beta Services generally available. If a generally available version is released, there may not be an automatic update path from the Beta version to the generally available version. If not earlier terminated, any Beta services trial period will expire on the date that the Beta service is released on a generally available basis. Beta Services are provided **AS IS**, and Filestack has no liability for any harm or damage arising out of or in connection with a Beta Service.

**1.8 Third Party Services**. If you purchase AWS S3 storage directly from Filestack, your use of the storage is subject to the AWS terms at [https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/legal-reseller/AWS+Reseller+Customer+License+Terms.pdf](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/legal-reseller/AWS+Reseller+Customer+License+Terms.pdf). If you purchase CDN services directly from Filestack, your use of the CDN services is subject to the conditions, restrictions, disclaimers and limitations stated in the Fastly terms at [https://www.fastly.com/terms](https://www.fastly.com/terms). As between you and Filestack, all third party services are provided AS IS, and Filestack makes no representation or warranty whatsoever regarding any third party service that you purchase through Filestack.

**1.10 Integration Features**. Filestack may provide integration features that enable you to interact with your third party service providers such as Dropbox, Google, Facebook, and Instagram. Filestack does not endorse or redomend any service for which it offers an integration feature. You acknowledge that Filestack’s integration features may be unavailable or may not work properly if the service provider’s API is unavailable or if the service provider modifies its API or services in a way that impacts the Filestack integration feature. Filestack will use commercially reasonable efforts to modify its integration features to maintain compatibility with service provider’s APIs and services, but may discontinue an integration feature without liability to you if there is a change in the service that creates an unreasonable cost or operational burden to Filestack. Your obligations under the Agreement, for fees and otherwise, are not conditioned on the continued availability of any integration features. Your use of the third party service is subject to the legal agreement between you and the third party. You should review the third party’s legal terms and privacy policies before using their services.

2\. YOUR CONTENT
----------------

The content that you or your users transmit, modify, or store using the Services is “Your Content.” As between you and Filestack, you own and retain ownership and all rights in Your Content and Filestack may use Your Content only for the purpose of providing the Services and exercising its legal rights and remedies in connection with the Agreement. For clarity, “Your Content” does not include: (i) system generated data about your use of the Services (“**System Data**“) provided that the System Data is not identifiable to you or any user, or (ii) any numerical or financial data about your users that is collected and maintained in aggregate anonymous form (“**Anonymous Statistical Data**“). You acknowledge that Filestack owns and retains ownership rights in the System Data and Anonymous Statistical Data and may use, transfer, and commercially exploit the System Data and Anonymous Statistical Data for any purpose whatsoever.

3\. FEES AND PAYMENTS
---------------------

**3.1 Payment Account**. Unless you have made other arrangements with Filestack, you must authorize and maintain a current valid means for Filestack to collect its fees for the Services via payment card, PayPal, or ACH at all times during the Term.

**3.2 Billing Cycle**. Fees are charged on a monthly basis unless otherwise stated in the Order. Your “billing cycle” begins on your Services activation date and continues for one month. For example, if your Services are activated on January 15, your first billing cycle will begin on January 15th and end on February 14, and your billing cycles will continue from the 15th of each month to the 14th of the following month for the Term of your Order. If your service activation date is the 29th, 30th or 31th day of a month, your billing cycle will end on the last day of the calendar month that has fewer days than your service activation month. For example, if your service activation date is January 31th, your billing cycles will end on February 28, March 31, April 30, etc.

**3.3 Fees**. The fees for the Services are stated in your Order, either directly or by reference to a plan description on the Filestack site or customer portal. Filestack may not increase the fees during your initial term, but may increase its fees for any renewal term by giving you notice of the increase at least thirty (30) days prior to the first day of the first billing cycle or the renewal term. If you exceed any account limits applicable to your Services plan, Filestack will charge you overages at its then-current published overage rates, except if you have free plan, Filestack will not charge you but may block your Service until the start of the next billing cycle. Fees are stated and must be paid in United States Dollars.

**3.4 Sales Tax**. The stated fees do not include any sales, use, VAT or like taxes (“Sales Tax”). You must pay any applicable Sales Tax that is properly invoiced by Filestack.

**3.5 Invoices**. Filestack may invoice the fees on or before the following times: (i) for one-time fees (such as set up fees), the day you submit the Order that includes the fee, and (ii) for monthly fees, monthly in advance. Filestack may invoice any applicable Sales Tax with the invoice for the related Service, or separately. If your Order includes a monthly fee that is stated as a “minimum,” Filestack may invoice the minimum on or after the first day of your billing cycle, and invoice any amount by which your usage based fee exceeds the minimum on or after the last day of your billing cycle.

**3.6 Payments**. Unless you have made other arrangements, Filestack may charge your payment card or account on the date of invoice. Filestack may suspend or terminate your Services or the Order if its charge to your payment card or account is rejected or not timely paid for any reason. Filestack may charge interest on overdue amounts at the lesser of 1.2% per month or the highest non-usurious amount permitted by applicable law. If Filestack takes legal action to collect an overdue amount, you must also pay Filestack’s reasonable costs of collection, such as attorney fees and court costs. If Filestack suspends your account for late payment, you must pay Filestack’s reasonable reinstatement fee, not to exceed the minimum or base fee of your Plan.

**3.7 Plan Changes**. If you have purchased a Filestack plan, you may upgrade your plan at any time by placing an upgrade Order. Generally, changes to your plan are effective starting with the billing cycle that follows the change. For upgrades, Filestack may give you the benefit of additional features prior to the next billing cycle, but you will be charged the fees applicable to your old plan for the remainder of the billing cycle. If you downgrade or cancel your Services, Filestack may continue your existing plan features and fees until your next billing cycle, or may change your plan to the lower tier or terminate your Services prior to the end of the billing cycle, at its election.

**3.8 General**. Fees are non-refundable, even if you do not use the Services. If your Order is for an initial term of longer than one month, and the Order is terminated prior to the end of the initial term then, unless the termination was by Filestack for convenience, or by you for Filestack’s breach, you must pay an early termination fee equal to the fees for the remaining part of the initial term.

4\. YOUR OBLIGATIONS
--------------------

**4.1 Fees**. You must pay your fees when due as described above. You must not use or attempt to use the Services in a way that undermines Filestack’s ability to correctly calculate its fees.

**4.2 Your Security Obligations**. You must use reasonable security precautions in connection with your use of the Services, such as requiring your personnel and users to establish reasonably secure passwords and using commercially reasonable efforts to protect your systems and data from malware. You may not interfere, or attempt to interfere, with any encryption features of the Services. You must use signatures and policies to prevent unauthorized access and use of Services as described in [https://www.filestack.com/docs/security/policies](https://www.filestack.com/docs/security/policies). You agree that you are responsible under the Agreement for any action taken using your account credentials, even if the action was not authorized by you.

**4.3 Authorized Users**. You authorize Filestack to act on the instructions of a user who authenticates using the account credentials you have established. You are solely responsible for maintaining the user permissions and authentication credentials for your account. You may not authorize anyone to use the administrative features of your Services account other than your employees and individual contractors under your direct supervision.

**4.4 Acceptable Use**. You may not use the Services or permit your users to use the Services in violation of the AWS Acceptable Use Policy at [https://aws.amazon.com/aup/](https://aws.amazon.com/aup/), or in connection with any illegal or abusive activities, as determined by Filestack in its reasonable discretion.

**4.5 Backups**. You must create a backup of Your Content at reasonable intervals and retain that backup in a secure location.

**4.6 Compliance with Law**. You must use the Services in compliance with applicable law, including export laws as further detailed in [Section 7.9](https://www.filestack.com/terms/#section7-9) (Export Compliance).

**4.7 Representations and Warranties**. You represent and warrant to Filestack as of the effective date of each Order and on an ongoing basis that: (i) the information you submit about yourself and your activities to establish a Services account with Filestack and place an Order is true, correct, and complete, (ii) you have not been the target of any legal or regulatory investigations or proceedings in connection with your business activities, (iii) Your Content was collected in accordance with applicable law, and that you have all necessary rights and authority to use and process Your Content as contemplated by the Agreement, including any required consents from individuals under applicable privacy laws, and (iv) each third party service provider with whom you interface using the Filestack API has given you any permissions or licenses that may be required for the interface.

5\. TERM, TERMINATION, SUSPENSION
---------------------------------

**5.1 Term**. Unless otherwise stated in your Order, the initial term of each Order begins on Order submission and continues until the end of your first billing cycle (one month from your Services activation date). On expiration of the initial term, the Order renews for consecutive renewal terms of one month each (or any longer period described in the Order), unless either you or Filestack gives a notice of non-renewal on or before the last day of the initial term or then current renewal term, as applicable.

**5.2 Termination**. Either party may terminate an Order, or the Agreement, on written notice if the other party is in material violation of any term of an Order or these Service Terms, provided that if the violation is curable the terminating party must first give the other party a written notice describing the violation in reasonable detail and at least ten (10) days to cure the violation. You may terminate an Order at any time for convenience effective as of the last day of your billing cycle by giving notice on or before the last day of the billing cycle, subject to your obligation to pay any applicable early termination fee as described above in Fees and Payments/General. Filestack may terminate an Order at any time for convenience on thirty (30) days advance written notice. Filestack may terminate an Order and the Agreement at any time on summary written notice if you or your personnel are abusive to Filestack personnel.

**5.3 Suspension**. Filestack may suspend your access to the Services and Your Content during any period that you are in material breach of the Agreement or your access to the Services or Your Content creates a material security vulnerability. Filestack will give you at least two (2) business days’ advance notice of the suspension, unless the suspension is made under emergency circumstances. Filestack will reinstate your access to the Services when the grounds for suspension are cured unless Filestack has already terminated the Agreement as described in this Section.

**5.4 Surviving Provisions**. The following sections survive expiration or termination of the Agreement: Fees and Payment, Confidentiality, Indemnification, Limitation of Liability, Term and Termination, Suspension, Governing Law, Disputes, Notices, General, and any other terms that by their nature are intended to survive expiration or termination.

**5.5 Return of Your Content**. You are responsible for exporting Your Content from the Services prior to expiration of the Agreement. If Filestack terminates your Services for breach, Filestack will retain Your Content for at least 15 days from the effective date of termination. If you wish to export Your Content following a termination for breach, Filestack will either, at its option, enable short term access to the Services at a scheduled time so that you may export Your Content, or export Your Content using its standard export tools. Filestack has no obligation to retain Your Content after the 15-day period and may destroy Your Content.

6\. REMEDIES, DISCLAIMERS, INDEMNIFICATION, LIMITATIONS
-------------------------------------------------------

**6.1 Warranty/SLA**. Filestack’s Services warranties are stated in [Section 1](https://www.filestack.com/terms/#section1). If you purchase an enterprise plan, the Order may include additional warranties or a Service Level Agreement (“**SLA**“).

**6.2 SLA/Warranty Remedies**.

**6.2.1 SLA**. If your Order includes an SLA with credit remedies, the credits are the sole and exclusive remedy for failure to meet the service commitments for which the credits are provided.

**6.2.2 Warranty**. If the Services fail to meet a warranty stated in the Agreement other than an SLA, Filestack will attempt to cure the failure or if it is unable to cure the failure through commercially reasonable efforts it will refund the fees paid for the billing cycle during which the failure occurred. However, to be eligible for a warranty remedy under this section, you must give a written notice describing the failure no later than ten (10) days following the end of the billing cycle and cooperate with Filestack’s reasonable efforts to cure the failure. The remedies stated in this Section are your **sole and exclusive** remedy for Filestack’s warranty breach.

**6.3 No Other Warranty**. Except as expressly stated in the Agreement, the Services are provided **AS IS. Filestack disclaims any implied warranties, such as a warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement, and any representation or warranty that may arise through a course of dealing. You acknowledge that the use of the Service may not be uninterrupted, error free, or completely secures.** If applicable law requires Filestack to make a warranty notwithstanding this disclaimer, then the warranty is made for a period of thirty (30) days from the date that it is deemed to have been made, and your sole and exclusive remedy for a breach of the warranty is a refund of fees paid for the Services covered by the warranty. You represent that you have not relied on any representation or warranty other than those stated in the Agreement.

**6.4 Indemnification**. You agree that if a third party asserts a legal claim against Filestack or any of its officers, members, managers, employees, staff, personnel, agents, licensors or suppliers (the “**Filestack Persons**“) arising from your violation of these Services Terms or any Order, including your breach of a representation or warranty, or if your customer or end user asserts a legal claim against any of the Filestack Persons on any basis other than the gross negligence or misconduct of a Filestack person, you will pay all reasonable costs of defending the claim, including reasonable attorney fees, and any damages awarded to the third party or paid to the third party by Filestack as a reasonable settlement. You agree that Filestack may control the defense of the claim at its option, or may require you to defend the claim directly. If Filestack elects to control the defense of the claim, you will reimburse Filestack for its reasonable defense costs and expenses as incurred.

**6.5 Limitation of Liability. In the event you have a legal claim against any of the Filestack Persons, you agree that the maximum total amount of money you can recover from any or all of them cannot exceed the amount of fees you have paid or that are payable for Service for the six (6) months prior to the date the claim arose, unless the legal claim is based on a Filestack Person’s intentional misconduct or is for personal injury or death resulting from the negligence, recklessness or intentional misconduct of a Filestack Person. In addition, you agree that in no event are you entitled to recover any lost revenue, lost profits, damages for lost data, or any indirect or consequential loss or damages or any kind.**

**6.6 General**. You acknowledge that Filestack has set its fees and entered into the Order in reliance on the limitations of remedies and liability stated in these Terms, and that these limitations reflect an agreed allocation of risk between you and Filestack. The limitations stated in this Section shall apply to any liability arising from any cause of action whatsoever, whether in contract, tort, commercial code, strict liability or otherwise, **even if a limited remedy fails of its essential purpose**. If these limitations as written are not permitted by applicable law, they shall apply to the extent permitted by applicable law.

The arbitration will be conducted in person unless each of party agrees to a telephonic or written submissions procedure. The arbitrator shall issue a reasoned award with findings of fact and conclusions of law. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Either party may bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration under this Agreement, or to enforce or vacate an arbitration award. **Each party waives any right to a trial by jury, and agrees that disputes will be resolved through arbitration. No claim subject to this provision may be brought as a class or collective action, nor may you assert such a claim as a member of a class or collective action that is brought by another claimant.** Each party agrees not bring a claim related to the Services or the subject matter of an Order or these Services Terms more than two years after the time that the claim accrued. Except as may be required by law, neither a party nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of both parties.

**8.8 Informal Dispute Resolution**.

**8.9 Injunctive Relief**. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement does not prohibit, condition or delays a party’s right to seek injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to address the other party’s infringement or misappropriation of its intellectual property, or the other party’s breach of its confidentiality obligations under this Agreement.

**8.10 Export Compliance**.
