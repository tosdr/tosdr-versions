### What are cookies?

Cookies are small pieces of information sent to your device by a website or service. These files are stored by your web browser for the duration of the session until your browser is closed, or they can be persistent cookies that expire after a period of time.

    * These are cookies essential to providing or using the service. Without these cookies, the service would not be able to correctly function.
2. **Functional cookies**
