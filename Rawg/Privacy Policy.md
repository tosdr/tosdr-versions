### Automated decision-making

We may use your information for automated decision-making, including profiling (more details here). We may also use your information to create and update user profiles. This allows us to evaluate your choices, preferences and behaviour for the purposes outlined in the section Purposes of processing.

We may engage in this type of data processing only if it is necessary to enter into or perform an agreement with you, or on the basis of your explicit consent.

The rationale behind the automated decision-making is:

* to enable or otherwise improve the decision-making process;
* to grant all our users fair and unbiased treatment based on consistent and uniform criteria;
* to reduce the potential harm derived from human error and personal bias, which may potentially lead to discrimination or imbalance in the treatment of users.

Users, whose information is processed as part of the automated decision-making, have the right:

* to obtain an explanation about any decision taken as a result of automated decision-making and express their point of view regarding this decision;
* to challenge a decision by asking us to reconsider it or take a new decision on a different basis;
* to request and obtain human intervention on such processing;
* to object to profiling activity.

### How we share your information

We may share your information with a third party only to the extend it is necessary to achieve the purposes outlined in the section Purposes of processing.

We may be allowed to retain your information for a longer period when you have given consent to such retention. We may also retain your information if required to do so by law or upon an order of a state authority.

### How you can control your information

You have the following rights in relation to the processing of your information:

* to obtain confirmation as to whether or not we process your information, learn about certain aspects of such processing and obtain a copy of your information that we process;
* to verify the accuracy of your information and ask us to update or correct it;
* to withdraw consent where you have previously given your consent to the processing of your information;
* to object to the processing of your information. Where your information is processed for direct marketing purposes, you can object at any time to its processing for such marketing, which includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing;
* to restrict, under certain circumstances, the processing of your information;
* to obtain, under certain circumstances, the erasure of your information;
* to receive, under certain circumstances, your information in a structured, commonly used and machine readable format and, if technically feasible, to have it transmitted to another controller without any hindrance;
* to lodge a complaint before a competent data protection authority.

You can direct any requests related to the exercise of your rights to us at [\[email protected\]](https://rawg.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). We will process them free of charge and as early as possible, but always within one month.

RAWG may contain links to sites of thirds parties. The information that you provide to such third parties is not subject to this Privacy Policy and its treatment is not in our control. To learn how your information is collected and processed when you interact with third-party sites, please read their privacy policies.

Please note, that RAWG does not support “Do Not Track” requests. To determine whether any of the third-party services we use honor the “Do Not Track” requests, please read their privacy policies.

### Changes to this Privacy Policy

We keep this Privacy Policy under regular review. We strongly encourage you to check this page [http://rawg.io/privacy\_policy](http://rawg.io/privacy_policy) often, referring to the listed date of the last modification.

Effective Date: 25/05/2018

This Privacy Policy was prepared based on provisions of multiple legislations, including Articles 13 and 14 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
