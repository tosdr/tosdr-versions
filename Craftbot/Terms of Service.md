● may demand the proportionate delivery of counter-services, make good or have the defect repaired by a third party at Operator’s expense, or withdraw from the contract in case the Operator has not undertaken or is unable to fulfill its obligations to repair or replace the same, or if the Customer’s interest in the Product becoming repaired or replaced has lapsed. No withdrawal may be initiated with reference to immaterial defects.

2\. Any repair or replacement shall be completed – in view of the characteristics of the Product concerned and its intended function as expected by the Customer – in due time, to the best of the Customer’s interests.

3\. The Customer may decide to change the chosen rights relating to implied warranty to another option. The Customer is required to pay the costs of the change to the Operator unless the change has been caused by the Operator, or it has become justified otherwise.

4\. Promptly after its detection, the Customer shall notify the obligor of any defect. In the case of a contract with a Customer qualifying as a Consumer, the defect communicated within two months of its discovery shall be deemed to have been notified without delay.

The costs of fulfilling the warranty obligation shall be borne by the Operator. If the Customer’s failure to comply with its maintenance obligations has contributed to the malfunctioning of the Product, the Customer shall bear the incurred costs in proportion of its contribution provided that it has had proper knowledge of the maintenance of the Product, or if the Operator has indeed fulfilled its obligations to provide information in this regard.
