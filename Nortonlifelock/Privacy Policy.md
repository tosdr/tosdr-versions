Please read our [cookie and analytics notice](https://www.nortonlifelock.com/privacy/cookies-and-analytics/) for more information about how we use these tools.

**12\. Automated Individual Decision-Making and Profiling**  

Where Gen Digital processes network traffic data for the purpose of network and information security based on our or our customers’ legitimate interest as outlined in the corresponding section of this Statement, automated decisions concerning data elements may occasionally be made. This could involve assigning relative cybersecurity reputation scores to IP addresses and URLs based on objective cyber-threat indicators measured by our and our partners’ cyber-threat detection engines. Such indicators may be, for instance, the determination that malicious or otherwise harmful contents are hosted at a given URL or are coming from a given IP address. Such automatically assigned reputation scores may be leveraged by you, by Gen Digital, by our partners, and by other customers to detect, block, and mitigate the identified cyber threats. They could therefore result in our Services blocking network traffic coming from or going to such URLs and IP addresses. This processing is intended only to protect you, Gen Digital, our partners, and our other customers from cyber threats. If you consider that such automated processing is unduly affecting you in a significant way, please contact us as explained above (“Contact Us”) to raise your concerns or exercise your right to object and to seek our help in finding a satisfactory solution.

**13\. Children’s Privacy**
---------------------------

Our websites are not directed to, nor do we knowingly collect data from, minors (as defined by applicable law) except where explicitly described otherwise in the privacy notices of Services designed specifically for purposes such as to assist you by providing child online protection features. In such cases, we will only collect, and process personal data related to any child under 13 years of age that you choose to disclose to us or otherwise instruct us to collect and process. We also do not sell or share personal information of consumers under 16 years of age. Please refer to the [Product Specific Privacy Statements](https://www.nortonlifelock.com/us/en/privacy/product-privacy-notices/ "https://www.nortonlifelock.com/us/en/privacy/product-privacy-notices/") for additional information.

**14\. Changes to this Statement**
----------------------------------

We reserve the right to revise or modify this Statement. In addition, we may update this Privacy Statement to reflect changes to our personal data processing practices. If we make any material changes in the way we collect, process, use and/or disclose your personal data previously collected from you through our Services, we will attempt to notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this website prior to the change becoming effective. In the case of a material change to our personal data processing practices, any such change will only apply on a going-forward basis. We will not process the personal data currently in our possession in a materially different way without your prior consent. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.

**15\. Links to Other Websites**
--------------------------------

Our websites may contain links to other websites owned or operated by other companies. If you visit any linked websites, please review their privacy statements carefully. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of websites that are owned by those third parties. Our websites may also link to co-branded websites that are maintained by Gen Digital and one or more of our business partners who are collecting your personal data pursuant to their own privacy practices. Please review the applicable privacy statements on any co-branded site you visit, as they may differ from ours.
