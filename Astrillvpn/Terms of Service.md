================

1. Your relationship with Astrill
    1. Your use of Astrill's products, software, services and web sites (referred to collectively as the "Services" in this document and excluding any services provided to you by Astrill under a separate written agreement) is subject to the terms of a legal agreement between you and Astrill. This document explains how the agreement is made up, and sets out some of the terms of that agreement.
    2. Unless otherwise agreed in writing with Astrill, your agreement with Astrill will always include, at a minimum, the terms and conditions set out in this document. These are referred to below as the "Universal Terms".
    3. Your agreement with Astrill will also include the terms of any Legal Notices applicable to the Services, in addition to the Universal Terms. All of these are referred to below as the "Additional Terms". Where Additional Terms apply to a Service, these will be accessible for you to read either within, or through your use of, that Service.
    4. The Universal Terms, together with the Additional Terms, form a legally binding agreement between you and Astrill in relation to your use of the Services. It is important that you take the time to read them carefully. Collectively, this legal agreement is referred to below as the "Terms".

Astrill may, in its sole discretion, implement controls to restrict access to its Services or website in any of the Restricted Jurisdictions. If Astrill determines that you are accessing the Services or Astrill website from any Restricted Jurisdiction, or have given false representations as to your location of incorporation, establishment, citizenship or place of residence, Astrill reserves the right to close any of your accounts immediately and prohibit further access to Astrill Services without any claim for refund.
