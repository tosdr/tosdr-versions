Privacy Policy
==============

_Updated as of June 5, 2024._

Blaze Media LLC ("we," "us," "our") works hard to build and maintain a relationship of trust with you. This Privacy Policy (the "Privacy Policy") governs our collection, use, and disclosure of your Personal Information (as defined below) in connection with your use of our website(s) and mobile/device application(s) on which this Privacy Policy is linked (collectively, "Sites"), such as [www.blazetv.com](https://www.blazetv.com/), [www.conservativereview.com](https://www.conservativereview.com/), [www.theblaze.com](https://www.theblaze.com/), and [www.blazemedia.com](https://www.blazemedia.com/) and any services, transactions, or other engagements you might have with us (collectively, "Services").

This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect about you, how we use or disclose such information, how to exercise any rights you may have with respect to your Personal Information (including any rights to opt-out of certain uses of your information), and the safeguards we have in place to reduce the risk of unauthorized access and use.

Please carefully read this Privacy Policy, which is part of our [Terms of Use](https://www.theblaze.com/terms), before using our Sites and/or Services. If you do not agree with our Terms of Use or this Privacy Policy, you must refrain from using our Sites/Services. By accessing or using our Sites or Services, you agree to our use of your information consistent with our Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to our collection, use, or disclosure of Personal Information related to job applicants, employees, contractors, or their dependents, beneficiaries, or emergency contacts. Please see our [Employee, Applicant, and Contractor Privacy Notice](https://www.theblaze.com/california-employee-applicant-and-contractor-personal-information-collection-notice) for information about our privacy practices related to job applicants, employees, contractors, and their dependents, beneficiaries, and emergency contacts.

**Privacy Policy Changes**

This Privacy Policy is subject to change. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy frequently for any revisions or amendments. Changes to this Privacy Policy will be posted on the Sites and will be effective immediately upon posting. You will be deemed to have been made aware of and have accepted the changes by your continued use of our Sites or Services. If we determine that a change to this Privacy Policy will result in using your Personal Information acquired before the change being used in a materially new way, we will provide you notice before using your Personal Information in the new way.

**Conflict Between this Policy and Laws and Regulations**

When federal, state, or local laws and regulations require a higher level of protection for your Personal Information, they take precedence over this Privacy Policy. The specific requirements of this Privacy Policy apply unless disallowed by applicable laws or regulations.

### Information we collect

**Personal Information**

Within the last twelve months, we have collected information that personally identifies, relates to, describes, or is capable of being associated with you ("Personal Information"), including:

|     |     |     |

Biometric Information | Genetic, physiological, behavioral, and biological characteristics, or activity patterns used to extract a template or other identifier or identifying information, such as, fingerprints, faceprints, and voiceprints, iris or retina scans, keystroke, gait, or other physical patterns, and sleep, health, exercise data. | NO  |

The specific Personal Information we collect about you may vary based on how you use the Sites and/or Services and your relationship with us.

We may also collect information that would be considered Personal Information except for the fact that it has been de-identified such that it can no longer be reasonably associated with an identifiable person (“De-Identified Information”). We may use and disclose De-Identified Information for any purpose without restriction. We will not re-identify De-Identified Information.

**Sensitive Personal Information**

Some states define certain Personal Information as “sensitive”. For example, “Sensitive Personal Information” may include Personal Information that reveals government identifiers, complete account credentials with security codes or other ways to access the account, precise geolocation, racial or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical beliefs, union membership, biometric information, genetic data, communication contents if we are not the intended recipient, identifying biometric information, and information about a person’s health, sex life, or sexual orientation. We do not collect Sensitive Personal Information as defined by these states’ laws.

**Children's Personal Information**

The Sites and Services are not intended for children under the age of 18 and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 18. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received Personal Information from a child under the age of 18, we will delete such information from our records.

**Usage Data and Sites Activity**

We automatically collect information in connection with the actions you take on the Sites ("Usage Data"). For example, each time you visit our website, we automatically collect the type of web browser you use, the type of device you use, your operating system, your Internet Service Provider, the pages you view, referring and exit pages, the date and time of your visit, the number of clicks to, from, and within the Sites, and the duration of your visits to the Sites. When you use our mobile application, we gather information such as data and time of your use, duration of use, your device type, and operating system. If this information is reasonably capable of being associated with you, we treat it as Personal Information under the category Internet and Network Information. If this information is not reasonably capable of being individually associated with you, we treat it as Usage Data which is a type of De-Identified Information.

**Communication Recordings**

We and our Service Providers (defined below) may record calls and retain the content of text messages or other written/electronic communications between you and us. By communicating with us, you consent to our and our Service Providers (defined below) recording and retention of communications.

### How we collect personal information

**Voluntary Disclosure Directly From You**

We may ask you to provide us with Personal Information when you communicate with us (online or offline), register to use the Sites, purchase Services, and at other times. You are not required to provide us your Personal Information; however, if you choose not to provide the requested information, you may not be able to use some or all of the features of the Sites or Services or we may not be able to fulfill your requested interaction.

**Third-Party Data Sources**

We may collect Personal Information from third-party data sources such as data brokers, marketing/advertising agencies, payment processors, and government agencies.

**Cookies and Other Automated Tools**

We use cookies (a small text file placed on your computer to identify your computer and browser) and other automated tools such as tracking pixels (collectively referred to herein as “cookies”) to authenticate users and improve the experience of the Sites and Services such as by saving your preferences from visit to visit to present you with a customized version of the Sites. Many web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Instructions for how to manage cookies in popular browsers are generally available online. However, certain features of the Sites and Services may not work properly if you delete or disable cookies.

We use the following types of cookies:

* _Advertising Cookies_: Advertising cookies are used to learn more about you and advertise products/services that might interest you. We may also use information from advertising cookies to improve our marketing strategies.

* _Analytics Cookies_: Analytics cookies help us understand how our Sites are working and who is visiting our Sites. We may use information derived from analytics cookies to improve Site functionality. Google Analytics is one tool we use, and you can learn more by reviewing Google's [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US).

* _Functional Cookies:_ Functional cookies allow our Sites to work as intended such as by ensuring fonts display correctly, allowing you to engage with features like polls, quizzes, and forms, or embedding content from third-party platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, or YouTube. These cookies may also be used to personalize features and remember settings.

Cookies remain on a user's system for varying periods of time. Some only remain during a viewing session, others may remain for a year or longer.

We employ software [technology](https://www.theblaze.com/return/) that enables us to track certain aspects of a user's visit to the Sites and engagement with emails. This technology helps us better manage content on the Sites by informing us what content is effective, how consumers engage with the Sites and emails, and how consumers arrive at and/or depart from the Sites. The software typically uses two methods to track user activity: (1) "tracking pixels" and (2) "clear gifs." Tracking pixels are pieces of executable code that are embedded in a web page that track usage activity including which pages are viewed, when they are viewed, and how long the pages are viewed. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with unique identifiers which are embedded in web pages and email messages that track whether a user has viewed a web page or email message. User activity information may be associated with additional information about a user's session and Personal Information, if provided by the user.

If you arrive at the Sites by "clicking through" from another website, then certain information about you that you provided to that other website, such as the terms you were searching that led you to the Sites, may be transmitted to us and we may use it. You should review the privacy policy of any website from which you reached the Sites to determine what information was collected by that website and for what purposes you agreed that website could use that information. We may retain information about you provided to us by other websites and will only use it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Such information may be associated with other Usage Data or Personal Information.

**Interest-Based Advertising**

We work with third-party advertisers, search providers, and ad networks ("Advertisers") to learn more about you and show you our ads or other of our content that we believe would be relevant to you. Advertisers may collect and use information about your use of the Sites or Services as well as other websites and services. These companies may use cookies and other online tracking technologies to collect and use your information. We and/or Advertisers may also append other data to the data collected by Advertisers to create an interest profile of individual users. Our Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that an Advertiser may collect from you. Advertisements may be shown via the Sites, on third-party websites, or on social media properties. If you do not want to receive some interest-based advertising, please visit the [Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") Consumer Choice Page](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/). The DAA website allows you to opt-out of one or more interest-based advertising networks. Opt-outs are device and browser specific; therefore, you will need to set your opt-out preferences for each device and browser. Deleting browser cookies can remove your opt-out preferences; however, the DAA offers [browser extensions](http://www.aboutads.info/PMC) that help preserve the opt-out preferences you set on the DAA's Consumer Choice Page. Please note that opt-outs only apply to interest-based advertising and not all advertising networks participate. You may still receive other types of online advertising.

**Information from Advertisements**

If you arrive at the Sites via an advertisement (_e.g._, banner ad), we may collect information regarding the advertisement with which you interacted and your interactions (_e.g._, item clicked, date, and time).

### CONSUMER PRIVACY RIGHTS

Laws in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, Texas, Utah, and Virginia provide consumer-residents with specific rights regarding their Personal Information. We provide the rights as described below to consumers residing in those states.

**Right to Know**

You have the right to request twice per 12-month period that we disclose to you certain information about our collection, use, disclosure, and sale of your Personal Information over the past 12 months, including: (i) the categories or specific pieces of Personal Information we collected about you; (ii) the categories of sources from which your Personal Information was collected; (iii) the business or commercial purpose(s) for which we collected your Personal Information; (iv) the categories of third parties with whom we shared your Personal Information; (v) the categories of third parties to whom we sold your Personal Information; and (vi) our business or commercial purposes for selling Personal Information.

We are not permitted to provide access to specific pieces of Personal Information if the Personal Information is sensitive or creates a high risk of potential harm from disclosure to an unauthorized person such as financial information, social security numbers, and driver's license numbers. We will not provide specific pieces of Personal Information unless you expressly request them.

**Right to Deletion**

You have the right to request that we delete any Personal Information we have collected about you. Please understand that we are not required to honor a deletion request if a legal exemption applies such as if we need the information to complete a requested or reasonably anticipated transaction, prevent security incidents or fraud, or comply with legal obligations.

**Right to Correct**

You have the right to request that we correct inaccurate Personal Information we maintain about you. After you request to correct inaccurate Personal Information, we will provide instructions for you to provide us with optional documentation to support your request and we will consider it.

We may decline to correct your Personal Information if we determine based on the totality of the circumstances that your Personal Information is more likely than not accurate. We may also decline to correct your Personal Information if we determine that your request is fraudulent or abusive. If your request to correct your Personal Information is denied, you may request that we note in our records and notify any Service Providers and third parties to whom we disclosed your allegedly inaccurate Personal Information that its accuracy has been disputed.

We may decide to delete your allegedly inaccurate Personal Information instead of correcting it.

**Right to Opt-Out of the Sale or Sharing of Personal Information**

You have the right to request that we do not sell or share your Personal Information to others. You may do so by using our [Do Not Sell/Share My Personal Information online form](https://www.theblaze.com/dns/) or by following the instructions for submitting a request below. Please note that opting out of the sale or sharing of Personal Information will not affect any sale or sharing of your Personal Information that may have occurred prior to the date of your opt-out request.

We will recognize browser-based opt-out signals required by law including, without limitation, Global Privacy Control. If we receive an opt-out signal and are able to identify the consumer to whom the signal relates, we will treat the signal as a request to opt out of the sale or sharing of all Personal Information we have on file for the consumer and disable related third-party cookies. If we receive an opt-out signal and are not able to identify the consumer to whom the signal relates, we will treat the signal as a request to opt out limited to the Personal Information we collect from the consumer during the online session during which the signal is present and to disable related third-party cookies.

**Right to Appeal**
