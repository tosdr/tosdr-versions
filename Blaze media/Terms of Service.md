These Terms of Use together with our [Privacy Policy](https://www.theblaze.com/privacy), [online store Refund Policy](https://shop.blazemedia.com/policies/refund-policy), and any Additional Terms (as defined below) (collectively, the "Terms") constitute your complete agreement regarding your use of the Site and Services. By using the Site or Services, you agree to the Terms.  

READ THESE TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY. THEY REQUIRE BINDING ARBITRATION FOR THE RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES AND WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AGAINST US.

### 1\. ELIGIBILITY

You must be at least 18 years old to use the Site or the Services. The Site and Services are intended for use only by individuals located in the United States of America. To use our application your device may need to meet certain minimum specifications. Please see our application's product page in the applicable application store for more information on device requirements.

### 2\. ADDITIONAL TERMS

Your use of certain Services or participation in sweepstakes, contests, or promotions (collectively, "Promotions") may be subject to additional terms and conditions or rules ("Additional Terms"). Where Additional Terms apply, we will make them available for you to read before you use that Service or participate in the Promotion. By using such Services or participating in such Promotion, you agree to the Additional Terms.

### 3\. PASSWORD AND ACCOUNT SECURITY

You may create your own account on the Site by completing the online registration process on the Site. In doing so, you must provide us with accurate and complete registration information, and update it if this information changes. You agree that you will not register under the name of another person, choose a username that is vulgar, profane or otherwise offensive, choose a username that impersonates or suggests representation of another person or entity, or choose a username that includes a solicitation.

If you create an account, we will assign you, or allow you to select, a password. You must keep your password confidential, and you may not permit any other person to use your password or your account to view [BlazeTV](https://subscribe.blazetv.com/), Blaze News, or for any other purpose. You will be responsible for all use of your password, including, without limitation, any use by any authorized or unauthorized third party. You must notify us immediately if you believe your password may be used by any unauthorized person or entity. For security purposes, we recommend you change your password often. Under no circumstance should you respond to a request for your password. Our employees will never ask for your password. You must notify us immediately if you receive such a request. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your use of the Site if we believe that your password is being used without permission or otherwise in a manner that may disrupt the Site.

### 4\. SUBSCRIPTION AND RENEWAL TERMS; REFUND AND CANCELLATION POLICIES

We offer two subscription products for consumers to choose from:

* **Blaze News** allows users to access premium written content without advertisements at TheBlaze.com during the applicable subscription period.
* **BlazeTV+** allows users to access Blaze News (as described above) in addition to viewing BlazeTV episodes and content we broadcast via the Site and the Services during the applicable subscription period (excepting limited content that is available only as an add-on bundle as described below). We make no guarantee as to the availability of any particular episode or content of BlazeTV or the total number of episodes or amount of content to be broadcast.

When you purchase a subscription through the Site or the Services, you agree to pay the applicable subscription fee, as well as any applicable taxes and renewal charges as described below. If we are unable to charge your credit card or other payment method, your subscription will automatically terminate.

We may increase our subscription prices at any time; however, we will give you at least thirty (30) days' advance notice of any price increase, and the price increase will not apply until your current subscription period has concluded. This will give you an opportunity to cancel your subscription, as described below, before the price increase takes effect. You are responsible for your own cellular data fees and internet service provider fees.

_Free Trial Period_

Your subscription may begin with a free trial; provided, however that you may only sign up for a free trial one time every 365 days. We will begin charging for your selected subscription at the end of the free trial period and the date of such charge will be considered your purchase date for purposes of subscription period calculations. You may not receive a notice from us that your free trial period has ended. TO AVOID BEING CHARGED, YOU MUST CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION BEFORE THE END OF THE FREE TRIAL PERIOD. You can cancel your subscription by calling (800) 282-2788 (Monday through Friday from 9:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. CT, holidays excepted), or emailing [support@blazemedia.com](mailto:support@blazemedia.com). Additionally, depending upon your jurisdiction, you may cancel your BlazeTV+ subscription by clicking on the profile icon in the main menu, clicking on "Purchases" then selecting "Cancel" or [clicking here](https://www.blazetv.com/purchases) (make sure you are logged in). To cancel your Blaze News subscription, go to your account page, click on “Subscriptions” then select “Cancel” or click here (make sure you are logged in).

_Promotional Code_

If you use a promotional code or "promo code" to obtain a BlazeTV subscription at a discounted price, the discount applies only during the initial subscription period and does not apply to renewal periods. All renewals will be charged at the then-current subscription price.

_Professional Discount_

Students, first responders, active military members, and veterans may obtain a discount on the first year of their annual BlazeTV subscription as advertised from time to time by us. In order to qualify, you must verify your identity and eligibility through our service provider ID.me. Our eligibility decisions are final. We may discontinue or modify this discount program at any time.

_Payment Processor_

If you subscribe through our website, payment processing will be provided by Stripe, Inc. ("Stripe") or PayPal, Inc. ("PayPal") depending on your choice of payment processor and the subscription plan you select. Stripe's Terms of Use and Privacy Policy are available at [www.stripe.com](https://www.stripe.com/). PayPal's Terms of Use and Privacy Policy are available at [www.paypal.com](https://www.paypal.com/).

If you subscribe through our application, your payment will be processed by the respective application store provider such as the Apple App Store, Google Play Store, or Roku Channel Store. Your interactions with such third-party application stores and the manufacturer of the device you are using will be governed by their respective terms of use and privacy policies. They may have payment and refund policies that differ from ours. We are not responsible for any actions, content of websites, terms of use, privacy policies, or other policies of such third parties. You should check the applicable terms of use and privacy policies of those third parties before purchase.

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER BLAZE MEDIA LLC NOR ITS AFFILIATES WILL BE LIABLE UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF REVENUES, PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF SUCH PARTIES WERE ADVISED OF, KNEW OF OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO USE OF THE SITE OR SERVICES.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages. Accordingly, some of the above limitations and disclaimers may not apply to you. To the extent Blaze Media LLC may not, as a matter of applicable law, disclaim any implied warranty or limit its liabilities, the scope and duration of such warranty and the extent of Blaze Media LLC's liability will be the minimum permitted under such law.

### 15\. INDEMNIFICATION

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Blaze Media LLC and its Affiliates from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, expenses, fees of any kind (including reasonable attorneys' fees and legal costs), arising from or relating to: (a) any information (including feedback or any other content) that you or anyone using your account submit, post, or transmit through the Site or Services; (b) the use of the Site or Services by you or anyone using your account; (c) the violation of these Terms by you or anyone using your account; or (d) the violation of any rights of any third party, including intellectual property, privacy, publicity, or other proprietary rights by you or anyone using your account. We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you. If we do assume the defense of such a matter, you will reasonably cooperate with us in such defense.

### 16\. DISPUTE RESOLUTION

Any controversy, claim, or dispute arising out of or related to these Terms (or the interpretation, performance, or breach of them), the Site, or the Services, including but not limited to alleged violations of state or federal statutory or common law rights or duties (a "Dispute") shall be solely and exclusively resolved according to the procedures set forth in this paragraph. If we are unable to resolve any Dispute through informal means, either party may initiate binding arbitration of such Dispute. The arbitration shall be initiated and conducted according to the JAMS/Endispute Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures in effect as of the date hereof, including the Optional Appeal Procedure provided for in such rules (the "Arbitration Rules"). The arbitration shall be conducted in New York, New York, before a single neutral arbitrator appointed in accordance with the Arbitration Rules. The arbitrator's decision shall be controlled by these Terms, including any applicable Additional Terms. No Disputes may be arbitrated on a class or representative basis; arbitration can decide only the individual Dispute and the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated. BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND ANY RIGHT YOU MAY HAVE TO JOIN CLAIMS WITH THOSE OF OTHERS IN THE FORM OF A CLASS ACTION OR SIMILAR PROCEDURAL DEVICE. ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO, OR CONNECTED WITH THESE TERMS MUST BE ASSERTED INDIVIDUALLY. The arbitrator shall not have the power to award punitive damages against any party. Without limiting the foregoing, any lawsuit filed relating to these Terms, the Site, Services, or your relationship with us, must be filed in the state or federal courts sitting in New York, New York and you agree to irrevocably submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of such courts.

### 17\. OTHER PROVISIONS

We will be excused from failures or delays in delivery or performance of the Site and/or Services, if such failure or delay is attributable to causes beyond our reasonable control such as weather, acts of God, natural disaster, war, terrorist attack, disease, epidemic/pandemic, criminal activity, riot, civil unrest, strike, or utility failure.

These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any conflict of laws rules or provisions.

If any provision of these Terms is found to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity or enforceability of any remaining provisions. It is the parties' intention that the court or arbitrator modify such invalid provision to give it the fullest effect permissible under applicable law.

Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not act as a waiver of such right or provision and will not prevent us from enforcing such right or provision or any other right or provision in the future.

These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted to you hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you without our written permission. We may assign or transfer our rights, licenses, and obligations under these Terms without restriction, including without limitation in connection with a merger, acquisition, a sale of assets or by operation of law.

### 18\. CHANGES TO THESE TERMS

We may, in our sole discretion, modify the Terms from time to time. If a change is material, as determined by us in our sole discretion, we will provide at least fourteen (14) days' notice prior the effective date of the change via a post on the Site and/or email to you. By not terminating your relationship with us prior to the effective date of the change, you acknowledge and agree that you shall be bound by the updated Terms. We suggest periodically visiting this page of the Site to review these Terms.
