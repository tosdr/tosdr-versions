### TRADEMARKS

Cuddlist and other marks indicated on this Web Site from time to time are trademarks of Cuddlist in the U.S. or other jurisdictions. The absence of a mark from being listed here should not be viewed as a waiver by Cuddlist of any of its rights concerning that mark. Other Cuddlist product or service names, logos, graphics, page headers, button icons and scripts are trademarks or trade dress of Cuddlist and may not be used in connection with any product or service that is not Cuddlist’s in any manner, but especially that which is likely to cause confusion in the marketplace or in any matter that disparages or discredits Cuddlist. All other trademarks not owned by Cuddlist that appear on this site are the property of their respective owners who may or may not be affiliated with or connected to Cuddlist. You are not permitted to use any mark displayed on this site for any purpose without the prior written consent of the owner.

If you believe that your trademark (the “Mark”) appears on the Cuddlist website in a way that constitutes trademark infringement, please provide Cuddlist’s Designated Copyright Agent (specified above) with the following information:

* Your physical or electronic signature, or a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on your behalf;
* Information reasonably sufficient to permit Cuddlist to contact you or your authorized agent, including a name, address, telephone number and, if available, an email address;
* Identification of the Mark(s) alleged to have been infringed, including (i) for registered Marks, a copy of each relevant federal trademark registration certificate or (ii) for common law or other Marks, evidence sufficient to establish your claimed rights in the Mark, including the nature of your use of the Mark, and the time period and geographic area in which the Mark has been used by you;
* Information reasonably sufficient to permit Cuddlist to identify the use being challenged;
* A statement that you have not authorized the challenged use, and that you have a good-faith belief that the challenged use is not authorized by law; and
* A statement under penalty of perjury that all of the information in the notification is accurate and that you are the Mark owner, or are authorized to act on behalf of the Mark owner.

Upon receipt of notice as described above, Cuddlist will seek to confirm the existence of the Mark on the Cuddlist website, notify the user who posted the content including the Mark, and take whatever action, in its sole discretion, it deems appropriate, including temporary or permanent removal of the Mark from the Site.

A registered user may respond to notice of takedown by showing either (a) that the Mark has been cancelled, or has expired or lapsed or (b) that the registered user has a trademark registration, an unexpired license covering the use, or some other relevant right to the Mark, or (c) that the use is for other reasons shown by the registered user non-infringing. If the registered user makes an appropriate showing of either (a), (b) or (c) then Cuddlist may exercise its discretion not to remove the Mark. If Cuddlist decides to comply with a takedown request, it will do so within a reasonably expeditious period of time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Cuddlist will comply as appropriate with the terms of any court order relating to alleged trademark infringement on the Site.

### USER’S AGREEMENT TO HOLD CUDDLIST HARMLESS FROM CLAIMS

Cuddlist has no obligation to adjudicate intellectual property claims.

Claimants and users must understand that Cuddlist is not an intellectual property tribunal. While we may in our discretion use the information provided in order to decide how to respond to infringement claims, we are not responsible for determining the merits of such claims. If a user responds to a claim of infringement by providing assurances that its content is not infringing, the user agrees that if we thereafter restore or maintain the content, the user will defend and hold Cuddlist harmless from any resulting claims of infringement brought against Cuddlist.
