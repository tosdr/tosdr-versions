If Customer has provided SecurityMetrics with credit card information ("Card Information"), Customer authorizes SecurityMetrics to charge Customer the price of the Services, as provided in the invoice or order confirmation sent by SecurityMetrics, using the Card Information. Customer also authorizes SecurityMetrics to charge any cancellation fee associated with the cancellation of the Services. If Customer is purchasing online Compliance services, Customer also authorizes SecurityMetrics to automatically charge the price of Services for each renewal term of this Agreement using the Card Information. Customer agrees to give SecurityMetrics prompt notice of any changes to the Card Information.

Cancellation Fee.

For Customers that have purchased packages of services that contain Managed Firewall Services, a cancellation fee will apply if Customer cancels the Managed Firewall Services before the end of the three-year term. The cancellation fee will cover the costs of hardware and the setup fees and may vary depending on the circumstances of the cancellation.

Collection Costs.

If SecurityMetrics uses a collection agency or attorney to collect money owed by you, you agree to pay the reasonable costs of collection, including, but not limited to, any collection agency's fees, reasonable attorneys' fees, and arbitration or court costs.

Refund Policy.

If an acquirer or merchant service provider pays for the Services, refunds may not apply. Refunds for the unused portion of services may be obtained by contacting the Account Renewals team at SecurityMetrics. Refunds will be processed within 5 business days.

### Accuracy of Information

Customer's compliance depends entirely upon the accuracy of information provided to SecurityMetrics by Customer. Customer agrees that if Customer provides incomplete or inaccurate information this may affect the Services, Customer's compliance status, and SecurityMetrics will not be held liable for any damages incurred as a result of incomplete or inaccurate information provided by customer. A scan result from SecurityMetrics only indicates the compliance status of the systems that SecurityMetrics has scanned and does not represent Customer's overall compliance status with the PCI Data Security Standards. Customer also agrees to give SecurityMetrics prompt notice if any information affecting data security previously provided to SecurityMetrics has changed, is changing or will change. Customer understands and agrees that any threat designated as a false positive by Customer is done at Customer's own risk. In no event shall SecurityMetrics be liable for any damages incurred by Customer as a result of Customer's designation of a threat as a false positive.

### Communications

Customer authorizes SecurityMetrics to contact Customer through email, phone or fax to notify Customer of changes in Customer's compliance status or Services. Customer also authorizes SecurityMetrics to contact Customer in regards to payment, renewal, cancellation, or the Services.

### PREMIUM SERVICE WARRANTY("BREACH PROTECTION").

The following Premium Service Warranty ("PSW") applies to Customers who have purchased Services that also contains a premium service warranty.

1. #### The Warranty.
    
    1. SecurityMetrics will provide a PSW to merchants or entities in the health industry (collectively "Merchants") that have purchased service packages that include a premium service warranty. This PSW provision modifies the Limited Warranty provision set forth above for those Merchants that are enrolled in and have purchased a service package that includes a PSW. SecurityMetrics represents and warrants that SecurityMetrics PCI DSS and HIPAA compliance Services will be performed in accordance and comply with the PCI DSS as amended or HIPAA as amended from time to time. SecurityMetrics provides a PSW to a Merchant only for Services actually purchased by the Merchants.
    2. Exclusions. This PSW excludes incorrect data, information, or policies provided by the Merchant, zero-day vulnerabilities, customer labeled false positives identified by SecurityMetrics' scanning engine. The PSW does not apply to SecurityMetrics Managed Firewall Services, any security and privacy trainings sold by SecurityMetrics, and any services performed by a Qualified Security Assessor, Payment Application Qualified Security Assessor, Point-to-Point Encryption Qualified Security Assessor, Payment Card Industry Forensic Investigator, penetration tester, or an employee supervised by one of the above-mentioned specialists.
    3. A Merchant that is enrolled in SecurityMetrics' PCI or HIPAA compliance services that includes a PSW, and suffers a data breach as a result of a failure of such SecurityMetrics' Services, will be reimbursed by SecurityMetrics for certain expenses described in Section 2 below and subject to all other terms and conditions in this Terms of Use Agreement. The foregoing sets forth SecurityMetrics' sole liability and a Merchant's sole remedy for any data breach while enrolled with a PSW Service.
    4. A Merchant's credit card processor, acquiring bank, independent sales organization, or merchant services provider (collectively "Acquirer") may contract and/or pay SecurityMetrics for the PCI compliance Services, for which SecurityMetrics provides the PSW.
2. #### Reimbursement Limitations.
    
    The PSW is not available to level 1 Merchants, as level 1 Merchants are defined by the card brands. The PSW is only available to Merchants located in the United States and Canada and that have enrolled in and paid (or whose Acquirer has paid) SecurityMetrics for the Services described in this Terms of Use Agreement or an applicable Statement of Work. The PSW reimburses a Merchant up to $100,000 (the "PSW Limit") per Merchant identification number (or other mutually agreed upon form of identification,) subject to the terms and limitations described more fully below. SecurityMetrics will reimburse Merchants only for the following costs and expenses actually incurred as a result of a failure of SecurityMetrics' Services to comply with PCI DSS and HIPAA, and that are timely reported according to Section 5 below by Merchants in connection with a properly reported data breach:
    
    1. Penalties or fines charged to Merchant by Visa, MasterCard, Discover, American Express, or JCB directly or through an Acquirer. A fine or penalty by a card brand must not exceed the maximum monetary assessment, fine, fee, or penalty permitted by applicable rules or agreements in effect as of the inception date of this Terms of Use Agreement.
    2. Costs of a forensic investigation conducted by a PCI Forensic Investigator approved by the PCI Security Standards Council.
    3. The costs associated with replacing credit cards that were compromised in a breach.
    4. Any GLBA or HIPAA regulatory penalty or fine charged to a Merchant by a governmental regulatory agency or body.
    5. The cost of an audit to determine the cause or extent of a GLBA or HIPAA violation.
    6. If approved in writing by SecurityMetrics, notification costs, victim cost reimbursement, or identity theft monitoring and services.
3. #### The Program is Not Insurance.
    
    The PSW is not insurance. Neither Merchants nor any other entity with which the Merchant has a relationship receives insurance as a result of the PSW or this Terms of Use Agreement. Neither the Merchant nor any other entity with which the Merchant has a relationship is an "insured" or beneficiary under any insurance policy. Nothing in PSW or this Terms of Use Agreement creates an insurance relationship between Acquirer or the merchant and AIG (or any other AIG affiliate). SecurityMetrics is not providing Merchants or any entity with which Merchants have a relationship with insurance pursuant to a contractual agreement.
    
4. #### The Program Limit.
    
    The PSW Limit is the most any Merchant can recover for each merchant identification number (or other mutually agreed upon form of identification) during a twelve (12) month period for any or all such costs or expenses, combined, and regardless of the number of data security events discovered or regulatory actions taken.
    
5. #### Notification.
    
    Merchants are required to provide SecurityMetrics notice within thirty (30) days of discovery or suspicious of a breach or compromise. A Merchant is required to provide SecurityMetrics with any documentation, invoice, or other evidence required by SecurityMetrics within thirty (30) days after receipt of this documentation, invoice, or other evidence.
    
6. #### Reporting.
    
    The PSW reimburses Merchants only if a Merchant provides a timely (within 30 days) notification and complete report of a data security event or regulatory action as soon as the Merchant becomes aware of such event or action. Merchants will need to provide details on the data security event or regulatory action including, but not limited to: a complete description of the data security event or regulatory action, all documents relating to the data security event or regulatory action, and any other pertinent information requested by or on behalf of SecurityMetrics. To report a data security event or regulatory action under the Program, contact SecurityMetrics at: Breach\_Reporting@securitymetrics.com.
    
7. #### Reimbursement Process.
    
    1. Merchants must provide invoices of costs described in Section 1 above to SecurityMetrics in a timely manner–within 30 days. Merchants may email SecurityMetrics at the email address above, or by certified mail to 1275 West 1600 North, Orem, Utah 84057.
    2. Once an invoice is received by SecurityMetrics, SecurityMetrics will determine whether the PSW applies to the Merchant's breach or compromise. If SecurityMetrics determines that the PSW applies and SecurityMetrics will reimburse the Merchant in accordance with the PSW terms, then SecurityMetrics will provide the Merchant with the reimbursement in a reasonable time. If SecurityMetrics determines that the PSW doesn't apply, then SecurityMetrics will notify the Merchant that no reimbursement is available.
8. #### Limitation of Liability for the Program.
    
    Merchants assume sole responsibility and liability for making timely and complete claims under the PSW, providing necessary or requested data and information, and otherwise complying with the terms and conditions set forth in the PSW.
