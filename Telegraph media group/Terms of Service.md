If you are a copyright owner and believe infringing use of your content is on our Service, or you are a User that has received notice that you have posted allegedly copyright infringing content on our Service, click [here](#terms5a).

**A.**  DMCA Notice.  Telegraph asks our users to respect the intellectual property rights of others.  It is our policy to respond appropriately to clear notices of alleged copyright infringement, as set forth more fully below.  In Telegraph’s sole discretion, Telegraph may remove content that may be infringing on another person’s intellectual property rights with or without notice to the potential infringer.  In accordance with the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) and other applicable law, Telegraph has adopted a policy of terminating, in appropriate circumstances, users who are deemed to be repeat infringers.  

**B.**  If we remove or disable access in response to a DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice, we will make a good faith attempt to contact the owner or administrator of the affected content so that they may make a counter-notification.  If you own a copyright in a work (or represent such a copyright owner) and believe that your (or such owner’s) copyright in that work has been infringed by an improper posting or distribution of it via the Service, then you may send us a written notice that includes all of the following: 

* (i) a legend or subject line that says: “DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice”; 
* (ii) a description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed or, if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works;

* (iv) your full name, address, telephone number, and email address; 
* (v) a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; 
* (vi) a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that all the information in your notice is accurate, and that you are the copyright owner (or, if you are not the copyright owner, then your statement must indicate that you are authorized to act on the behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed); and 
* (vii) your electronic or physical signature. 

Telegraph will only respond to DMCA Notices that it receives by email or mail at the addresses below:

For more information contact us by email.

It is often difficult to determine if your copyright has been infringed.  Telegraph may elect to not respond to DMCA Notices that do not substantially comply with all of the foregoing requirements, and Telegraph may elect to remove allegedly infringing material that comes to its attention via notices that do not substantially comply with the DMCA.  

Please note that the DMCA provides that any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing may be subject to liability.

We may send the information that you provide in your notice to the person who provided the allegedly infringing work.  That person may elect to send us a DMCA Counter-Notification.

Without limiting Telegraph’s other rights, Telegraph may, in appropriate circumstances, terminate a repeat infringer’s access to the Service and any other website owned or operated by Telegraph.  

**C.**  Counter-Notification.  If access on the Service to a work that you submitted to Telegraph is disabled or the work is removed as a result of a DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice, and if you believe that the disabled access or removal is the result of mistake or misidentification, then you may send us a DMCA Counter-Notification to the addresses above.  Your DMCA Counter-Notification should contain the following information:

* (i) a legend or subject line that says:  “DMCA Counter-Notification”;
* (ii) a description of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled (please include the full URL of the page(s) on the Service from which the material was removed or access to it disabled);
* (iii) a statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled;
* (iv) your full name, address, telephone number, email address, and the username of your Account;
* (v) a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located (or, if the address is located outside the U.S.A., to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Central District of California), and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided DMCA notification to us or an agent of such person; and
* (vi) your electronic or physical signature.

Please note that the DMCA provides that any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification may be subject to liability.

If we receive a DMCA Counter-Notification, then we may replace the material that we removed (or stop disabling access to it) in not less than ten (10) and not more than fourteen (14) business days following receipt of the DMCA Counter-Notification.  However, we will not do this if we first receive notice at the addresses above that the party who sent us the DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice has filed a lawsuit asking a court for an order restraining the person who provided the material from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on the Service.  You should also be aware that we may forward the Counter-Notification to the party who sent us the DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice.

If the Dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after notification, the claimant may proceed to initiate proceedings as set forth in this Section 8.

**C.   Arbitration of Claims.**  Unless you give us notice of opt-out within five (5) business days of your first use of the Service, addressed to: Telegraph Media Group Holdings Limited, 111 Buckingham Palace Road, London, SW1W 0DT, United Kingdom (Attn: General Counsel), all actions or proceedings arising in connection with, touching upon or relating to any Dispute, or the scope of the provisions of this Section, shall be submitted to JAMS ([www.jamsadr.com](http://www.jamsadr.com/)) for final and binding arbitration under its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures if the matter in dispute is over $250,000 or under its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures if the matter in dispute is $250,000 or less, to be held in  New York, New York, before a single arbitrator in accordance with the New York Civil Practice Law & Rules §§ 7501 et seq.

The fact that there is a dispute between the parties that is the subject of arbitration shall be confidential to the same extent. The parties may engage in the discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the dispute. The arbitrator shall issue a written opinion stating the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator’s award is based.  Neither party shall be entitled or permitted to commence or maintain any action in a court of law with respect to any matter in dispute until such matter shall have been submitted to arbitration as herein provided and then only for the enforcement of the arbitrator’s award; provided, however, that prior to the appointment of the arbitrator or for remedies beyond the jurisdiction of an arbitrator, at any time, either party may seek pendente lite relief (subject to the provisions of these Terms waiving or limiting that relief) in a court of competent jurisdiction in New York, New York or, if sought by Telegraph, such other court that may have jurisdiction over you, without thereby waiving its right to arbitration of the dispute or controversy under this Section; provided further, however, that the losing party shall have fifteen (15) business days after the issuance of the arbitrator’s decision to fully comply with such decision, after which the prevailing party may enforce such decision by a petition to the New York County Supreme Court or, in the case of you, such other court having jurisdiction over you, which may be made ex parte, for confirmation and enforcement of the award. 

**D.  Additional Procedures for Multiple Case Filings.** 

(i) Multiple Case Filings. You and we agree that these “Additional Procedures for Multiple Case Filings” in this Section 14 shall also apply if you or we are subject to twenty-five (25) or more individual arbitration demands of a substantially similar nature with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations (“Multiple Case Filing”). For the avoidance of doubt, this includes where you choose to participate in a Multiple Case Filing against us; for example, where your counsel asserts your Dispute against us in a Multiple Case Filing. Please be aware that if you do so, the resolution of your Dispute might be delayed and ultimately proceed in court. You and we agree that as part of these procedures, the parties’ counsel shall meet and confer in good faith in an effort to resolve the Disputes, streamline procedures, address the exchange of information, modify the number of Disputes to be adjudicated, and conserve the parties’ and the arbitrator’s resources. The limitations period(s) applicable to each arbitration demand within a Multiple Case Filing, including any applicable statutes of limitations and the requirement to file within one (1) year, shall remain tolled from the time a party makes a pre-arbitration demand to the time when that party files the arbitration demand with the arbitration provider.

(ii) STAGE ONE: If at least twenty-five (25) disputes are submitted as part of the Multiple Case Filing, you and we shall select sixteen (16) Disputes (eight (8) per side) to proceed as cases in individual arbitrations (“Bellwether Arbitrations”) as part of this initial staged process. The number of Disputes to be selected to proceed in Stage One can be increased by agreement of counsel for the parties (and if there are fewer than 50 disputes, all shall proceed individually in Stage One). While the Bellwether Arbitrations are adjudicated, no other demand for arbitration that is part of the Multiple Case Filing may be processed, administrated, or adjudicated, and no filing or other administrative costs for such a demand for arbitration shall be due from either party to the arbitration provider. If, contrary to this provision, a party prematurely files non-Bellwether Arbitrations with the arbitration provider, the parties agree that the arbitration provider shall hold those demands in abeyance. Following resolution of the Bellwether Arbitrations, the parties shall participate in a global mediation of all the remaining demands from the Multiple Case Filings, with a mediator jointly selected by counsel of the parties in an effort to resolve the remaining Disputes that are a part of the Multiple Case Filing.

(iii) STAGE TWO: If the remaining Disputes from the Multiple Case Filings have not been resolved at the conclusion of Stage One, you and we shall select fifty (50) Disputes (twenty-five (25) per side) to proceed as cases in individual arbitrations as Bellwether Arbitrations as part of Stage Two. The number of Disputes to be selected to proceed as part of Stage Two can be increased by agreement of counsel for the parties (and if there are fewer than 50 Disputes, all shall proceed individually in Stage Two). The remaining Disputes shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed or collected in connection with those claims. After this second set of staged proceedings, the parties shall engage in a global mediation session of all remaining Disputes from the Multiple Case Filing with a retired mediator jointly selected by counsel in an effort to resolve the remaining Disputes (as informed by the adjudications of cases in Stages One and Two). Upon the completion of the mediation set forth in Stage Two, each remaining Dispute (if any) that is not settled or not withdrawn shall be opted out of arbitration and may proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with the remainder of these Terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, counsel for the parties may mutually agree in writing to proceed with the adjudication of some or all of the remaining disputes in individual arbitrations consistent with the process set forth in Stage Two (except Disputes shall be randomly selected and mediation shall be elective by agreement of counsel) or through another mutually agreeable process. A court of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority to enforce the Additional Procedures for Multiple Case Filings, including the power to enjoin the filing or prosecution of arbitrations and the assessment or collection of arbitration fees. The Additional Procedures for Multiple Case Filings provision and each of its requirements are essential parts of this Arbitration Agreement. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, either an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction decides that the Additional Procedures for Multiple Case Filings apply to your dispute and are not enforceable, then your dispute shall not proceed in arbitration and shall only proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with the remainder of the Terms.

(iv) Timing of Bellwether Arbitrations. The parties shall work in good faith with the arbitrator to complete each Bellwether Arbitration (in each respective stage, i.e., Stage One, Stage Two, and, if agreed, subsequent stages) within one hundred and twenty (120) calendar days of its initial pre-hearing conference. The parties agree that the Bellwether Arbitration process is designed to achieve an overall faster, more efficient, and less costly mechanism for resolving Multiple Case Filings, including the claims of individuals who are not selected for a Bellwether Arbitration.

**E. Limitation on Injunctive Relief.** AS PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU CLAIM THAT YOU HAVE INCURRED ANY LOSS, DAMAGES, OR INJURIES IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, THEN THE LOSSES, DAMAGES, AND INJURIES WILL NOT BE DEEMED IRREPARABLE OR SUFFICIENT TO ENTITLE YOU TO AN INJUNCTION OR TO OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF OF ANY KIND.  THIS MEANS (WITHOUT LIMITATION) THAT, IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR CLAIM, YOU AGREE THAT YOU WILL NOT SEEK, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT BE PERMITTED TO OBTAIN, ANY COURT OR OTHER ACTION THAT MAY INTERFERE WITH OR PREVENT THE DEVELOPMENT OR EXPLOITATION OF ANY WEBSITE, APPLICATION, CONTENT, UGC, PRODUCT, SERVICE, OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNED, LICENSED, USED, OR CONTROLLED BY ANY TELEGRAPH PARTY (DEFINED BELOW) (INCLUDING YOUR LICENSED UGC) OR A LICENSOR OF ANY TELEGRAPH PARTY.  

**F.   Governing Law.**  These Terms and any applicable Additional Terms, General Disputes and IP Disputes, and any other claim brought by you against Telegraph or by Telegraph against you pursuant to this Section, or otherwise related to the Service, Content, Telegraph Licensed Elements, UGC or other Telegraph products or services, will be governed by, construed, and resolved in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, U.S.A., without regard to its conflicts of law provisions that might apply the laws of another jurisdiction. This Section shall be governed solely by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §1, et seq., and not by the law of any state, and is enforceable pursuant to its terms on a self-executing basis. You and Telegraph agree that we intend that this Section satisfies the “writing” requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act.  This Section 8 can only be amended by mutual agreement.  Either party may seek enforcement of this Section 8 in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall determine any and all challenges to the arbitrability of a claim. 

**G.   Class Action Waiver.**   As permitted by applicable law, both you and Telegraph waive the right to bring any Dispute as a class, consolidated, representative, collective, or private attorney general action, or to participate in a class, consolidated, representative, collective, or private attorney general action regarding any Dispute brought by anyone else. Notwithstanding any provision in the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures to the contrary, the arbitrator shall not have the authority or any jurisdiction to hear the arbitration as a class, consolidated, representative, or private attorney general action or to consolidate, join, or otherwise combine the Disputes of different persons into one proceeding. Notwithstanding the arbitration provision set forth above, if the provision regarding waiver of class, collective, representative, and private attorney general claims of this Section is found to be void or otherwise unenforceable, any such class, collective, representative, or private attorney general claims must be heard and determined through an appropriate court proceeding, and not in arbitration.

**H.   Jury Waiver.   AS PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO ALL CLAIMS AND ISSUES ARISING UNDER, IN CONNECTION WITH, TOUCHING UPON OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS, THE BREACH THEREOF AND/OR THE SCOPE OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION, WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT OR TORT, AND INCLUDING ANY CLAIM FOR FRAUDULENT INDUCEMENT THEREOF.**  

**I.   Small Claims Matters.**  Notwithstanding the foregoing, either of us may bring qualifying claim of General Dispute (but not IP Disputes) in small claims court, subject to Section 8.

**J.**   The provisions of this Section shall supersede any inconsistent provisions of any prior agreement between the parties. This Section shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any termination of your use of the Service or these Terms.

**9\.   DISCLAIMER OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.**
