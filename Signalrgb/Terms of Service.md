The Application and SignalRGB Services together are hereinafter collectively referred to as the "**SignalRGB**".

When these Terms mention "**Whirlwind FX**," "**we**," "**us**," or "**our**," it refers to the Whirlwind FX company you are contracting with.

Our limited collection and use of personal information in connection with access to and use of the SignalRGB Platform is described in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.whirlwindfx.com/pages/privacy).

Any and all payment processing services through or in connection with your use of the SignalRGB Platform ("**Payment Services**") are provided to you by one or more SignalRGB Payments entities (individually and collectively, as appropriate, "SignalRGB **Payments**").

Members alone are responsible for identifying, understanding, and complying with all laws, rules and regulations that apply to their use of the SignalRGB Platform. If you have questions about how local laws apply to your Member Content on Whirlwind FX, you should always seek legal guidance.

**1\. Scope of SignalRGB** **Services**

1.1 The SignalRGB Platform offers its users smart-device software and hardware products designed to provide immersive gaming and video experiences. This is accomplished through the SignalRGB Platform by enabling its users ("**Members**" or "**Customers**" or "**Subscribers**") to utilize screen-analysis technology with paired computer peripheral devices such as keyboards and mice to produce RGB LED and other lighting effects that respond to on-screen events.

1.2 Members alone are responsible for their use of the SignalRGB Platform. Whirlwind FX is not and does not become a party to or other participant in any contractual relationship between Members and other providers of computer peripheral devices or other third parties. Nor is Whirlwind FX a broker or insurer. Whirlwind FX is not acting as an agent in any capacity for any Member or third party.

1.3 Whirlwind FX has no control over and does not guarantee (i) the existence, quality, safety, suitability, or legality of any Members' third-party agreements, (ii) the truth or accuracy of any descriptions or other Member Content (as defined below), or (iii) the performance or conduct of any Member or third party. Whirlwind FX does not endorse any Member or Member Content.

1.4 If you choose to use the SignalRGB Platform as a Member (as defined below), your relationship with Whirlwind FX is limited to being an independent, third-party user, and not an employee, agent, joint-venture or partner of Whirlwind FX for any reason, and you act exclusively on your own behalf and for your own benefit, and not on behalf, or for the benefit, of Whirlwind FX.

1.5 Whirlwind FX retains all Intellectual Property ownership rights of all Member Content created by Members through the use of the SignalRGB Platform.

**Customer**

1.6 The SignalRGB Platform may contain links to third-party websites or resources ("**Third-Party Services**"). Such Third-Party Services may be subject to different terms and conditions and privacy practices. Whirlwind FX is not responsible or liable for the availability or accuracy of such Third-Party Services, or the content, products, or services available from such Third-Party Services. Links to such Third-Party Services are not an endorsement by Whirlwind FX of such Third-Party Services.

1.7 Due to the nature of the Internet, Whirlwind FX cannot guarantee the continuous and uninterrupted availability and accessibility of the SignalRGB Platform. Whirlwind FX may restrict the availability of the SignalRGB Platform or certain areas or features thereof, if this is necessary in view of capacity limits, the security or integrity of our servers, or to carry out maintenance measures that ensure the proper or improved functioning of the SignalRGB Platform. Whirlwind FX may improve, enhance and modify the SignalRGB Platform and introduce new SignalRGB Services from time to time.

If there is a conflict between these Terms and Conditions applicable to a specific area or feature of the SignalRGB Platform, the latter terms and conditions will take precedence with respect to your access to or use of that area or feature, unless specified otherwise.

2.5 When you access the Website, download / install the Application, or use our hardware products, you agree to the terms and services or other applicable binding agreement of the platform, product or service through which you are accessing or downloading, including any browser, application store, device, or other platform.

If you disagree with the revised Terms, you may terminate this Agreement with immediate effect. We will inform you about your right to terminate the Agreement in the notification email.

**12\. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement**

12.1 This Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Agreement shall apply if you (i) reside in the United States; or (ii) do not reside in the United States, but bring any claim against Whirlwind FX in the United States.

12.2 _Overview of Dispute Resolution Process_. Whirlwind FX is committed to participating in a consumer-friendly dispute resolution process. To that end, these Terms provide for a two-part process for individuals to whom Section 19.1 applies: (1) an informal negotiation directly with Whirlwind FX's customer service team, and (2) a binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association ("**AAA**") using its specially designed Consumer Arbitration Rules. Specifically, the process provides:

* Claims can be filed with AAA online ([www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/cs/idcplg?IdcService=GET_FILE&dDocName=ADRSTAGE2034889&RevisionSelectionMethod=LatestReleased));

* Arbitrators must be neutral and no party may unilaterally select an arbitrator;

* Arbitrators must disclose any bias, interest in the result of the arbitration, or relationship with any party;

* Parties retain the right to seek relief in small claims court for certain claims, at their option;

* The initial filing fee for the consumer is capped at $200;

* The consumer gets to elect the hearing location and can elect to participate live, by phone, video conference, or, for claims under $25,000, by the submission of documents;

* The arbitrator can grant any remedy that the parties could have received in court to resolve the party's individual claim.

12.3 _Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution and Notification_. Prior to initiating an arbitration, you and Whirlwind FX each agree to notify the other party of the dispute and attempt to negotiate an informal resolution to it first. We will contact you at the email address you have provided to us; you can contact Whirlwind FX's customer service team by emailing us. If after a good faith effort to negotiate one of us feels the dispute has not and cannot be resolved informally, the party intending to pursue arbitration agrees to notify the other party via email prior to initiating the arbitration. In order to initiate arbitration, a claim must be filed with the AAA and the written Demand for Arbitration (available at [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/cs/idcplg?IdcService=GET_FILE&dDocName=ADRSTAGE2034889&RevisionSelectionMethod=LatestReleased)) provided to the other party, as specified in the AAA Rules.

**12.4 _Agreement to Arbitrate_. You and Whirlwind FX mutually agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement or interpretation thereof, or to the use of the SignalRGB Platform, the Member Content (collectively, "Disputes") will be settled by binding arbitration (the "Arbitration Agreement"). If there is a dispute about whether this Arbitration Agreement can be enforced or applies to our Dispute, you and Whirlwind FX agree that the arbitrator will decide that issue.**

12.5 _Exceptions to Arbitration Agreement_. You and Whirlwind FX each agree that the following claims are exceptions to the Arbitration Agreement and will be brought in a judicial proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction: (i) Any claim related to actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights; (ii) Any claim seeking emergency injunctive relief based on exigent circumstances (e.g., imminent danger or commission of a crime, hacking, cyber-attack).

**12.6 _Jury Trial Waiver_. You and Whirlwind FX acknowledge and agree that we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury as to all arbitrable Disputes.**

**12.7 _No Class Actions or Representative Proceedings_. You and Whirlwind FX acknowledge and agree that we are each waiving the right to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action lawsuit, class-wide arbitration, private attorney-general action, or any other representative proceeding as to all Disputes. Further, unless you and Whirlwind FX** **both otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one party's claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this paragraph is held unenforceable with respect to any Dispute, then the entirety of the Arbitration Agreement will be deemed void with respect to such Dispute.**

12.8 _Severability_. In the event that any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed illegal or unenforceable, such provision shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall be given full force and effect.

**13\. Feedback**

13.1 We welcome and encourage you to provide feedback, comments and suggestions for improvements to the SignalRGB Platform ("**Feedback**"). You may submit Feedback by emailing us, through the "Contact" section of the SignalRGB Platform, or by other means of communication. Any Feedback you submit to us will be considered non-confidential and non-proprietary to you. By submitting Feedback to us, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, sub-licensable, perpetual license to use and publish those ideas and materials for any purpose, without compensation to you.

**14\. Applicable Law and Jurisdiction**

14.1 If you reside in the United States, these Terms will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California and the United States of America, without regard to conflict-of-law provisions. Judicial proceedings (other than small claims actions) that are excluded from the Arbitration Agreement in Section 12 must be brought in state or federal court in the State of California, unless we both agree to some other location. You and we both consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in the State of California.

**15\. General Provisions**

15.1 Except as they may be supplemented by additional terms and conditions, policies, guidelines, these Terms constitute the entire Agreement between Whirlwind FX and you pertaining to the subject matter hereof, and supersede any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Whirlwind FX and you in relation to the access to and use of the SignalRGB Platform.

15.2 No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and Whirlwind FX as a result of this Agreement or your use of the SignalRGB Platform.

15.3 These Terms do not and are not intended to confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than the parties.

15.4 If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision will be struck and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions.

15.5 Whirlwind FX's failure to enforce any right or provision in these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by us in writing. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise permitted under law.

15.6 You may not assign, transfer or delegate this Agreement and your rights and obligations hereunder without Whirlwind FX's prior written consent. Whirlwind FX may without restriction assign, transfer or delegate this Agreement and any rights and obligations hereunder, at its sole discretion, with 30 days prior notice. Your right to terminate this Agreement at any time remains unaffected.

15.7 Unless specified otherwise, any notices or other communications to Members permitted or required under this Agreement, will be in writing and given by Whirlwind FX via email, SignalRGB Platform notification, or messaging service (including SMS and social media applications).
