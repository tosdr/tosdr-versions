When you view our websites, we or our third-party service provider may store some information on your computer in the form of a "cookie" or similar file. Cookies allow us and our third-party service providers to recognize when you use or return to our website or how you use our website. For example, in order to tailor our website or promotions to better match your interests and preferences or to enable functionality of pop-up customer surveys. Under certain circumstances, we permit these third-party service providers to collect information on our website for their own business purposes using cookies or other similar technologies. Most Internet browsers enable you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions.

Giant Tiger may tie non-personal information that we collect automatically (such as the type of internet browser that you use) to Personal Information that you provide to us with your consent (such as when you create or use your GT ID account).  

We use third-party service providers to place ads that we think will interest you on Giant Tiger or other websites (interest-based advertising, also called online behavioural advertising).

Shopify Audiences also respects the Global Privacy Control settings in most browsers to prevent Shopify Audiences tracking.

We use Shopify Audiences to help us show ads on other websites with our advertising partners to buyers who made purchases with other Shopify merchants and who may also be interested in what we have to offer. We also share information about your use of the website, your purchases and the email address associated with your purchases with Shopify Audiences, through which other Shopify merchants may make offers you may be interested in.

We use Google Analytics to collect non-personal information on visitors to our website in order to provide us with statistics on website activity.

F. Retention of Personal Information
------------------------------------

Your Personal Information is retained only as long as necessary for the fulfillment of the purposes for which it was collected, except where otherwise necessary to comply with legal requirements. We may keep your Personal Information for a reasonable time afterwards in the event that you wish to resume service.

Most Internet browsers enable you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions. To learn more about how to block, delete and manage cookies on your computer, please see the below links based on the browser type you are using:
    * [Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies)
    * [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en)

* We use third-party service providers to place ads that we think will interest you on Giant Tiger or other websites (interest-based advertising, also called online behavioural advertising). To learn more about how our third-party service providers use web beacons or cookies for behavioural advertising and to manage your choices (e.g., opt in or opt out) for this type of advertising, you can visit the Interactive Advertising Bureau of Canada Website ([https://iabcanada.com/](https://iabcanada.com/)).

I. Passwords
------------

Giant Tiger uses reasonable and appropriate security safeguards to protect the privacy, confidentiality, and integrity of GT ID accounts. You are responsible for the security of your GT ID account and for protecting your password. For example, do not write down or share your GT ID account password with anyone, and do not save your GT ID account information on a shared or public computer. Giant Tiger will not be liable for any losses, damages or expenses arising out of or relating to any unauthorized use of such account or password. If you believe your GT ID account has been compromised, immediately contact our Privacy Office.

J. Payment Information Security
-------------------------------

We value the security and privacy of all transactions made with Giant Tiger. We use Secure Sockets Layer (“SSL”) technology to protect the security of your payment card information (“PCI”), such as debit and credit card information, as it is transmitted through us to our third party payment providers. All third party payment processors maintain PCI DSS and SOC2 compliance.

When you make a purchase, all of your Personal Information is encrypted, including credit and debit card number, name and address. SSL is the industry standard for secure commerce transactions. It prevents your Personal Information from being read by someone else as it travels across the Internet. While we implement the above security measures on our websites, there is always a risk of a breach of security safeguards.

K. Links to Other Websites
--------------------------

Our website may contain links to other websites, including content from other websites that is occasionally framed within Giant Tiger’s websites.

* For example, our website contains a link to Giant Tiger’s Facebook page. If you click this link ([https://www.facebook.com/GiantTiger](https://www.facebook.com/GiantTiger)) it will take you away from the Giant Tiger website, to Facebook, where your information may be subject to Facebook’s privacy policies.

Please note that the privacy policies applicable to the collection of Personal Information on those other websites may be different from this one and we have no control or responsibility for the privacy practices of third party websites. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of all websites you visit, before you share any Personal Information on a website.

L. Social Media Plug-Ins
------------------------

We have installed on our websites various social media plug-in protocols, such as a Facebook “Like” button, which allow you to share your likes and interests in Giant Tiger’s products, services and promotions with your friends and contacts. When you click on a social media plug-in protocol link while on our website, such as the “Like” button, a link to our website may appear in the “Likes and Interests” section of your Facebook or other social media profiles.

Depending on your social media privacy preferences, your friends, contacts, or other individuals or organizations may be able to see the link and be led back to our website if they share your likes and interests or if they are interested in learning more about our products, services and promotions.

When you use a social media plug-in protocol link from our website, we may use information on your likes and interests in connection with the marketing and promotion of our business.

For more information about social media plug-in protocols, such as the Facebook “Like” button and its impact on your privacy rights, please visit the appropriate social media help center (e.g., Facebook’s Help Center at [https://www.facebook.com/help/](https://www.facebook.com/help/)). To change your privacy settings on Facebook, including who can view your activity when using your Facebook account, visit: [https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=privacy](https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=privacy).

M. Privacy Policy Revisions

We may change or add to this Privacy Policy from time to time, so we encourage you to review it periodically. Revisions may reflect changes in how we collect, use, share and protect your Personal Information, as well as changes in our legal or regulatory obligations.
