2.2.      Information Collected Automatically.  Whenever you interact with our Services, we may automatically receive and record information from your browser or device.  Usage Data may sometimes be essentially anonymous or aggregated when collected, but could be used indirectly to identify a person. Such Usage Data may include:

2.3.      Tracking Options; Do Not Track Disclosures.  Some web browsers incorporate a "Do Not Track" feature that signals to websites and Services that you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. Each browser communicates "Do Not Track" signals to websites differently, making it unworkable to honor each and every request correctly. In order to alleviate any communication error between browsers and our Services, our Services do not support "Do Not Track" signals or requests at this time. As the technology and communication between browser and website improves, we may elect in our discretion to reevaluate the ability to honor "Do Not Track" signals and may make changes to our policy. You may adjust your browser or operating system settings to limit this tracking or to decline cookies, but by doing so, you may not be able to use certain features on the Services or take full advantage of all of our offerings. Check the “Help” menu of your browser or operating system to learn how to adjust your tracking settings or cookie preferences. To learn more about the use of cookies or other technologies to deliver more relevant advertising and your choices about not having this information used by certain Service Providers (defined below), please click [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/). Note that our systems may not recognize Do Not Track headers or requests from some or all browsers.

2.4.     Personal Data.  In some countries or jurisdictions, including in the European Economic Area (EEA) or the State of California, some Personal Information (as defined above)      may be considered “personal data” under applicable data protection laws. Please consult **Sections** **6 and 7** for more details.

3.2.      Cookies.  We may use cookies, flash cookies, local shared objects, web beacons, pixels, single pixel GIFs, clear GIFs, and other technologies, along with your Personal Information, to enhance and personalize your experience and gather information that helps us optimize our Services. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features. This Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third-parties, and we are not responsible for their respective privacy statements or practices. We use the following types of cookies on the Site and Services:

(a)   _Session cookies_, which exist only during an online session. They may disappear from your computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer. We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged into the Site or otherwise utilizing the Services. This allows us to process your online transactions and requests and to verify your identity, as you move through our Services     .

(b)   _Persistent cookies_, which may remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer. We use persistent cookies to track and aggregate statistical information about user activity, and to display advertising on third-party sites.

(c)   _Advertising cookies_, which are used to serve you personalized online ads. Your browser is assigned a pseudonymous ID, used to track the ads that have been served to your browser, and to identify those on which you’ve clicked. These providers may use cookies to select and serve you ads when you click on ads that appear on the Site or other Services, and based on your browsing behavior. You can opt\-out of advertising cookies as described in **Section 4.4**.

(d)   _Analytics cookies_, which are used to compile aggregate and statistical data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer a better website experience and tools in the future. Typically, these “analytics” cookies do not need access to Personal Information for their operations. We may contract with third-party service providers to provide these analytics services. They are contractually prohibited from using Personal Information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our business. We use Google Analytics to provide these analytics services. You can opt out of Google Analytics accessing your information at [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

4.  SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION
===============================

4.1.       General Disclosure Policy.  We may share your Personal Information with certain third-parties to provide products and services that you have requested, when we have your consent, or as otherwise described in this Policy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we reserve the right to disclose Usage Data without restriction. We reserve the right to disclose or use Personal Information as described below.

4.2.     De-Identified Information.  We may de-identify your Personal Information so that you are not identified as an individual, and we may share such aggregated, non-personally identifiable information, publicly or with our partners like publishers, advertisers, or connected websites (e.g., sharing information publicly to show trends about the general use of our Site or other Services).

4.3.      User Profiles and Submissions.  Certain user profile information (e.g., your name, location, and any text, image, or video content that you have uploaded to the Services) may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction or to address your request for our Services. Your account privacy settings may allow you to limit the other users who can see Personal Information in your user profile and/or what information in your user profile is visible to others. Please remember that any content you upload to your public user profile, along with any other Personal Information or content that you voluntarily disclose online in a manner in which other users can view (e.g., on discussion boards, in messages or chat areas) becomes publicly available, and it may be indexable by search engines, or copied, forwarded, saved, or archived by anyone. Your username may also be displayed to other users if you send messages or comments, upload text or images, or share features publicly (e.g., a public watchlist) through the Services, and other users may be able to contact you through messages or comments.

4.4.     Advertisers.

(a)   Your Personal Information may be used for the presentation of advertisements. We may use ad networks to customize and display advertising on our Services. We may share certain information about you as a user (e.g., age, zip code, or other information we have collected or received) with certain ad networks and service providers to help them deliver more relevant content and advertisements through their networks. We may work with other companies for certain services, such as analytics or advertising, and you may be subject to their privacy policies as well, though you may be able to opt-out through them directly.

(b)   To learn more about targeted advertising and advertising networks, or about your ability to opt-out of collection of information by certain third-parties, please visit the opt-out pages of the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1) or the [Digital Advertising Alliance](https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN). Please note that opting-out of advertising cookies does not mean that you will not be served ads; you will continue to receive non-personalized ads.

(c)   We may deliver a files to you, through the Services from an ad network, called web beacons. Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research, and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network’s servers, these companies can view, edit, or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. You may be able to opt-out of web beacon tracking conducted by third-parties through our Services by adjusting the Do Not Track settings on your browser; please note that we don’t control whether or how these third-parties comply with Do Not Track requests.

(d)   Our offerings may include features or functionalities provided by third-parties, or may integrate or interact with third-party products and services (including via APIs, plug-ins, links, frames, embedding, or other interactions). In the process of providing such functionalities within our Services, your browser or other tools or technology may send certain information to those third-party providers. The use of these third-party-provided features or functionalities may be subject to those third parties’ own privacy policies. For example, we may use a third-party for ad serving, retargeting, remarketing, and/or for analytics, in which case such third-party may have access to your data, subject to its policies. These third-party vendors may use their own cookies and/or other third-party cookies together to (i) inform, optimize, and serve ads across the web based on your past visits to our Services and others; and (ii) report to us how your ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our site. If and to the extent from time to time we use Double Click or another Google brand for ad serving, analytics, remarketing, retargeting, etc., you can set certain preferences and opt-outs using Google [Ads Settings](https://www.google.com/settings/ads), and Google Analytics’ [currently available opt-outs](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/), found at [https://www.google.com/ads/preferences](https://www.google.com/ads/preferences/) and [https://adssettings.google.com](https://adssettings.google.com/).

4.5.      Affiliated Entities.  We reserve the right to provide your Personal Information and Usage Data to any affiliated entities we may have, including our subsidiaries. Affiliated entities are entities that we control, that control us, or with which we are subject to common control by another entity.

4.6.     Business Partners.  Business partners or other third-parties may receive data about groups of our users, but, except as otherwise permitted herein, do not receive Personal Information of individual users. In certain situations, businesses or third-party websites we are affiliated with may offer or provide products or services to you, through or in connection with, the Services (either alone or jointly with us). We may share your Personal Information with these affiliated businesses only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service. We have no control over the policies and practices of third-party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such related policies.

4.7.     Service Providers.  We reserve the right to provide access to your Personal Information and Usage Data to our trusted service providers that assist us with the operation and maintenance of our Site and other Services. We may contract with third-parties to process payments, host our servers, or to provide security, production, fulfillment, optimization, analytics, reporting, legal, accounting, Internet, and other services. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that our service providers will be given access to your Personal Information only as is reasonably necessary to provide the services for which they are contracted. Some examples of such service providers are the following:

(a)   Messari’s _Slack integration_ makes it seamless to receive real-time updates on crypto assets directly into a user’s Slack workspace. In order to provide these updates, Messari may request certain permissions from Slack, including information about (i) the channels available within the workspace, (ii) access tokens, and (iii) application settings, including which channels have been white-listed and configured as the target for an alert policy. Each member’s Slack integration is managed by the associated Messari Enterprise account and may be uninstalled at any time at the respective administrator’s discretion. Messari does not have access to member names, messages, or Personal Information related to member(s), including individual user names or associated email addresses. Copies of data may be retained for backup purposes for a maximum of 30 days after account deletion or when integration is removed. Data may be deleted sooner upon user request. You may also be subject to Slack’s privacy policy, available [here](https://slack.com/trust/privacy/privacy-policy#rights).

(b)   Messari may use _HubSpot trackers_ or _Salesforce trackers_ to collect Personal Information and Usage Data using cookies. Please refer to **Section 3.2** to read more about cookies.

4.8.     Co-Marketers; Cross-Promotion; Sponsorships.  We may participate with another company or individual, for the purposes of jointly promoting our Services, promotions, or contests, or their products, services, promotions, or contests. We reserve the right to disclose Personal Information to them for the purposes of (i) compensation, transaction-processing, fulfillment, and support; and (ii) offering you other products, services, promotions, or contests. These marketing partners may also contact you about other or related products, services, promotions, or contests.

4.9.     Business Transfers; Successors.  We may choose to buy or sell assets or other interests in third-parties and may share or transfer Personal Information in connection with the evaluation of, and entry into, such transactions. Also, if we (or all or some of our assets or other interests) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third-party. If such an action results in a material change in the use of your Personal Information, you will be provided notice (which may be via updates to this page) about your potential ability to decline to permit such a transfer.

4.10.   Legal Process, Enforcement, and Security Notice.  Notwithstanding anything in this Policy to the contrary, we reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any Personal Information under the following circumstances:

(a)   To satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request (e.g., to comply with a subpoena or court order);

9.  INFORMATION SECURITY
========================

9.1.       Our Commitment to Security.  We have established commercially reasonable safeguards to protect the Personal Information we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction, but we cannot guarantee that your Personal Information will never be disclosed in a manner inconsistent with this Policy (e.g., as a result of unauthorized acts by third-parties that violate applicable law, or our or our affiliated providers’ policies). Please be aware that despite our efforts, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security.

9.2.      Your Obligations.  Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. (We may use passwords and other technologies to register or authenticate you and to enable you to take advantage of our Services.) You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and by limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing-off after you have finished accessing your account. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords, or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.

10.DATA STORAGE AND RETENTION
=============================

10.1.     General Information.  Your Personal Information is stored and processed in our servers located in the United States and may also be stored or processed in other countries by our service providers, if and to the extent compliant with law. You understand and agree that Messari may collect, use, disclose, and otherwise utilize the information you provide as described in this Policy, even if you are from an area outside the United States. Your Personal Information may be disclosed in response to inquiries or requests from governmental authorities or to respond to judicial process in the United States or other jurisdictions. We will retain your Personal Information for as long as it is needed to provide you with the Services, or to fulfill any legal or contractual obligations we may have.

10.2.    Notice for EEA Users.  Your Personal Information may be transferred to and processed in the United States, which has data protection laws that are different from those in your country and may not be as protective.

11. GENERAL

11.1.      Contact Us. 

(a)   If you would like to make a request to download, transfer, delete or update your Personal Information, please submit a request through our [Privacy Request Form](https://preferences.messari.io/privacy).

(b)   To “opt-out” under the CCPA, please submit a request through our [Right to Opt-Out Form](https://preferences.messari.io/dont_sell).

(d)   Note that we may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, risk the privacy of others, require disproportionate technical effort (e.g., developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), or would otherwise be extremely impractical (e.g., requests for information residing in backup storage that is not easily accessible).

11.2.     Changes to this Policy.  We may update our Privacy Policy from time, and so you should review this Policy periodically. We may reach out to you on the Services, by email notification, or by some other means to inform you of any changes to the Policy. If you have opted not to receive legal notice emails from us, or you haven’t provided your email address, those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding the Policy. Your continued use of the Services constitutes your acceptance of any such changes.
