Contain a class action waiver and an agreement to resolve any disputes that may arise by arbitration; and

**3.**             **Company Rights**

**3.1.     No Obligation**

Company has no obligation to monitor the Services. However, you acknowledge and agree that Company has the right to monitor the Services electronically from time to time, and to disclose any information as necessary or appropriate to satisfy any law, regulation, or other governmental request; to operate the Services properly; or to protect itself or its customers. Company reserves the right to refuse to post or to remove any information or materials, in whole or in part, that, in its sole discretion, are unacceptable, undesirable, inappropriate, or in violation of these Terms.

**4.**             **Disclaimers**

**4.1.     This Is Not Financial Advice**

The Services, and the content, information, and tools therein, are provided for educational, informational, and entertainment purposes only. We are not securities brokers/dealers, cryptoasset brokers/dealers, investment advisers, commodity trading advisors, or financial advisers, analysts, or planners of any kind. We are neither licensed nor qualified to provide investment or trading advice. The information contained within the Services is not an offer to buy or sell any cryptoassets, commodities, and/or securities. Nothing within the Services or on its associated websites takes into account the particular investment objectives, financial situations, or needs of individuals; therefore, the information therein should not be construed as a personal recommendation.  For purposes of these Terms, “cryptoasset” means “any digital asset (including a virtual currency or virtual commodity) which is a digital representation of value based on (or built on top of) a cryptographic protocol of a computer network.”

**4.2.     We Are Not Soliciting Any Action** 

The information provided on the Services does not constitute investment advice, financial advice, trading advice, or any other sort of advice, and you should not treat any of the website's content as such. We do not recommend that any cryptoassets, commodities, and/or securities should be bought, sold, or held by you. Conduct your own due diligence and consult your financial advisor before making any investment decisions.

**4.3.     Do Your Own Due Diligence** 

The information provided on the Services not intended as a complete source of information on any particular company, investment, asset or market. An individual should never make investment decisions based solely on information contained within our Services or associated media (or any service, website, book, tool or app, for that matter). All users should assume that ALL INFORMATION PROVIDED REGARDING COMPANIES, INVESTMENTS, ASSETS OR MARKETS IS NOT TRUSTWORTHY UNLESS VERIFIED BY THEIR OWN INDEPENDENT RESEARCH.

**4.4.     Reliability of Data** 

The contents of the Services and any associated media—data, text, graphics, links and other materials—are based on public information that we do not control. We do not represent that the content of the Services is accurate or complete, and it should not be relied on as such. The Services and associated media may contain inaccuracies, typographical errors, and other errors. All information and materials are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis, without warranty or condition of any kind either expressed or implied. We do not warrant the quality, accuracy, reliability, adequacy, or completeness of any of such information and material, and expressly disclaim any liability for errors or omissions in such information and material. You understand that you are using any and all information available here at your own risk. Opinions expressed herein are merely opinions and merely as of the date of publication of those opinions, and may or may not be updated.

**4.5.     Investing in Cryptoassets Is High Risk** 

Any individual who chooses to invest in cryptoassets should do so with caution. Investing in cryptoassets is speculative and carries a high degree of risk; you may lose some or all of the money that is invested, and if you engage in margin transactions, your loss may exceed the amount invested.

**4.6.     Past Performance Is No Guarantee of Future Results** 

Trading results can never be guaranteed. You should be suspicious of anyone who promises you guaranteed results. The information provided on the Services and associated media regarding the past performance of any cryptoassets, or strategy is only representative of historical conditions in the marketplace and is not to be construed as a guarantee that such conditions will exist in the future or that such performance will be achieved in the future. The price and value of investments referred to in the Services and associated media, and the income from them may go down as well as up, and investors may realize losses on any investments. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Future returns are not guaranteed, and a loss of original capital may occur.

**4.7.     Suitability of Strategies Is Personal to Your Circumstances** 

The Services described herein may describe cryptoassets not suitable for all investors and not be suitable for you or your situation. You should seek advice from an independent financial advisor. None of the content published in the Services constitutes a recommendation that any particular cryptoasset, security, commodity, portfolio of securities, portfolio of commodities, transaction, or investment strategy is suitable for any specific person. We are not advising you personally concerning the nature, potential, value, or suitability of any particular cryptoasset, security, commodity, portfolio of securities, portfolio of commodities, transaction, investment strategy, or other matter.

**4.8.     Consider Other Relevant Factors** 

While the Services may be of use to investors, traders, and others in evaluating certain information about cryptoassets it should not be considered to include every factor that may be necessary for an investor or trader to make a decision to invest or trade. A decision to invest or trade in a particular cryptoasset may be based on a number of factors, including investors’ needs, goals, and comfort with risk. Before making an investment decision you should read all available disclosures published by the issuer. Please also consider risks associated with the trading of cryptoassets including volatility in the market and in individual assets. The Services may provide results that identify cryptoassets by name, and each name may contain a hyperlink to additional information. The additional information may include, among other things, price and performance information, and financial/accounting ratios. The Services are highly dependent upon data provided by third parties, and we cannot guarantee such data’s accuracy, timeliness, or fitness for a specific purpose. The data is subject to change and revision by the third-party data providers. As with any investments through any source, you must decide for yourself if an investment in any cryptoassets is consistent with your evaluation of the asset, your investment objectives, your risk tolerance, your investment time frame, and your financial situation. By making information about investments available, we, and the Services, are not recommending or endorsing it.

**4.9.   Use Qualified Advisors** 

We are not providing any financial or investment advice or services via the Services and should not be relied upon as a substitute for consultations with qualified professionals who are familiar with your individual needs. Please consult your accountant, tax advisor, stockbroker, and/or financial advisor as necessary. You acknowledge that the information on the Website and other Services is provided “as is” for general information only. You may use the Services for informational purposes only, as an aid, but only as one information source among many, and not as the sole basis for making any decisions; you should always conduct proper due diligence and use your own judgment when making any decisions based on any information, analytics, or reports derived from the Services.

**4.10.   For Advisors or Brokers**

If you use the Services to provide any services to any third parties, such as, without limitation, if you are an investment adviser, trading advisor, or broker of any kind, you are fully responsible for all services and recommendations, and represent and warrant that you are appropriately qualified and certified to do so, possessing all necessary licenses and permits to do so. You will not state nor imply to any customer or client any responsibility of us for any decisions or recommendations. In addition: (a) you (and not we) are solely responsible for all advice, recommendations, or services you provide to your clients, even if you use our Services in whole or in part to create such advice; (b) we have no liability whatsoever to your clients; (c) we are not responsible for any disputes between you and your clients; (d) you will not state or imply to your clients anything contrary to all disclaimers, warranty limitations, and limitations of liability, by us herein or otherwise with respect to the Services.

**4.11.   Additional Services**

We may from time to time offer products and services as part of the Services that provide you with additional features and functionality, including, without limitation, the ability to participate in on-chain governance for supported cryptocurrency assets via governance tooling (through our product currently referred to as “Governor” or “Governance by Messari”). You may participate in these and similar Messari products and services by linking your digital wallets on supported bridge extensions (e.g., MetaMask), provided that you have downloaded a supported electronic wallet extension. Any transactions initiated through the Services are facilitated and run by third-party electronic wallet extensions and subject to the terms and conditions and privacy policies of those third-party products and services and Messari shall have no liability with respect to the use of those third-party products or services. For the avoidance of doubt, we do not store, send, or receive any cryptoassets, and any transfer of ownership takes place outside of the Services.

**4.12.   Use of Artificial Intelligence**

At Messari, we may use artificial intelligence (“**AI**”) to improve or create content, along with human workers, in connection with the Services. By using the Services, you acknowledge that content partially or wholly created using AI may be included in some of Messari's offerings.

**5.**             **Account Access and Fees**

**5.1.     Registration**

If we believe the information you provide is not correct, current, or complete, we have the right to refuse you access to the Services or any of its resources, and to terminate or suspend your access at any time, without notice.

You must notify Company immediately of any breach of security, or unauthorized use of your account. Although Company will not be liable for your losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account, you may be liable for the losses of Company or others due to unauthorized use.

You agree not to download any content, software, or services unless you see a “download” or similar link displayed by Company on the Services for that content. You agree not to copy, reproduce, distribute, transmit, broadcast, display, sell, license, or otherwise exploit any content for any other purposes without the prior written consent of Company or the respective licensors of the content. Company and its licensors reserve all rights not expressly granted in and to the Services and their content.

**5.4.     Fees and Payments**

If and to the extent any portion of the Services may require a fee payment, incremental payment, or subscription, you agree to pay Company any applicable fees posted for the Services. By completing and submitting any credit card or other payment authorization through the Services, you are authorizing Company to charge the fees to the account you identify. You must keep all billing information, including payment method, up to date. You agree to pay us for all charges incurred under your account, including all applicable taxes, fees, and surcharges. You authorize and direct us to charge your designated payment method for these charges or, if your designated payment method fails, to charge any other payment method you have on file with your account. Further, you authorize and direct us to retain information about the payment method(s) associated with your account. If we do not receive payment from your designated payment method or any other payment method on file, you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand by us. You will be responsible for accrued but unpaid charges, even if your account is canceled by you or terminated by us. During any free trial or other promotion, if any, you will still be responsible for any purchases and surcharges incurred using your account.

**5.5.     Nonpayment** 

After 30 days from the date of any unpaid charges, your fee-based Services will be deemed delinquent, and we may terminate or suspend your account and Services for nonpayment. We reserve the right to assess an additional 1.5% late charge (or the highest amount allowed by law, whichever is lower) per month if your payment is more than 30 days past due, and to use any lawful means to collect any unpaid charges. You are liable for any fees, including attorney and collection fees, incurred by us in our efforts to collect any remaining balances from you. Except as otherwise mutually agreed in writing, we reserve the right to change our fees with 30 days’ notice.

**5.6.     Refunds**

If you are a subscriber, you may access or modify your subscription level on the Messari.io dashboard at any time.

Limitations: We are not obligated to provide a refund or credit, for any reason whatsoever, if: you changed your mind about a product or subscription; you purchased a subscription by mistake; you failed to cancel your free trial before getting charged; you do not have sufficient expertise to use a product or subscription; OR you cannot access the product(s) or subscription due to your inability to log in, excluding extenuating circumstances that impact the broader subscriber base or community.

JAMS may be contacted at [www.jamsadr.com](http://www.jamsadr.com/). The arbitration will be conducted in Wilmington, Delaware, unless you and we agree otherwise. If you are using our Services for commercial purposes, each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules, and the award rendered by the arbitrator will include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If you are an individual using our Services for non-commercial purposes: (i) JAMS may require you to pay a fee for the initiation of your case, unless you apply for and successfully obtain a fee waiver from JAMS; (ii) the award rendered by the arbitrator may include your costs of arbitration, your reasonable attorney’s fees, and your reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses; and (iii) you may sue in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction without first engaging in arbitration, but this does not absolve you of your commitment to engage in the informal dispute resolution process. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. NOTHING IN THIS SECTION WILL BE DEEMED AS PREVENTING US FROM SEEKING INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF FROM THE COURTS AS NECESSARY TO PREVENT THE ACTUAL OR THREATENED INFRINGEMENT, MISAPPROPRIATION, OR VIOLATION OF OUR DATA SECURITY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, OR OTHER PROPRIETARY RIGHTS.
