5\. USE OF THE SERVICES
-----------------------

**5.1 Credits.** Your use of the Services is through the redemption of credits (the **“Credit/s”**). Each Credit can be used for a single page (containing up to 250 words). You may purchase as many Credits as you desire. Once the Credits on your Account run out, you will be required to acquire additional Credits to continue enjoying the Services. Copyleaks offer you the possibility of a “refill option”, allowing you an automatic refill of the exact amount of Credits you purchased, at the same price as the primary Credits you purchased. A detailed description of our Copyleaks accounts, including the prices and the features associated with each type of account, is available on our [Copyleaks Pricing page](https://copyleaks.com/pricing).

You may change the number of Credits on your Account at any time. Your Account will be updated immediately following such a change.

**5.3 Monthly Account.** You can also purchase a monthly subscription to the Services. Your Account will run from month to month (the **“Monthly Account”**) with the same number of Credits you selected to begin with. If you select a Monthly Account, you will have the same number of Credits each month, without the possibility of accumulating unused Credits of the previous month, and any such unused Credits shall be cancelled. Copyleaks will not refund any unused Credits that were cancelled. You may change the number of Credits on your Account at any time. Your Account will be updated immediately following such a change.

**5.4 API.** Copyleaks also offers you the Application Programming Interface (the **“API”**) which allows you to integrate our Services to your systems.

6\. AI CONTENT DETECTOR
-----------------------

Without derogating from these Terms , the following provisions shall apply specifically to any use by you of the Copyleaks AI Content Detector, including by way of sampling the AI Content Detector on the applicable webpage (e.g., at [https://copyleaks.com/ai-content-detector](https://copyleaks.com/ai-content-detector) or otherwise):

**6.1** Copyleaks AI Content Detector is a Copyleaks’ proprietary tool which, at the request of Copyleaks’ users, scans content provided by such user to the AI Content Detector and provides a score between 0 and 100 reflecting the _probability_ that the scanned content is generated by a human or an artificial intelligence (AI) tool.

**6.2** Copyleaks does not provide – and expressly disclaims – any warranty regarding the accuracy of the result provided by the AI Content Detector, which in some cases may incorrectly flag certain content as more likely to be AI-generated.

**6.3** The AI Content Detector is an assessment tool which in no way guarantees whether or not any given content was generated by a human or by AI, and any result provided by the AI Content Detector shall not constitute an endorsement or determination on the part of Copyleaks regarding whether or not the scanned content, or any part of it, was generated by human or by AI.

**6.4** Copyleaks shall in no way be liable for any action taken by you or any third party on the basis of a result provided by the AI Content Detector. You are solely responsible for any inquiry, investigation or other action taken by you on the basis of such result.

**6.5** To the extent the content you provided for a scan by the AI Content Detector is copied from a webpage – you alone shall be fully responsible for compliance with the terms of use of such third party webpage from which the content was copied, and Copyleaks disclaims any and all liability for any breach of such terms of use.

7\. GENERATIVE AI GRC

Without derogating from these Terms, the following provisions shall apply specifically to any use by you of the Copyleaks Generative AI GRC, including by way of sampling the Generative AI GRC on the applicable webpage (e.g., at [https://copyleaks.com/governance-risk-and-compliance](https://copyleaks.com/governance-risk-and-compliance) or otherwise):

**7.1** Copyleaks Generative AI GRC is a Copyleaks proprietary tool which, at the request of Copyleaks’ Generative AI GRC customers (the “Customer”), monitors and restricts the use of certain text based generative AI tools according to the Customer definition of prohibited use.

**7.2** Copyleaks does not commit to full enforcement of the restrictions defined by you and as a control tool cannot commit to a complete enforcement of the rules defined by the Customer.

You can delete such correspondence at any time in accordance with our privacy policy. It is your responsibility to obtain your end users consent for the collection and storing of their conversation history.

**7.4** The Generative AI GRC service is designed to improve your control over the use of specific text based generative AI tools. However, in the event that the generative AI tool(s) to which our extension is added undergo substantial changes, we may need to temporarily cease our services in order to make the necessary adjustments to ensure compatibility and optimal functionality. During this adjustment period, the service may not function as intended or may be temporarily unavailable. We will make reasonable efforts to minimize any disruptions and restore the service as soon as possible.

**7.5** Copyleaks shall in no way be liable for any action taken by you or any third party on the basis of a result provided by the Generative AI GRC. You are solely responsible for any inquiry, investigation or other action taken by you on the basis of such result.

In the event that you are required by any applicable law to withhold or deduct taxes for any payment under an Agreement, then the amounts due to Copyleaks shall be increased by the amount necessary so that Copyleaks receives and retains, free from liability for any deduction or withholding, an amount equal to the amount it would have received had you not made any such withholding or deduction.
