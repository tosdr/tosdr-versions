You may purchase as many Credits as you desire. Once the Credits on your Account run out, you will be required to acquire additional Credits to continue enjoying the Services.

**6.1** Copyleaks AI Content Detector is a Copyleaks’ proprietary tool which, at the request of Copyleaks’ users, scans content provided by such user to the AI Content Detector and provides a score between 0 and 100 reflecting the _probability_ that the scanned content is generated by a human or an artificial intelligence (AI) tool.

**6.2** Copyleaks does not provide – and expressly disclaims – any warranty regarding the accuracy of the result provided by the AI Content Detector, which in some cases may incorrectly flag certain content as more likely to be AI-generated.

**6.3** The AI Content Detector is an assessment tool which in no way guarantees whether or not any given content was generated by a human or by AI, and any result provided by the AI Content Detector shall not constitute an endorsement or determination on the part of Copyleaks regarding whether or not the scanned content, or any part of it, was generated by human or by AI.

**6.4** Copyleaks shall in no way be liable for any action taken by you or any third party on the basis of a result provided by the AI Content Detector. You are solely responsible for any inquiry, investigation or other action taken by you on the basis of such result.

**6.5** To the extent the content you provided for a scan by the AI Content Detector is copied from a webpage – you alone shall be fully responsible for compliance with the terms of use of such third party webpage from which the content was copied, and Copyleaks disclaims any and all liability for any breach of such terms of use.

**7.4** The Generative AI GRC service is designed to improve your control over the use of specific text based generative AI tools. However, in the event that the generative AI tool(s) to which our extension is added undergo substantial changes, we may need to temporarily cease our services in order to make the necessary adjustments to ensure compatibility and optimal functionality. During this adjustment period, the service may not function as intended or may be temporarily unavailable. We will make reasonable efforts to minimize any disruptions and restore the service as soon as possible.

**7.5** Copyleaks shall in no way be liable for any action taken by you or any third party on the basis of a result provided by the Generative AI GRC. You are solely responsible for any inquiry, investigation or other action taken by you on the basis of such result.

**9.3 Taxes.** Amounts payable under an Agreement are exclusive of all applicable sales, use, consumption, VAT, GST, and other taxes, duties or governmental charges, except for taxes based upon Copyleaks’ net income. In the event that you are required by any applicable law to withhold or deduct taxes for any payment under an Agreement, then the amounts due to Copyleaks shall be increased by the amount necessary so that Copyleaks receives and retains, free from liability for any deduction or withholding, an amount equal to the amount it would have received had you not made any such withholding or deduction. 

10\. TERM AND TERMINATION

**10.1 Term.** The Agreement shall be effective beginning when you (a) accept these Terms, (b) create an Account, (c) execute an Order Form or (d) access or otherwise use the Services, in each such case whichever occurs first, and shall continue until terminated in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. Each Order Form or subscription term shall automatically renew for successive subscription terms of equal length, unless either party notifies the other party in writing of its intent not to renew the Order Form or the subscription term (as applicable), not less than twenty four (24) hours prior to the expiration of the Account.

**10.2 Termination.** The Agreement or any part of the Services may be suspended or terminated, effective immediately: (a) by Copyleaks, at any time and for any reason, at its sole discretion with or without notice to you; (b) if you materially breach this Agreement; (c) by either party, if it has become impractical or unfeasible for any legal or regulatory reason to use or to provide the Services; or (d) by either party, upon the other party’s liquidation, commencement of dissolution proceedings, disposal of assets, failure to continue business, assignment for the benefit of creditors, or if such other party becomes the subject of a voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy or similar proceeding. Copyleaks shall not be liable to you for damages of any sort resulting solely from terminating this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

**10.3 Modification** and Termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing if Copyleaks reasonably believes that your use of any portion of the Services is likely to be enjoined by reason of a third party’s claim of infringement, violation or misappropriation of its intellectual property rights then Copyleaks may, at its own expense: (i) procure for you the right to continue using the Services; (ii) replace the same with other software, services or other material of equivalent functions and efficiency that is not subject to an action of infringement; (iii) modify the applicable software, support services or other material so that there is no longer any infringement or breach, provided that such modification does not adversely affect the capabilities of the Services as set out herein or.
