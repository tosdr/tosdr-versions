#### Special categories of data

When you make an application for admission to one of our courses of programs, our application form asks you about your racial/ethnic origin. You are not required to give us this information but if you choose to do so we only use it for equal opportunities monitoring and share it with the Department of Education for this purpose. Our legal basis for processing this data is your explicit consent.

All applicants deemed academically eligible by the Walden Admission Committee must initiate drug, background and fingerprint screenings and either clear all screenings within 120 days of the session start date or sign a self-attestation and disclosure indicating their ability to clear all screenings within 120 days of the session start date before the applicant is granted acceptance. Through these checks, we may potentially process health data, criminal convictions and offences data, and your biometric fingerprint information from a third-party background check provider. We will ask you whether we can do this. We only use this data for the purposes of conducting a fraud and security check and clearing your application to the Walden pre-licensure program. We retain this data while you are active in the program and for six years after you leave the program.

In addition, once your application to one of our courses or programs has been accepted, we collect details of any medical conditions you may have, your health insurance information and we may be able to infer information about your racial or ethnic origin from your nationality or from your passport. We only use this information for assisting students with any conditions you may tell us about so that we can arrange any additional support or make any necessary arrangements for you (this is for our legitimate interests in ensuring we provide equal opportunities for all applicants and for carrying out obligations in the field of social protection law.

#### California Privacy Rights

To the extent provided for by law and subject to applicable exemptions, you have the following rights in relation to the personal information about you that we have collected:

* Right to Know: You have the right to request the following information relating to our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months:
* Categories of personal information we have collected about you;

* Right to Non-Discrimination: You have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment for exercising any of the rights described above.

#### To Exercise Your Right to Know or Right to Deletion

California residents can submit requests to know and/or for deletion by emailing us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.waldenu.edu/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or calling us at 1-866-653-5656. California residents may make up to two requests to know within a 12-month period.

#### To Exercise Your Right to Opt-Out

You can opt-out by clicking Do Not Sell My Personal Information and managing your preferences in Cookies Settings

#### Minors Under Age 16

We do not “sell” the personal information of consumers we know to be under 16 years of age.

#### Parents/Guardians

Our Services are not directed to children under the age of 16 and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 16. Any personal data records that may be tied to an applicable individual who cannot provide parental consent will have their record deleted promptly as enforced by the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (15 U.S.C. §§ 6501–6506). Certain data privacy laws may require an individual who is under 16 to provide parental consent. If this applies to you, please defer from utilizing our services until parental consent has been provided. If we become aware that we have unknowingly collected personal information from a child under the age of 16, and do not have parent or guardian consent on file, we will endeavor to delete such personal information from our records. If you believe we are incorrectly processing the personal information of a child under the age of 16, we recommend you contact us as provided in the final section of this policy.

#### Requests Submitted by Authorized Agents

In certain circumstances, you are permitted to use an authorized agent, as that term is defined by the CCPA (“Authorized Agent”), to submit requests on your behalf where you provide sufficient evidence that the requestor is an authorized agent with written permission to act on your behalf and you successfully verify your own identity with us. An Authorized Agent can make a request on a California resident’s behalf by:

1. For requests to know and delete: (1) providing a valid power of attorney under the laws of California; or (2) providing sufficient evidence to show that the California resident has (i) provided the Authorized Agent signed permission to act on their behalf, (ii) verified their own identity directly with us, and (iii) directly confirmed with us that they have provided the Authorized Agent permission to submit the request on their behalf.
2. For requests to opt- out: submitting a signed permission demonstrating that the Authorized Agent has been authorized by the California resident to act on their behalf.

#### Notice of Financial Incentives

From time to time, we may run sweepstakes, contests, or other offers and promotions (collectively, “Programs”) that may be deemed “financial incentives” in relation to our collection of personal information under the CCPA. Please refer to the terms and conditions of each Program for additional information about the Program, including how eligible consumers can opt-in or opt-out of the Program at any time. To enter a Program, you may be required to provide us or a service provider acting on our behalf with certain personal information, such as identifiers including your name and contact information (“Rewards Data”). If you submit your entry in accordance with the applicable Program’s rules, you may be entered into the Program and will get a chance to win a prize or receive another benefit from us. The value of Rewards Data is related to \[the value of your information and the costs associated with offering the Program.

#### California “Shine the Light”

In addition to the rights described above, California’s “Shine the Light” law permits California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure, if any, of certain categories of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year. To make such a request, please send an email to [\[email protected\]](https://www.waldenu.edu/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). This request may be made no more than once per calendar year.

Ombuds Services
---------------

Ombuds Services at Walden University serves as an objective resource for the university, advocating for fairness. Ombuds Services reviews decisions made by the university for fairness and ensures policies and processes have been followed. In addition, Ombuds Services is available for the mediation of student issues when all university processes have been exhausted. The goal is to aid in the timely and impartial resolution of problems in a non-adversarial, non-litigious manner.

Ombuds Services observes the confidentiality of any and all parties involved in complaints and other concerns brought to its representatives to the extent possible, insofar as it does not interfere with the institution’s legal obligation or ability to investigate issues, or to take corrective action when it is found that misconduct has occurred. Ombuds Services representatives will speak to relevant university faculty and staff on a need-to-know basis in order to address any such concerns and may also refer students to the department or university representative best suited to resolve the concern.

Results of any fairness review or mediation are final and not subject to appeal.

No formal registration is required; ownership is immediate. The author can transfer ownership of a copyright to another so the copyright owner may not be the original author of the work. Creative works include songs, stories, poems, paintings, photographs, or other works that contain a creative element. Ownership of the copyright gives the owner exclusive rights in that work such as the right to display, reproduce, transmit, create derivative works from, publicly perform, distribute, and license the creative work. This means that, absent permission from the creator, you may not take the creative work owned by another and exercise these rights. Such a violation is called “infringement” of the owner’s copyright. For example, if you legally purchase a music CD, you may not create copies of the music on that CD and distribute those copies to others over the Internet. Helping others to violate the owner’s copyright by making it easy for them to distribute such materials may also be illegal.

#### **Actions and Penalties for Copyright Infringement**

Under U.S. Copyright Law, a copyright owner who has been the victim of copyright infringement is entitled to recover actual damages and profits from the infringer or statutory damages of up to $30,000 per violation. The copyright owner has the right to permanently enjoin the infringer from further infringing activities.

Walden University, recognizing and respecting intellectual property rights, requires its employees, instructors, students, and other community members to use copyrighted materials in a lawful manner. Walden University’s Code of Conduct, as found in the Walden University’s Student Handbook ([http://catalog.waldenu.edu/content.php?catoid=155&navoid=51011](http://catalog.waldenu.edu/content.php?catoid=155&navoid=51011)), presents Walden University’s copyright policy. Copyright infringement can result in applicants being rejected for admission and enrolled students and employees being dismissed.

Additionally, Walden University maintains a vigorous program of accepting and responding to Digital Millennium Copyright ACT (DMCA) notices, which are immediately escalated to Walden University’s legal team for investigation and action. If the materials in question are determined by the legal department to be infringing, the Information Technology department is notified and action is taken that can include either the removal of the infringing materials from Walden University’s network or the blocking of the infringer’s network access. The infringer is notified and reminded of Walden University’s Code of Conduct. Repeated violations can result in dismissal.
