End-User Terms of Service
=========================

Updated: Oct 10th, 2022

The Instabug End-User Terms of Service (these “Terms of Service”) set forth the terms and conditions upon which Instabug, Inc. (“Instabug”) offers you, our end-users (each, an “End-User”), access to any applicable Instabug Software Development Kit, product, marketplace, application, tool, or service (collectively, the “Service”) solely for the purpose and to the extent authorized by Instabug and, if applicable, the Instabug partner or customer on whose behalf you are accessing the Service (“Entity”) and, if applicable, solely in accordance with, and subject to, the then-effective written agreement(s) between Instabug and Entity (collectively, the “Entity Agreement”). Instabug and End-User are each sometimes individually referred to herein as a “Party” and are sometimes collectively referred to herein as the “Parties.” By clicking “Sign up” or “I agree” or otherwise indicating your assent or by accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these Terms of Service, do not access or use the Service. This is a legally enforceable contract. From time to time, Instabug may modify these Terms of Service, effective upon notice to you. Your continued access to or use of the Service constitutes your acceptance of any such revisions.  No other amendment, modification or supplement of any provision of these Terms of Service will be valid or effective unless made in writing and signed by both Parties. Neither any course of conduct between Instabug and you (or, as applicable, Entity) nor any trade practices shall act to modify these Terms of Service. Instabug’s Privacy Policy (as Instabug may amend from time to time, the “Privacy Policy”) is incorporated into and made part of these Terms of Service, and you hereby agree to the terms of the Privacy Policy.

### ‍  
1\. LICENSE

**1.1 Limited License to Use the Service.** Subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms of Service, Instabug hereby grants to End-User a limited, personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable license, during the term of these Terms of Service, to access and use the Service solely for the purpose and to the extent authorized by Instabug (and, if applicable, Entity) and, if applicable, solely in accordance with the Entity Agreement. Except for the limited license rights expressly granted under these Terms of Service, no licenses or rights are granted by Instabug to End-User hereunder, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All such other licenses and rights are reserved by Instabug.

**1.2 License Restrictions.** End-User shall not, and shall not permit any third party to access or use the Service except as expressly authorized by these Terms of Service (and, if applicable, the Entity Agreement). For purposes of clarity and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as expressly authorized by these Terms of Service (and, if applicable, the Entity Agreement), End-User shall not (a) copy, modify, or create derivative works or improvements of the Service; (b) rent, lease, lend, sell, sublicense, assign, distribute, publish, transfer, or otherwise make available the Service to any third party, including on or in connection with the internet or any time-sharing, service bureau, software as a service, cloud, or other technology or service; (c) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, decode, adapt, or otherwise attempt to derive or gain access to the source code of the Service, in whole or in part; (d) bypass or breach any security device or protection used by the Service or access or use the Service other than through his or her own then valid access credentials; (e) input, upload, transmit, or otherwise provide to or through the Service or Instabug’s systems, any information or materials that are unlawful or injurious, or contain, transmit, or activate any software, device or other subject matter (including any service, code, file or program) that is designed to (i) prevent, impair or otherwise adversely affect the operation of any computer service, hardware or network, any telecommunications service, equipment or network or any other service or device, (ii) prevent, impair or otherwise adversely affect access to or the operation of any program or data, including the reliability of any program or data (whether by re-arranging, altering or erasing the program or data in whole or part or otherwise), or (iii) adversely affect the user experience, including worms, Trojan horses, viruses and other similar devices; or (f) damage, destroy, disrupt, disable, impair, interfere with, or otherwise impede or harm in any manner the Service, Instabug’s systems, or Instabug’s provision of any products or services to any third party. End-User shall treat the content, features, functionality, underlying algorithms, ideas and data, structure and other proprietary aspects of the Service as confidential information and at all times strictly maintain the confidentiality of the foregoing. End User shall not access or use the Services or Instabug Materials in, or in association with, the transmission of "Highly Sensitive Personal Information" defined as an (i) individual's government-issued identification number (including Social Security number, driver's license number, or state-issued identification number); (ii) confidential financial information, financial account number, credit card number, debit card number, or credit report information, with or without any required security code, access code, personal identification number, or password that would permit access to an individual's financial account; or (iii) biometric, genetic, health, medical, or medical insurance data. In addition, End-User shall, if applicable, comply with Entity’s confidentiality obligations under the Entity Agreement. Certain fees may apply, and Instabug reserves the right, at any time, to charge or modify fees in connection with the Service. End-User’s access to and use of the Service is conditional on full, timely payment of all applicable fees.

**1.3 Third Party Providers.** Instabug may use certain third-party providers to gather End-User related data and other information from, and transmit such information to, financial institutions for accounting purposes or other purposes related to the Instabug SDK or Services. End-User hereby appoints such third-party providers as End-User’s authorized agents to access and transmit such information for such purposes and to perform such services. End-User will be responsible for providing reasonably requested (or customary) pertinent information to or for such third-party providers, and taking reasonably requested (or customary) actions, in connection with such services.

**1.4 Third Party Materials.** From time to time, Instabug may make available (through the Service or a related Instabug service) certain third-party services, documents, forms, data, content, products, applications, utilities, software, hardware, systems, networks, connections, and other materials (collectively, “Third Party Materials”). Any acquisition by End-User of any Third Party Materials, and any exchange of data between End-User and any third party or Third Party Materials, is solely between End-User (or, if applicable, Entity) and the applicable non-Instabug provider. Instabug shall not be liable or responsible for any third party or any Third Party Materials, or for any loss, damage, injury, malfunction, interruption or claim arising therefrom or related thereto. Instabug does not warrant or support Third Party Materials or their interoperation with the Service, whether or not they are designated by Instabug as “certified,” “approved,” or any similar status. Instabug is not responsible for any disclosure, modification, or deletion of data resulting from access by any non-Instabug provider. End-User shall use any such Third Party Materials solely in accordance with the independent rights that End-User (or, if applicable, Entity) has directly secured. If any terms associated with any Third Party Materials are required by the applicable non-Instabug provider and are posted in the Service (or otherwise made available to End-User), End-User shall carefully review and agree to any such terms before accessing or using such Third Party Materials. End-User hereby grants Instabug permission to allow the non-Instabug provider to access End-User Data (as defined below) as relevant for the interoperation of Third Party Materials.

### ‍  
2\. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

**2.1 Allocation of Rights.** Instabug, Third Party Providers, and their respective licensors retain all intellectual property rights in and to the Service and any Third Party Materials (including all related copyrights, patents, service marks, trademarks and other intellectual property rights), including but not limited to any and all updates, enhancements, customizations, revisions, modifications, future releases and any other changes thereto, and all related information, materials and documentation. Except for any rights specifically granted to End-User under these Terms of Service, End-User hereby assigns to Instabug all other intellectual property rights it may now or hereafter possess in the Service, any related documentation, or any suggestions or other feedback related to the Service or Instabug’s business that End-User may provide, and all derivative works and improvements thereof, and agrees to execute all documents, and take all actions, that may be reasonably necessary to confirm such rights. End-User also agrees to retain all proprietary marks, legends and patent and copyright notices that appear on the Service or any related documentation delivered or made available to End-User by Instabug. End-User shall not engage in or authorize any act or omission that would violate, contradict, challenge or limit Instabug’s intellectual property rights. Nothing contained in these Terms of Service will restrict Instabug from using any feedback, skills, knowledge, concepts, methodologies, functionalities, processes, techniques or information in intangible form that is gained through the performance of these Terms of Service or access to End-User’s information or materials (collectively, “Residuals”). All Residuals shall remain the property of Instabug.

**2.2 End-User Data.** “End-User Data” means, collectively, any data, information, access, credentials, instructions, materials or other content that is uploaded or otherwise provided to Instabug through, or in connection with, the Service by or on behalf of End-User or under End-User’s account. End-User represents, warrants, and covenants to Instabug that (a) the End-User Data shall at all times be current, accurate, true, lawful, lawfully obtained and complete, shall not infringe or violate any third party rights, and shall, as applicable, be updated by End-User as soon as practicable; (b) End-User has provided all notices and obtained all rights, consents and authority necessary to (i) provide to Instabug, and for Instabug to use as permitted under these Terms of Service, the End-User Data, and (ii) obtain or access any data, materials or other content that End-User requests or orders through or in connection with the Service; and (c) if End-User is working on behalf of an Entity, End-User’s data usage, sharing, and processing activities otherwise comply with the Instabug Customer Agreement entered into by the Entity you represent, if applicable. Instabug reserves the right, but not the obligation, to block, remove or limit access to any End-User Data or any other content (including communications) that Instabug determines, in its sole discretion, to be unacceptable or inappropriate. End-User Data does not contain: (i) protected health information or information subject to HIPAA compliance or other relevant law or regulation; (ii) information subject to SOX, GLBA requirements or other relevant law or regulation; (iii) information that falls within the definition of “special categories of data” under data protection laws, unless explicitly and affirmatively consented to by End-User. End-User hereby grants to Instabug the non-exclusive right to use End-User Data solely in accordance with the Privacy Policy and these Terms of Service, as reasonably necessary for Instabug to offer, provide and improve the Service. In addition, End-User hereby grants to Instabug a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive right to use, copy, store, modify, process and disclose any data collected in connection with the Service on a de-identified basis for any lawful purpose related to the Service or Instabug’s business in accordance with the Privacy Policy.  

### ‍  
3\. DISCLAIMERS; LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY.

INSTABUG MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS AS TO THE ACCURACY OR APPROPRIATENESS OF ANY CONTENT PROCESSED OR AVAILABLE IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICE.  ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF OR CONCERNING ANY THIRD PARTY MATERIALS IS STRICTLY BETWEEN END-USER (OR, IF APPLICABLE, ENTITY) AND THE APPLICABLE THIRD PARTY PROVIDER.

Instabug does not endorse any Third Party Provider or Third Party Materials. Instabug shall not be liable or responsible for any acts or omissions of any Third Party Provider or for any Third Party Materials, or for any loss, damage, injury, malfunction, interruption or claim arising therefrom or related thereto. Instabug reserves the right, at any time, to modify, suspend or discontinue the Service, and End-User agrees that Instabug shall not be liable for any such action and that the Service may not include any particular functionality or features (regardless of any Instabug statements or documentation).

**3.2 Limitations of Liability.** IN NO EVENT SHALL INSTABUG, ITS AFFILIATES OR ANY OF ITS OR THEIR RESPECTIVE LICENSORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, OR SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OF SERVICE OR ITS SUBJECT MATTER FOR LOST PROFITS OR BUSINESS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOSS OF DATA, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, COST OF REPLACEMENT OR SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR FOR ANY EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, REGARDLESS OF THE BASIS OR THEORY OF ANY CLAIM AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER INSTABUG IS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SUCH DAMAGES OR LOSSES. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF INSTABUG, ITS AFFILIATES OR ANY OF ITS OR THEIR RESPECTIVE LICENSORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, OR SUPPLIERS UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OF SERVICE OR ITS SUBJECT MATTER, REGARDLESS OF THE BASIS OR THEORY OF ANY CLAIM, EXCEED $500.

**3.3 Essential Part of the Bargain.** The Parties acknowledge that the disclaimers and limitations set forth in this Section are an essential element of these Terms of Service between the Parties and the Parties would not have entered into these Terms of Service without such disclaimers and limitations.

### ‍  
4\. INDEMNIFICATION; UNAUTHORIZED USE

**4.1 Indemnification.** End-User shall indemnify and hold harmless Instabug and its subcontractors and affiliates, and each of its and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, successors, and assigns (each, a “Instabug Indemnitee”) from any and all liabilities, losses, damages, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) incurred by such Instabug Indemnitee in connection with any claims, proceedings or causes of action that arise out of or result from, or are alleged to arise out of or result from, any (a) End-User Data, including any access, use, collection, generation, handling, processing, copying, storage, hosting, transmission, disclosure, transfer, disposal or destruction of End-User Data by or on behalf of Instabug as permitted under these Terms of Service; (b) access to or use of the Service, any other user’s content or any Third Party Materials by End-User or under End-User’s account in violation of any applicable law, regulation or third party terms, policies or agreements; (c) breach by End-User of these Terms of Service; or (d) negligence, gross negligence, or more culpable act or omission (including recklessness or willful misconduct) by or on behalf of End-User in connection with these Terms of Service.

**5.3 Effect of Termination.** Upon the expiration or termination of these Terms of Service, all license rights of End-User under these Terms of Service shall automatically and immediately cease and End-User shall promptly cease all use of the Service.

### ‍  
6\. GENERAL

**6.1 Trade Compliance.** End-User agrees and understands that the Instabug SDK and Services are subject to U.S. export controls and sanctions laws and regulations, and the export controls and sanctions laws of any other applicable jurisdiction. End-User agrees and acknowledges that End-User will not access, register for, or otherwise use the Instabug SDK or Services in a country or region subject to U.S. comprehensive trade sanctions (including Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, the Crimea region, the Donetsk People’s Republic (“DNR”), and Luhansk People’s Republic (“LNR”) of Ukraine) (“Embargoed Countries”), nor will End-User use the Instabug SDK or Services in any manner prohibited by U.S. export controls or sanctions laws and regulations. End-User represents that it is not (i) a resident or national of any Embargoed Countries, or an entity organized under the laws of any Embargoed Countries; (ii) designated on any list of prohibited or restricted parties maintained by the U.S. Government or other applicable jurisdictions, including but not limited to the Office of Foreign Assets Control’s (OFAC) Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List; other OFAC Lists or Directives; the Entity, Denied Persons, Military End User, and Unverified Lists maintained by the U.S. Department of Commerce; and the UN Security Council Consolidated List; or (iii) 50% or more owned by any party designated on any of the above lists. End-User agrees and understands that Instabug may terminate Services and this Agreement immediately without notice or liability to comply with applicable export controls and sanctions laws and regulations, in its sole and absolute discretion.

**6.2 Independent Contractors.** In making and performing these Terms of Service, the Parties are acting and shall act as independent contractors.  Neither Party is, nor will be deemed to be, an agent, legal representative, joint venturer or partner of the other Party for any purpose.

**6.3 Force Majeure.** Instabug shall not be liable to End-User for failure or delay in performance under these Terms of Service if such failure or delay is caused by riot, flood, earthquake, natural disaster, electronic virus, electronic attack of infiltration, internet disturbance, government act or any other cause beyond Instabug’s control.

**6.4 Governing Law; Dispute Resolution.** These Terms of Service shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of California, excluding its conflict of laws provisions.  In the event of any controversy or claim arising out of or in connection with these Terms of Service, or a breach thereof, the Parties agree to use the following procedure.

The Parties consent and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue over any claim that may arise out of or in connection with these Terms of Service in the courts located in San Francisco County, California, provided that either Party may, without limiting any of its rights or remedies (whether under these Terms of Service, at law, in equity or otherwise), seek injunctive relief and other equitable remedies at any time in any court of competent jurisdiction for any actual or threatened breach of these Terms of Service relating to intellectual property rights or confidentiality obligations. Each Party acknowledges that its breach of any of the provisions related to its confidentiality obligations or the other Party’s intellectual property rights may cause irreparable injury to the other Party for which monetary damages are not an adequate remedy.

**6.5 Assignment.** End-User may not assign any of its rights or privileges, or delegate any of its duties or obligations hereunder, to any third party without the prior written consent of Instabug. Any purported assignment in contravention of this Section shall be null and void.  Subject to the foregoing, these Terms of Service shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns.
