=========================

Updated: Oct 10th, 2022

The Instabug End-User Terms of Service (these ‚ÄúTerms of Service‚Äù) set forth the terms and conditions upon which Instabug, Inc. (‚ÄúInstabug‚Äù) offers you, our end-users (each, an ‚ÄúEnd-User‚Äù), access to any applicable Instabug Software Development Kit, product, marketplace, application, tool, or service (collectively, the ‚ÄúService‚Äù) solely for the purpose and to the extent authorized by Instabug and, if applicable, the Instabug partner or customer on whose behalf you are accessing the Service (‚ÄúEntity‚Äù) and, if applicable, solely in accordance with, and subject to, the then-effective written agreement(s) between Instabug and Entity (collectively, the ‚ÄúEntity Agreement‚Äù).¬†Instabug and End-User are each sometimes individually referred to herein as a ‚ÄúParty‚Äù and are sometimes collectively referred to herein as the ‚ÄúParties.‚Äù¬†By clicking ‚ÄúSign up‚Äù or ‚ÄúI agree‚Äù or otherwise indicating your assent or by accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these Terms of Service, do not access or use the Service. This is a legally enforceable contract. From time to time, Instabug may modify these Terms of Service, effective upon notice to you. Your continued access to or use of the Service constitutes your acceptance of any such revisions. ¬†No other amendment, modification or supplement of any provision of these Terms of Service will be valid or effective unless made in writing and signed by both Parties. Neither any course of conduct between Instabug and you (or, as applicable, Entity) nor any trade practices shall act to modify these Terms of Service. Instabug‚Äôs Privacy Policy (as Instabug may amend from time to time, the ‚ÄúPrivacy Policy‚Äù) is incorporated into and made part of these Terms of Service, and you hereby agree to the terms of the Privacy Policy.

Instabug shall not be liable or responsible for any third party or any Third Party Materials, or for any loss, damage, injury, malfunction, interruption or claim arising therefrom or related thereto. Instabug does not warrant or support Third Party Materials or their interoperation with the Service, whether or not they are designated by Instabug as ‚Äúcertified,‚Äù ‚Äúapproved,‚Äù or any similar status. Instabug is not responsible for any disclosure, modification, or deletion of data resulting from access by any non-Instabug provider.¬†End-User shall use any such Third Party Materials solely in accordance with the independent rights that End-User (or, if applicable, Entity) has directly secured. If any terms associated with any Third Party Materials are required by the applicable non-Instabug provider and are posted in the Service (or otherwise made available to End-User), End-User shall carefully review and agree to any such terms before accessing or using such Third Party Materials. End-User hereby grants Instabug permission to allow the non-Instabug provider to access End-User Data (as defined below) as relevant for the interoperation of Third Party Materials.
