### Introduction

By using the www.instabug.com website (‚Äú**Site**‚Äù) and any related services and/or features (together with the Site, the "**Service**") you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy. If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy or our use of your data, please contact us at privacy@instabug.com

### Scope

This Privacy Policy covers Instabug's treatment of personal data ("Personal Data") that Instabug gathers when you access or otherwise use the Service. It explains what data we collect, why we collect the data, how it is used and your rights and choices. While providing our Service, we may collect information about our customers‚Äô end-users at the direction of and on behalf of our customers. Our use of this information is governed by our agreement with the applicable customer and the customer‚Äôs privacy policies. We do not control and are not responsible for the privacy policies or privacy practices of our customers or any other third parties. We encourage you to review any such policies or practices that apply to you carefully.

### 1- What Personal Data does Instabug collect?

**Information That You Provide To Us.** Instabug collects the information you voluntarily submit to the Service as follows:

* **Account Creation** - We may collect information when you create your account, including your name, email address, mailing address and phone number,
* **Payment Information** - We may collect information and details associated with your purchases, including payment-related information collected by our third-party payment processors on our behalf. We do not directly collect or store any payment card information, but may receive billing address or other non-sensitive information associated with your payment card from our third-party processors.
* **Your Communications With Us** - We collect Personal Data that is entered on our Site or is sent to us electronically when you request customer or technical support, request a product demo, register for a webinar or other event, complete any ‚Äúfree text‚Äù boxes in our forms (for example, support request or survey submission), apply for a job, or otherwise communicate with us.
* **User-Generated Content** - We may collect Personal Data voluntarily disclosed by you on our forums, blogs and our other areas of the Service to which you can post information and materials.

**Information Received From Third-Party Services.** If you connect to the Service using credentials from a third-party service or sign-in services such as OAuth (for example, login with a GitHub or Google account), these services will authenticate a user‚Äôs identity and provide the user with the option to share certain Personal Data, such as name and email address(es), with us.

**Automatically Collected Data.** Whenever you interact with the Service, we automatically receive and store certain types of information including information that your browser automatically sends. Such information may include your IP address (which is briefly collected to identify the country you are connecting from at the time you visit the Site, after which the IP address is deleted), domain server, and type of Internet browser.

In addition, we may collect service-related, diagnostic, and performance information. This includes high level information about your activity (such as diagnostic, crash, and performance logs and reports).

We may also collect general device information when you access or use the Service. This may include your operating system, device connectivity, and other general diagnostic data. We do not collect device IDs or other specific device identification data.

**Cookies and Similar Technologies.** Like many online services, we may use tracking technologies, such as cookies and similar technologies (e.g. web beacons and pixels) in order to automatically collect and store this information. Specifically, we may use the following technologies:

* **Cookies**, which are text files that websites store on a visitor‚Äôs device to uniquely identify the visitor‚Äôs browser or to store information or settings in the browser for the purpose of helping you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, enabling functionality, helping us understand user activity and patterns, and facilitating analytics and online advertising.
* **Local storage technologies**, like HTML5 and Flash, that provide cookie-equivalent functionality but can store larger amounts of data, including on your device outside of your browser in connection with specific applications.
* **Web beacons**, also known as pixel tags or clear GIFs, which are used to demonstrate that a webpage or email address was accessed or opened, or that certain content was viewed or clicked.

**Marketing**. We may use your contact details to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you, upcoming events or other promotions. If we do so, each marketing communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to "opt-out" of receiving future marketing communications. Note however that as a user of our services you cannot opt-out of some administrative communications that are reasonably necessary to the Service, such as billing or service notifications. Moreover, if at any time you wish not to receive any future marketing communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below.

Where required by applicable law (for example, if you are an individual in the EU), we will only send you marketing information by email if you consent to us doing so at the time you provide us with your Personal Data. When you provide us with your consent to be contacted for marketing purposes, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time by following the instructions to ‚Äúopt-out‚Äù of receiving marketing communication in each marketing email we send you or by contacting us as indicated below.

**With your consent.** In some cases, we may specifically ask for your consent to collect, use or share your personal information, such as when required by law.

**To create anonymous, aggregated or de-identified data.** We may create anonymous, aggregated or de-identified data from your personal information and other individuals whose personal information we collect. We make personal information into anonymous, aggregated or de-identified data by removing information that makes the data identifiable to you. We may use this anonymous, aggregated or de-identified data and share it with third parties for our lawful business purposes, including to analyze and improve the Services and promote our business.

### 3\. Will Instabug share any of the personal data it receives?

Instabug only shares Personal Data with other companies or individuals outside of Instabug in the following circumstances:

When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific functions. Pursuant to our instructions, these parties may access, process or store Personal Data in the course of performing their duties to us and solely in order to perform the services we have hired them to provide. Unless described in this Policy, we do not share, sell, rent or trade any of your information with third parties for their promotional purposes.

\- **Protection of Instabug and Others**: We may release Personal Data when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with the law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Instabug, our employees, our users, or others.

\- **Business Transfers**: If Instabug or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Instabug goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, Personal Data about our customers would be one of the assets that are transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and that any acquirer of Instabug may continue to use your Personal Data as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

If you have elected to receive marketing communications from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences until you opt-out of receiving these communications and in accordance with our policies.

To determine the appropriate retention period for your Personal Data, we will consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Data, the purposes for which we use your Personal Data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
