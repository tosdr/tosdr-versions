Please read the terms and conditions of use (the “**Terms of Use**”) set forth below carefully as they contain the legal terms that govern your use of any web site web page, services and products operated or provided by Waterloo Maple Inc. (“**Maplesoft**”, “**we**” or “**us**”) (collectively referred to as, the “**Services**”). By accessing, viewing, downloading or otherwise using the Services you agree to be bound by the Terms of Use and any other policies or agreements made part of the Terms of Use by reference, including without limitation the Privacy Policy, as well as any new, different or additional terms, conditions or policies which Maplesoft may establish from time to time.  
  
**If you do not agree to the Terms of Use, then you must discontinue accessing the Services. Maplesoft may modify the Terms of Use at any time, without notice and in its sole discretion. Your continued use of any of the Services after any modification will constitute your acknowledgement and acceptance of the Terms of Use as modified. Please consult the Terms of Use regularly.**  
  
**Registered Member Passwords / Account Access:** In accordance with the Terms of Use, certain Services may require that you register as a member of the Services (a “**Registered Member**”) and to provide information about yourself (such as identification or contact details) as part of the registration process for a Service, or as part of your continued use of the Services. You agree that any registration information you give to Maplesoft will always be accurate, correct and up to date.  
  
If you are a Registered Member, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account, and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your password or account with or without your knowledge. If you suspect that someone else knows your password, you must change it immediately and you must notify Maplesoft of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security by contacting Maplesoft either by telephone (519-747-2373) or by e-mail ([info@maplesoft.com](mailto:info@maplesoft.com)) as soon as possible and follow any instructions given to you. Maplesoft cannot and will not be liable, directly or indirectly, for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this section.  
  
The Services are intended for a general audience, and children under the age of thirteen are not permitted to register as a Registered Member. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you have the right, authority, and capacity to enter into the Terms of Use and to abide by all of the terms and conditions set forth herein. Your Maplesoft account may be deleted and your membership may be terminated without warning, if we believe that you are under thirteen years of age.  
  
You agree that Maplesoft shall not be liable to you nor any third party for any termination of your account or access to the Services.

The Privacy Policy provides your rights and our responsibilities with regard to your personal information. We will not use your information in any way inconsistent with the purposes and limitations provided in the Privacy Policy.  
  
**Products and Services:** All products and services referred to through the Services are subject to the terms of the applicable Separate Agreement (as defined below) governing their use.

For example, the use of any software that is made available to download from any of the Services ("**Software**") is governed by the terms of the end user license agreement, if any, which accompanies or is included with the Software ("**License Agreement**"). You may not install any Software that is accompanied by or includes a License Agreement unless you first have agreed to the License Agreement terms. FURTHER REPRODUCTION OR REDISTRIBUTION OF ANY SOFTWARE IS EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED, UNLESS SUCH REPRODUCTION OR REDISTRIBUTION IS EXPRESSLY PERMITTED BY THE LICENSE AGREEMENT ACCOMPANYING OR INCLUDED WITH SUCH SOFTWARE.  
  
**Our License Grant to You:** Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Terms of Use, including, without limitation, those terms and conditions set out in any applicable Separate Agreement, Maplesoft grants you a non-exclusive, royalty-free, revocable, non-transferable, limited right to access and use the Services in accordance with the Terms of Use and any applicable agreement governing the use of specific Services.
