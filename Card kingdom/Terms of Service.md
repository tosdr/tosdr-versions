In the event of a dispute regarding the delivery of your products, you must contact customer service.

Card Kingdom is not liable for any loss or damages due to late or non-delivery of your purchased items.

**Products and Pricing**

Card Kingdom tries to be as accurate as possible in all aspects of card pricing and product availability. However, Card Kingdom does not guarantee that product listings, prices, descriptions, available quantities, shipping times or release dates are accurate, complete, reliable, current or error-free.

Unless otherwise noted, the price displayed for products on Card Kingdom represents the current price for that product, not including any shipping charges, taxes or processing fees that may be required. We cannot confirm the availability or price of an item until you proceed to Checkout. At that point, the shopping cart will alert you if we are unable to ship a card. You will have the opportunity to select different cards, quantities or conditions to remedy this before Checkout is completed. Despite our best efforts, sometimes an item in our catalog may not be available, the offer may have been misstated, or an item may be mispriced. For any of these reasons, we may cancel your order, or we may contact you for instructions on the order.

**Order Confirmation**

Our order confirmation to you does not signify our acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell. At any time after receipt of your order, we may accept, decline, or place quantity or other limits on your order for any reason. We may impose these limits on a per-person, per-household, per-order, or any other basis. If we reject, limit, or otherwise modify your order, we will attempt to notify you using the e-mail address you provide to us. If we cancel an order or part of an order that we've already charged you for, we'll refund you the full amount of the canceled portion of the order. Card Kingdom reserves the right to refuse any order placed on the Site.

**Paying for Your Order**

Generally, Card Kingdom will charge your card or other applicable payment method for an item when we ship the item to you. However, we may preauthorize your order amount with your credit or debit card issuer at the time you place the order, which may have an effect on your available credit line. When you pre-order with a debit card, we will debit your card when you place the pre-order. If you use Paypal as your payment method, your PayPal account will be charged as soon as you submit your order.

Certain factors may trigger an authorization challenge from your bank. If you pass the authorization challenge, your order will be processed as normal.

All transactions on the SITE are completed in U.S. dollars (USD.)

**Selling to Card Kingdom**

Card Kingdom may choose to purchase items from sellers who complete a sell order request.

Our Sell Order Confirmation to you does not signify our acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to purchase. Card Kingdom may accept, decline, or place quantity or other limits on your order at any time after checkout and for any reason. We may impose these limits on a per-person, per-household, per-order, or any other basis. If we reject, limit, or otherwise modify your order, we will attempt to notify you using the e-mail address you provide to us. Card Kingdom reserves the right to refuse any order placed on the Site.

Upon the physical receipt of an order, all items on that order will be assessed to determine their condition according to Card Kingdom's published grading guide. Card Kingdom exercises sole discretion over the final condition assigned to any item. Card Kingdom will then update the offered purchase price of each item on the invoice to reflect the condition.

[More information about our conditions guidelines and the potential reduction in purchase price can be found here.](https://www.cardkingdom.com/purchasing/how_to_sell)

Card Kingdom will not contact you with the grading results before completing your order. If you would prefer to be notified with your card grades before we finalize and pay out the order, please include a note on the customer comments of your Sell Order with this request and we will make a good faith attempt to email you with the grades and allow you an opportunity to request cards back however we are unable to guarantee this communication. Once an order is finalized the cards are incorporated into our live inventory and we are unable to reverse any part of the sale.

Card Kingdom is unable to pay for cards received but not listed on the invoice or cards not received by our Grading Department, even if they appear on the invoice. If a card is not included in your sell order shipment for any reason, we cannot offer payment.  Sellers are responsible for the delivery of their items to Card Kingdom's fulfillment location. Card Kingdom is not responsible for items that are not delivered and not liable for any loss or damages due to late or non-delivery of your items.

**Returns, Refunds, and Title**

All sales are final unless otherwise specified. Card Kingdom does not provide credit, refunds, or exchanges except in cases where the items received are damaged, defective, or not as described on the site. To be considered for credit, refund, or an exchange, you must contact us within 48 hours of receiving your order. Requests will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

Card Kingdom does not take title to returned items until the item arrives at our fulfillment center. At our discretion, a refund may be issued without requiring a return. In this situation, Card Kingdom does not take title to the refunded item.
