#### Terms & Conditions of Affiliate Program – FastestVPN

If you have any queries concerning these terms, you can contact us through [\[email protected\]](https://fastestvpn.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)

Any individual/company can earn referral commission by referring customers to FastestVPN through our affiliate program. Commissions through referrals will be generated when a ‘new’ customer, referred by an affiliate, uses our services by purchasing a package plan (I.e. a “subscription”). When an invoice is noted as paid and approved, that is when the referral commission is counted as valid.

#### Refund/Chargeback Policy

A customer has the option to submit a refund request within 31-days of purchasing the subscription. If he fails to submit a refund request within 31-days, he may still be given a refund provided that he submits a valid reason (FastestVPN holds rights to decision). In case of a refund/chargeback, the affiliate will not be entitled to the commission for that particular sale. If we have already paid the relevant commission to an Affiliate, we shall deduct that amount from our next payment.

Where the rate of chargeback(s), refunds or cancellations on your account is unusually high or we suspect your affiliate account is being used for fraudulent activity, we reserve the right to place restrictions on the your account, including but not limited to, suspending your account and retaining all sums within the account as well as commencing a full investigation. You give us your authorization to inform the appropriate authorities or third parties of any fraud or suspected fraud and only once we are satisfied that the matter is resolved, shall we remove any restrictions on your account.

#### Payout

The minimum affiliate payout is $100 for Paypal and $500 for bank transfers or as the contract specifies, if any. If minimum payout amount is reached before month end, the affiliate is eligible to receive the commission between 15th and 20th of the following month. Bank transfer payments will incur a fee of $25. In addition, your bank (or intermediary bank) may impose additional charges that must be paid by the Affiliate. PayPal payments will incur a fee of 2% of the total commission payable.

Before making any payments, we reserve the right to review your account to ensure compliance with these terms. We shall have no obligation to make payments to affiliates who are in breach of these terms. Where it is not clear to us how you are referring customers to our service, we will require you to provide to us such information before we make a payment to you.
