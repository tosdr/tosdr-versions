This Privacy Policy (“**Policy**”) describes the manner in which Cloudary Holdings Limited, operating the Webnovel service (“**Webnovel**”, “**we**,” or “**us**”) and our websites www.webnovel.com (the “Site”), as well as all related websites, networks, applications, and other services provided by us and on which a link to this Policy is displayed (collectively, together with the Site, our “**Service**”) collect, use, disclose and otherwise process Personal Information. “Personal Information” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual. This Policy, which is incorporated into and is subject to the Webnovel Terms of Service, describes the information that we gather from you on the Service, how we use and disclose such information, and the steps we take to protect such information.

**1\. Personal Information We Collect:**

We may collect Personal Information about you from various sources described below. Where applicable, we indicate whether and why you must provide us with your Personal Information, as well as the consequences of failing to do so. If you do not provide Personal Information when requested, you may not be able to benefit from our Service if that information is necessary to provide you with it or if we are legally required to collect it.

* **User-provided Information.** When you use the Service, we ask you to provide certain Personal Information about you, including your name, gender, email address, mailing address, phone number, credit card or other billing information, your date of birth, geographic area, or preferences and we may link this information with other information about you. For example, we may ask you to provide us with Personal Information when you register for an account, use the Service, or make a purchase on the Service.
    
    We may also collect any other Personal Information that you choose to provide to us. For example, if you decide to contact us with a request, we will process the content of your message, the date and time of your message, our response and any other Personal Information you provide in that context. If you contact us to apply for a job with Webnovel, we will process your job application, including your curriculum vitae and other Personal Information you submit to us in that context.
    

* **Automatically Collected Information.** When you use the Service, we may send one or more cookies – small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your device. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service. We may also automatically record certain information from your device by using various types of technology, including “clear gifs" or “web beacons.” In this context, we may collect certain information about you, such as your IP address or other device address or ID, web browser and/or device type, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after you use the Service, the pages or other content you view or otherwise interact with on the Service, and the dates and times that you visit, access, or use the Service. We also may use these technologies to collect information regarding your interaction with email messages, such as whether you opened, clicked on, or forwarded a message. This information is gathered from all users, and may be connected with other information about you.
    
    Please review your web browser “Help" file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. Please note that if you delete, or choose not to accept, cookies from the Service, you may not be able to utilize the features of the Service to their fullest potential. We may use third party cookies on our Service as well. For instance, we use Google Analytics to collect and process certain analytics data. Google provides some additional privacy options described at www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/ regarding Google Analytics cookies.
    
    Webnovel does not process or respond to web browsers’ “do not track” signals or other similar transmissions that indicate a request to disable online tracking of users who visit our Site or who use our Service.
    

* **Location Information.** We may obtain information about your physical location, such as by use of GPS and other geolocation features in your device, or by inference from other information we collect (for example, your IP address indicates the general geographic region from which you are connecting to the Internet).
* **Third Party Web Beacons and Third Party Buttons.** We may display third-party content on the Service, including third-party advertising. Third-party content may use cookies, web beacons, or other mechanisms for obtaining data in connection with your viewing of the third party content on the Service. Additionally, we may implement third party buttons (such as Facebook “like” or “share” buttons) that may function as web beacons even when you do not interact with the button. Information collected through third-party web beacons and buttons is collected directly by these third parties, not by Webnovel. Information collected by a third party in this manner is subject to that third party’s own data collection, use, and disclosure policies.
* **Information from Other Sources.** We may obtain information from third parties and sources other than the Service, such as our partners and advertisers.
* **Publicly accessible sources**. We may collect information about you, such as \[Google, Facebook, Twitter\] from publicly accessible sources, including \[username, avatar, location\].

**2\. How We Use the Personal Information We Collect.**

* We use the Personal Information that we collect on the Service to operate, maintain, enhance and provide all features of the Service, to provide services and information that you request, to respond to comments and questions and otherwise to provide support to users, to contact you for administrative purposes such as customer service, and to process and deliver entries and rewards in connection with promotions that may be offered from time to time on the Service.

**5\. Third-Party Services**

The Service may contain features or links to websites and services provided by third parties.

We encourage you to learn about third parties’ privacy and security policies before providing them with information.

**6\. Children' s Privacy**

Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. Our Site is a general audience site not directed to children under the age of 16, and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 16 without obtaining parental consent. If we learn that Personal Information has been collected on the Services from persons under 16 years of age and without verifiable parental consent, then we will take the appropriate steps to delete this Personal Information. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under 16 years of age has obtained an account on the Services or that we may have collected information from that child through our Services, then you may alert us at[service@webnovel.com](mailto:service@webnovel.com) and request that we delete that child’s Personal Information from our systems.

**7\. Data Security and Retention**

We use certain physical, managerial, and technical safeguards that are designed to to appropriately protect Personal Information against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, unauthorized alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, misuse, and any other unlawful form of processing of the Personal Information in our possession. Please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot and do not guarantee that information about you will not be accessed, viewed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.

We take measures to delete your Personal Information or keep it in a form that does not permit identifying you when this information is no longer necessary for the purposes for which we process it, unless we are required by law to keep this information for a longer period. When determining the retention period, we take into account various criteria, such as the type of products and services requested by or provided to you, the nature and length of our relationship with you, possible re-enrolment with our products or services, the impact on the services we provide to you if we delete some information from or about you, mandatory retention periods provided by law and the statute of limitations.

We may transfer your Personal Information to countries other than the country where you are located, including to Hong Kong. When we transfer Personal Information outside of the European Economic Area, we will comply with applicable EU data protection laws. We may transfer your Personal Information to countries which provide an adequate level of protection under EU law, or we may use contractual protections for the transfer of Personal Information.  You may contact us as specified below to obtain a copy of the safeguards we use to transfer Personal Information outside of the European Economic Area.
