**4 - HOW THE SITE WORKS**

We partner with a third party to provide a Survey Widget that allows an account holder to participate in surveys straight from our site. In addition, we scour the Internet for links to sites that offer the Free Survey Links and provide the Free Survey Links to our users. We also display offers for various opportunities including income-earning opportunities (“Earning Opportunities”), to qualified users. Not all users will qualify for each survey or for every opportunity. We may not display a survey offer or an Earning Opportunity to a user if we believe they don’t qualify for the offer or Earning Opportunity.

We may also display ads and other promotions for various goods or services offered by our marketing partners. 

We’re able to provide the Survey Widget, Free Survey Links and Earning Opportunities at no charge to our users by our users providing us with information about themselves that enables us to identify products and services that may interest them and sharing this information with our marketing partners in accordance with our Privacy Policy. Our marketing partners and survey and Earning Opportunity providers (“Providers”) compensate us for connecting them with interested consumers. 

To qualify to get access to the Survey Widget, Free Survey Links, Earning Opportunities and other promotions, you will need to enter a valid e-mail address and other identifying information (name, address, city, state, city, phone, gender and dob) and respond to a series of survey questions in the “Questionnaire.” At the end of the Questionnaire, you will need to provide a password in order to create an account. On our registration and throughout the Questionnaire and display of Offers we also ask you to consent to be called and/or texted by certain named marketing partners. You do not need to consent to be called or texted to purchase the advertised item or to gain access to the Survey Widget, Free Survey Links or to be displayed an Earning Opportunity. You have no obligation to purchase or respond to any of the advertised offers. The Survey Widget is available after the Questionnaire and advertiser offers. If you click on a particular link in the Questionnaire or on a advertised offer, you will be directed to a website operated by the provider of the Free Survey or Earning Opportunity. Follow the instructions on that website. The available surveys and Earning Opportunities may change from time to time so please stop back and see what’s available.

**You understand and agree that Surveys2Cash is not responsible or liable in any manner whatsoever for: (i) your use of, or inability to use and/or qualify for, any Survey and Earning Opportunity; (ii) any dispute between you and any Merchant and/or third-party provider of a Survey or Earning Opportunity; (iii) any modification, suspension or discontinuation of any Survey and Earning Opportunity; or (iv) any dispute or support issues with our partner for the survey widget - support is available through the widget itself.**

**16 - DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS**

The Agreement shall be treated as though it were executed and performed in the State of New York and shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York (without regard to conflict of law principles). **Should a dispute arise concerning the Surveys2Cash Offerings, the terms and conditions of the Agreement or the breach of same by any party hereto: (a) the parties agree to submit their dispute for resolution by arbitration before a reputable arbitration organization as mutually agreed upon by the parties in New York, NY, in accordance with the then current commercial arbitration rules of a reputable arbitration organization as mutually agreed upon by the parties; and (b) you agree to first commence a formal dispute proceeding by completing and submitting an Initial Dispute Notice which can be found** [**here**](https://surveys2cash.com/Surveys2Cash_Initial_Dispute_Notice.pdf)**. We may choose to provide you with a final written settlement offer after receiving your Initial Dispute Notice ("Final Settlement Offer"). If we provide you with a Final Settlement Offer and you do not accept it, or we cannot otherwise satisfactorily resolve your dispute, you can submit your dispute for resolution by arbitration before a reputable arbitration organization as mutually agreed upon by the parties, in your county of residence, by filing a separate Demand for Arbitration, which is also available on the Site** [**here**](https://surveys2cash.com/Surveys2Cash_Demand_for_Arbitration.pdf)**. For claims of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) or less, you can choose whether the arbitration proceeds in person, by telephone or based only on submissions. If the arbitrator awards you relief that is greater than our Final Settlement Offer, then we will pay all filing, administration and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration and, if you retained an attorney to represent you in connection with the arbitration, we will reimburse any reasonable attorneys' fees that your attorney accrued for investigating, preparing and pursuing the claim in arbitration. Any award rendered shall be final and conclusive to the parties and a judgment thereon may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to preclude any party from: (i) seeking injunctive relief in order to protect its rights pending an outcome in arbitration; and/or (ii) pursuing the matter in small claims court rather than arbitration. Although we may have a right to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses if we prevail in arbitration, we will not seek such an award from you unless the arbitrator determines that your claim was frivolous.**

**To the extent permitted by law, you agree that you will not bring, join or participate in any class action lawsuit as to any claim, dispute or controversy that you may have against Surveys2Cash and/or its employees, officers, directors, members, representatives and/or assigns. You agree to the entry of injunctive relief to stop such a lawsuit or to remove you as a participant in the suit. You agree to pay the attorney's fees and court costs that Surveys2Cash incurs in seeking such relief. This provision preventing you from bringing, joining or participating in class action lawsuits: (A) does not constitute a waiver of any of your rights or remedies to pursue a claim individually and not as a class action in binding arbitration as provided above; and (B) is an independent agreement. You may opt-out of these dispute resolution provisions by providing written notice of your decision within thirty (30) days of the date that you first access the Site.**

  

**17 - MISCELLANEOUS.**

Should any part of the Agreement be held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed consistent with applicable law and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect. To the extent that anything in or associated with any Surveys2Cash Offerings is in conflict or inconsistent with the Agreement, the Agreement shall take precedence. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that there is any inconsistency between these Terms and Conditions. Our failure to enforce any provision of the Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of such provision nor of the right to enforce such provision. The parties do not intend that any agency or partnership relationship be created through operation of the Agreement. Surveys2Cash may assign its rights and obligations under the Agreement, in whole or in part, to any party at any time without any notice to you. The Agreement may not, however, be assigned by you, and you may not delegate your duties under the Agreement. Headings are for reference purposes only and in no way define, limit, construe or describe the scope or extent of such section.
