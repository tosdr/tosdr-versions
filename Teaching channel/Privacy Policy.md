We maintain reasonable administrative, physical and technical safeguards for all user information collected through our Services. All information provided to Teaching Channel is transmitted using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. SSL is a proven coding system that lets your browser automatically encrypt, or scramble, data before you send it to us. We also protect account information by placing it on a secure portion of our Site that is only accessible by certain qualified employees of Teaching Channel. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet, wi-fi, Bluetooth, or other communication protocol is guaranteed to be 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of such information.

### Other International Users

If you are visiting the Site from outside of the United States, your connection may be made through and to servers located in the United States, your registration, entries and orders placed through the Site may be fully processed in and from the United States, and all information you provide may be processed and maintained in our web servers and internal systems located within the United States. The data protection and other laws of the United States and other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country, but please be assured that we take steps to ensure that your privacy is protected.

This online privacy policy applies only to information collected through the Services and not to information collected offline, or to information we do not deliberately collect or need for the provision of the Site, but which you may independently volunteer to send us, whether online or offline.

### Reasonable Efforts

We will use reasonable efforts to comply with this Privacy Policy and will take prompt corrective action when we learn of any failure to comply with our Privacy Policy. We sometimes release beta versions of our products and services, which are further refined before the release of the final version. Because these products and services are still in a test phase, we may not always catch an unintended privacy issue, despite our efforts to do so. As such, we welcome feedback on any privacy concerns you may have. In light of the above and because of the complex and constantly changing nature of our technology and business, and the security risks associated with using the Internet, we do not guarantee error-free performance under this Privacy Policy. TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER LAW, TEACHING CHANNEL SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES RELATING TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY.

### Notice of Privacy Rights of California Residents

If you are a resident of the state of California, the following rights are available to you under the California Consumer Privacy Act.

### Right to access

You also have the right to request that we provide your personal information to you in a readily useable format.

### Right to request deletion

You have the right to request that we delete personal information that we collected from you. Note, however, that certain requests to delete personal information may be denied if we are required or authorized to retain the information as a matter of law, the information is necessary for detecting security incidents, exercising free speech, protecting or defending against legal claims, or for internal uses reasonably aligned with consumer expectations, including, but not limited to, to provide a customer requested product or service. Historical transactional records cannot be deleted.

### Right to non-discrimination

You have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by Teaching Channel for exercising these privacy rights. We do not offer financial incentives related to the provision of data.

_Authorized agent_

You have the right to designate an authorized agent to make these requests on your behalf. To exercise any of these rights, please e-mail us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.teachingchannel.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). To protect your privacy, you will be required to provide authenticating information prior to making changes or gaining access to your information. We will respond to inquiries, requests to review, and change requests to personal information within forty-five (45) days.

#### Sales of Personal Information

Teaching Channel does not sell your personal information.

### Opt-Out Policy

Teaching Channel has adopted a policy of not sharing your personal information with our affiliates for their direct marketing purposes if you request that we do not do so (the “**Opt-Out Policy**”). You may make such a request by sending us an e-mail at p[\[email protected\]](https://www.teachingchannel.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). When contacting us, please indicate your name, address, e-mail address, and what personal information you do not want us to share with our affiliates for their direct marketing purposes. Please note that there is no charge for controlling the sharing of your personal information or for processing this request.

### Notice of Financial Incentive

This Notice of Financial Incentive includes an explanation of financial incentives we may offer California residents when they provide us with personal information. Those incentives are reasonably related to the information’s value, as permitted by the CCPA. The material aspects of any financial incentive will be explained and described when you sign up.   
Your participation in these programs is optional. If you choose to participate, you may withdraw at any time by contacting us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.teachingchannel.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

The financial incentives offered by Teaching Channel from time to time in exchange for personal information are commonly percentage/promotional discount codes to be applied to a single purchase (typically in exchange for an email address or for joining a member rewards program). The discounts may result in a range of savings to the consumer, depending on the details of the purchase.

Incentives, including percentage/promotional discounts, are not directly tied to, or exclusively based upon, a set value of any individual element of consumer data, but are reasonably based in good faith on the following considerations:

* Some consumers first experience our brand online and offering an incentive provides a unique opportunity for them to explore our products.
* Some of Teaching Channel’s marketing and advertising activities are done online and email communications are a key part of reaching existing and potential consumers in a manner which they both expect and that allows for them to exercise choices about how or whether or not to be contacted.

Discounts may also be affected by factors such as performance targets, geographic location, seasonality, and market trends.

### International Visitors and Data Transfers

If you are accessing the site from the EU or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from the laws of the United States, please note that you are transferring your personal data to the United States and by providing your personal data you consent to that transfer. When we transfer personal data from other countries, including to the United States, we use a variety of legal mechanisms to help ensure your data is appropriately protected.

### Your European Privacy Rights:

If you reside or otherwise find yourself in the European Union (“**EU**”) and the European Economic Area (“**EEA**”), Teaching Channel is committed to processing your personal data lawfully and facilitating the exercise of your rights granted by the General Data Protection Regulation (“**GDPR**”) and its implementing national laws.

### Legal basis for data collection and use:

We only collect and use personal information when there is a fair and legal basis for its collection and use and/or when you have consented to our collection. For example, we collect personal information because it is necessary to complete or carry out a user-request, including a user-requested order for products or services, to meet our legitimate interests to send marketing materials or to comply with legal obligations. All other collection and use of information is based on your consent.
