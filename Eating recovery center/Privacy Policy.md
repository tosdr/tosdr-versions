California Residents
--------------------

The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) requires us to provide California residents with certain information about how we handle their personal information.

As described in this privacy policy, we collect this information when you visit our websites. We collect information because it is necessary to provide, operate, maintain and support our services, as well as to administer and promote our business. Please refer to the other sections of our privacy policy for further detail.

**Exercising your Rights**

California residents have the right to make the following requests, up to twice every 12 months:

* The right to request the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you.
* The right to request that we disclose what personal information we collect, use, disclose, or sell.
* The right to request that we delete personal information that we have collected about you (subject to certain exceptions).

We do not sell your information for money. We do disclose your information to certain third parties that provide valuable services to us, such as analytics and advertising services, which we do not believe is considered a “sale” under the CCPA. Categories of third parties with whom we have shared personal information in the last 12 months include third-party integrations for advertising and website analytics.

California Civil Code § 1798.83 permits our visitors who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third-parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please contact us and indicate whether you are a California resident.

In accordance with CCPA, should you elect to exercise your rights under CCPA, we will not: (i) deny you goods or services; (ii) charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including by use of discounts, benefits, or penalties; (iii) provide you a different level or quality of goods or services; or (iv) threaten or imply that you may receive a different level of goods or services.
