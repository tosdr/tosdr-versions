3. **The Service**

3.1. The Service enables you to register a Patient Access account without linking to your GP practice, providing (but not limited to) the following features:

* Book appointments for a variety of healthcare services that may be made available by our partner services independently of your GP practice.
* A ‘Get health advice’ service that helps you search for symptoms and find articles to support your healthcare.
* A ‘Medication Assistant service that allows you to receive information and notifications to help you better manage your medication and set your own reminders to help you to take your medication in accordance with your prescription (‘**Medication Reminders**’).
* Find NHS Self-Referral services by area.
* Read the latest health articles.

3.2. Additionally the Service enables you to register and link to your GP practice. If your GP practice supports Patient Access you will have access to the following features where they are able to provide them:

* Book face-to-face, video or remote appointments with your GP or other healthcare practitioners at your GP practice.
* Request repeat prescriptions via a nominated pharmacy.
* Send messages to your GP practice.
* Act as a proxy on behalf of your relative or dependent.
* A ‘Contact your GP and get health advice’ service that helps you search for symptoms and submit them to your GP.
* Remotely access details in respect of your medical records which are held by your GP Practice. Access is dependent upon a number of factors, including that: (i) the relevant GP Practice use a compatible clinical system; (ii) the relevant GP Practice has activated the functionality within its clinical systems so that the Service is accessible to you for use and (iii) you successfully complete the registration process.
* A ‘Clinical Research Studies’ service that allows you to receive information and notifications about clinical trials that you may be eligible to participate in and, if you’re interested in participating, share your details with the relevant party conducting the trial. You must have remote access your medical records (as mentioned above) in order to use this part of the Service.  
      
    Furthermore, where you have signed up for the Medication Assistant service we will be able to provide information and notifications related to existing medications that we know of from your electronic medical record and/or that you input into the Medication Reminders service when setting up your reminder(s) (if any).

3.3. In addition to the services detailed in section 2, for accounts linked to your GP practice you also have the option to activate the Smart Pharmacy service. The Smart Pharmacy service allows you to nominate one of any of ‘Smart Pharmacies’ (being pharmacies that are set up to deliver this additional functionality) in your vicinity via Patient Access. If no pharmacies have registered as ‘Smart Pharmacies’ in your area then this feature will not be available unless or until this happens. Once you have nominated a Smart Pharmacy we will copy your NHS number into your account (to act as a unique identifier) and share it with your nominated pharmacy. We will then be able to provide you with notifications regarding your prescriptions (as may be provided to us by the relevant pharmacy), including details as to when it is ready for collection (or is out for delivery as appropriate).  
  
For the avoidance of doubt, the messages we send contain information provided by your nominated Smart Pharmacy (or your GP practice as appropriate). We are not able to validate whether or not this information correct (for example, if in fact your prescription is ready for collection) and it is provided on an ‘as is’ basis. You should address any issues with regard to the accuracy of such messages to your nominated pharmacy.  
  
Details of the various elements comprising the Patient Access Service are set out at the Website (as may be updated from time to time). Please ensure that you familiarise yourself with this information.

3.4. Save in respect of the Clinical Research Studies Service, your GP Practice is able to activate or deactivate (all or certain elements of) the Services set out in section 2 and 3.3 at its discretion in relation to some or all of its registered patients. If for whatever reason your GP Practice should choose to limit certain elements of the Service within its clinical systems then this will impact on your ability to use the Service and if this should occur then it is something you should discuss this with your GP Practice directly. While your GP cannot activate or deactivate the Clinical Research Studies Service, if your GP practice ceases (in part of full) to make your medical records available within Patient Access, then this may mean that the Clinical Research Studies Service will consequently be unavailable to you or have reduced functionality (i.e. if only parts of your medical record are available, it may not be possible to ascertain whether you are eligible for a particular clinical trial).

3.5. The Service is designed to be accessed via the Website or through our App.

3.6. After you have accessed your medical record you may be given the option of exporting or printing elements of your record. We recommend that you should only print or export any data where there is a clear need for you to do so. If you do choose to print or export any data then it is out of our (or your GP Practice’s) control and you are responsible for ensuring that any medical record data you export or print is held securely. We will not be liable for any disclosure of sensitive and personal data if such disclosure arises as a result of you using the Service to export or print out or otherwise share any information made available to you via the App or Website.

4. **Accessing the Service**

4.1. We do not guarantee that the Service will always be available or that access to it will be uninterrupted. Access to the Service (whether via the App, the Website or otherwise) is permitted on a temporary basis. We may suspend, withdraw, discontinue or change all or any part of the Service without notice. We will not be liable to you if for any reason the Service is unavailable at any time or for any period and you should ensure that you have alternative means of communicating with your GP Practice other than through the Service.

4.2. You are responsible for making all arrangements necessary for you to access the Service (including, having access to an internet connection and an appropriate Device or browser as appropriate).

4.3. You are also responsible for ensuring that all persons who access the Service through your internet connection and/or Device are aware of these Terms of Use and other applicable terms and conditions, and that they comply with them.

4.4. If you require any assistance with accessing or use of the Service then please see [https://support.patientaccess.com](https://support.patientaccess.com/) for guides relating to the Service, including details as to how to contact our support function. Please note that any requests for support containing language that we deem to be inappropriate or unacceptable will be immediately closed (and we may forward the communication to the relevant authorities as appropriate).

If we terminate (or suspend) your access to the Service then we will notify you by email or at the next time you attempt to access your account. Where you have linked your account to your GP practice, our ability to provide those GP practice enabled Services to you is dependent upon your GP Practice continuing to keep active the relevant functionality within their clinical system.

If you register to use the Service then EMIS may collect personal data about you (which may include name, date of birth, NHS number, e-mail address and phone number, the Device's phone number, username, password and other registration information (and if registering for the Service online, your sex, house number and postcode). This data will be securely held in accordance with the terms of our Privacy Policy (please see [https://support.patientaccess.com/privacy-policy](https://support.patientaccess.com/privacy-policy)).

14. **Share your record Service**

14.1. The ‘share your record’ service (which is an element of the Service provided at the discretion of your GP when you have linked to your GP practice) enables users to share elements of their medical record with third parties through functionality within the Patient Access service.

14.2. If you choose to use the share your record service then by selecting the relevant options you will be able to generate a secure link and a QR Code (which can be scanned by an appropriate reader) which you can share with a third party, who can then use that information (together with a passcode which you must also share with them) to access a read only copy of your medical record (or those sections of your medical record which you have chosen to share). For security reasons this link will be valid for a period of 24 hours from the time it is created, after which it will no longer work and you would need to create a new link should you wish to do so. You are also able to deactivate any valid link within the 24 hour sharing period at any time via the same section of the Service which you used to create the link.

14.3. You are responsible for choosing to share your medical record and you must do so with all due care. Please note that while you can revoke access via the share your record service at any time, while the link is live there is nothing to prevent any third party with whom you have shared the link from itself making that link available to other persons, and if they have the passcode from copying the data contained in the record or taking screenshots of the information. Given the nature of the information in your medical record it is your responsibility to only provide the link to trusted recipients that may need access to certain details so as to be better able to provide you with care (for example, if you were abroad then you may wish to give access to a local pharmacist to enable them to check whether you have certain allergies recorded in your medical record). By sharing your medical record, you acknowledge that this is done at your own risk.

15. **Choice of Law and Jurisdiction**

15.1. Please note that these Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with English law. You and we both agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales (save that if you are a resident of Northern Ireland you may also bring proceedings in Northern Ireland, and if you are resident of Scotland, you may also bring proceedings in Scotland).

15.2. The Service is intended for use by persons resident within the United Kingdom. If you are accessing or attempting to access the Service from any other location then: (i) we make no representations that you will be able to access the Service or that it will function correctly; and (ii) you are responsible for ensuring that you act in accordance with any applicable laws in whatever jurisdiction you are resident.

15.3. Use of the Service is not authorised in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of these Terms of Use, including without limitation this section.

16. **General**

16.1. We may update these Terms of Use from time to time, including, to reflect changes in law or as a result of changes to the Service or the addition of new features – it is therefore important that you refer to these Terms of Use from time to time to ensure that you are familiar with the relevant terms which govern your use of the Service. You should print off a copy of these Terms of Use for future reference.

16.2. The latest version of our Terms of Use will be accessible through the App and the Website and we will notify you of any material changes through a notice on our Website (and/or via the App). You may be required to read and accept our new terms to continue your use of the Service.

16.3. From time to time updates to the App may be issued through the App Sites. Depending on the update, you may not be able to use the Service until you have downloaded or streamed the latest version of the App and accepted any updated Terms of Use.

16.4. If any part of these Terms of Use is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of the agreement shall continue in effect (and if any of the sub-sections in section 2 are held to be invalid and are struck out then this shall not impact on any of the remaining sub-sections).

16.5. We will not be in breach of any of our obligations under these Terms of Use (or otherwise liable for any failure or delay in performance) if we are prevented, hindered or delayed in or from performing any of our obligations by any event beyond our reasonable control. The time for performance of such obligations shall be extended accordingly.

16.6. Subject to any specific terms detailed on the App or Website in relation to particular features or materials, these Terms of Use (together with the Privacy Policy and Cookie Policy) set out the entire agreement between you and us in respect of your use of the Service.

16.7. No failure or delay by us to exercise any right or remedy provided under these Terms of Use or by law shall constitute a waiver of that or any other right or remedy, nor shall it prevent or restrict the further exercise of that or any other right or remedy. No single or partial exercise of such right or remedy shall prevent or restrict the further exercise of that or any other right or remedy.

16.8. Any rights not expressly granted by us under these Terms of Use are reserved.
