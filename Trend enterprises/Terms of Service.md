**User Submissions**

We love to hear from you! Your comments and reviews are welcome on the Site. Any messages, ideas, photos, videos, suggestions, comments, or communications you provide (“User Generated Content,” or “UGC”) to TREND through reviews or other means grants TREND license to use, reproduce, publish, and distribute without notice or compensation to you. Publishing content on this website or through social media gives TREND permission to use your name, social media handle, and the published or provided text and images.

You Grant Us a License to Your UGC

By sharing your UGC, you are giving TREND, and its successors and assigns, a worldwide, perpetual, non-exclusive, fully paid license to use your UGC, including all copyrights, in all forms and media. This entitles TREND to copy, display, publish, modify and store your UGC anywhere and through any means, and that our right will not expire.

If you believe that a DMCA notice has been wrongly filed by TREND against you, you may send us a Counter Notice. These notices have specific requirements. We suggest that you obtain legal advice before proceeding with either notice as there could be substantial penalties for making false claims. Notices can be sent to us by the following methods:
