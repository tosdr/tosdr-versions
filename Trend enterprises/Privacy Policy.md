**Information from Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies**

We may use cookies to help us recognize your computer or mobile device. A cookie is a small text file that is saved on your Internet browser, computer, or mobile device. Cookies track websites that you visit, help us retain your shopping cart between visits, and enable us to recognize you next time you visit our Site. They are also necessary for setting up and accessing your account information on our Site.

Parts of our Site, such as your account information, will not function properly if cookies are disabled. You can set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent, or you can turn them off. However, if you turn them off, you will not be able  to purchase from our Site. You can learn more about cookies here: [http://www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/ "here."). We may also use other automated collection technologies such as web beacons and log files. These technologies collect information on how you interact with our Site, what web pages you visit, and whether or not you open an email we send or follow a link that we provide.

**How We Use Your Personal Information**

* We use your information to improve your shopping experience on our Site. We do so in the following ways:
* Fulfilling orders, including order processing, arranging shipping, taxes, delivery, and other fulfillment requirements
* Providing invoices, processing payments, and authentication, including credit card and purchase order information
* Screening orders to verify against potential risk or fraud, based on names and IP addresses

* Contacting you when you’ve indicated interest in receiving information/surveys, catalogs or mailings, becoming a TREND retailer, or joining our email list
* Providing reminders of items in your shopping cart and tailoring communications regarding products and services, offers, promotions, and other news that may be of interest to you

There are also ways we use your personal information that may be invisible to you, such as:

* Understanding traffic levels and interest in various areas of our Site to improve our Site and Social Media
* Evaluating the success of marketing and advertising campaigns by reviewing customer traffic to/from our Site

* Third parties, including Facebook, our email service provider, and ad services, may provide analytical measurements using your personal information as it applies to the services they provide to us

* Improving our internal processes, such as product fulfillment, customer service, marketing, fraud prevention, safety, and legal requirements
* Identifying market trends through data analysis to help inform new product development

Others may see any information that you share with us when you post publicly our Site and Social Media.

**We May Share Your Information with Third Party Partners**

Third party partners are services outside of our company that we use to conduct our business. We may share your information with these services to meet our business needs. Our third party service partners use your information to:

* Help operate our business: website hosting, fraudulent activity detection, data analysis, customer service, email delivery, etc.
* Process orders, authenticate payments such as credit card transactions, and fulfill orders
* Protect our rights and the rights of our users when responding to requests from government entities, or complying with legal obligations, such as subpoenas

* Comply with applicable laws and regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information we receive, or to otherwise protect our rights

Examples of third party service providers: 

* Website host

* Marketing / Ad services

Interest-based advertising networks collect and use your browsing history across various websites. This information assists in presenting you with ads and promotions that better align with your interests.

We may participate in advertising and marketing campaigns that tailor ads based on your information to serve you interest-based ads. We may then collect personal information as described above when those ads lead you to our website. We may use this information to improve our customer service and to improve your experience through more relevant communications and offers.

For more information about how interest-based advertising works, you can visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s (“NAI”) educational page at  
[https://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/how-does-it-work](https://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/how-does-it-work "Network Advertising")[](https://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/how-does-it-work)

You can opt out of receiving interest-based advertising here:  
[http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt\_out.asp www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp%20www.aboutads.info/choices "Network Advertising")

Opting out does not necessarily mean you will no longer see ads, they will no longer be tailored to your interests

* Google Analytics

* We also use Google Analytics to help us understand user behavior on our Site. You can read more about how Google uses your personal information here: [https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/ "Google Analytics Privacy")[](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/)
* You can opt out of Google Analytics here:
* [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout "Google Analytics Opt Out")

* In the event that TREND sells or transfers any relevant part of its business, your personal information will also transfer.

**Other Resellers and Linked Services**

Our products are available through many resellers, department, and specialty stores. Many of these operate their own websites, mobile sites, and social media sites. Our Site and Social Media may contain links to some of these resellers, advertisers, or co-branding partners. Information that they collect is not provided to TREND and we are not responsible for the collection, use, or disclosure of that information. If you have questions about their privacy policies, please contact them directly.

**We Protect Your Personal Information**

We follow industry standards on information security management to safeguard sensitive, personal information. We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption software to secure our Site. You are able to verify this on our Site (or any site) by checking the URL line of your browser. For sites that use a secure server you will see the first characters as “https.” Sites that are not secure will only show “http.” Depending on your web browser, you may also see a closed lock icon or unbroken key to the left of the URL. If you click on this icon, it will provide you with additional security information.

We maintain the highest industry standards for handling your credit card information. We are certified as a Level 1 compliant service provider, the highest level of compliance available. We use a third party payment processor for all purchases made on our site. **We do not keep your credit card information**.

We do not share, disclose, sell, rent, or otherwise provide personal information to companies for the purpose of marketing their own products or services. If we suspect fraudulent activity, our Site may automatically block certain potential transactions for a short period of time. It is each user’s responsibility to protect passwords and credit card information from fraudulent activity.

While we take every possible precaution to keep your information secure, there is never a 100% guarantee. Unlawful interceptions or access cannot be ruled out completely. Any transmission you make is done at your own risk.

**Retention of Personal Information**

We keep your personal information throughout your relationship with us. If you terminate our relationship, we securely store archived copies of your personal information for legitimate business needs such as for audit purposes and to comply with the law, except when we receive a valid erasure request.

Your actual transaction data (credit card information, for example) is only stored as long as is necessary to complete the transaction. Once the transaction is complete, we do not keep the transaction data.

We will continue to store anonymous or anonymized information, such as website visits, without identifiers, in order to improve our services.

**Personal Information from Children**

We take great pride in developing products for a broad age range, from young learners to senior citizens. However, TREND does not knowingly market to or collect personally identifying information from children under the age of 13. We will do our best to eliminate such information upon notice that it has been obtained. If you become aware that we have received information from a child under the age of 13, please contact our Customer Care department via email or phone, listed below.
