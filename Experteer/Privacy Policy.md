With the help of this privacy policy, you will find comprehensive information on about the processing of your personal data by Experteer GmbH, and the rights granted to you thereby.

Purposes and legal bases of data processing
-------------------------------------------

Experteer is your personal career service agency, which gives you access and transparency to the high-quality employment market. Our service will help you identify your position and opportunities in the employment market, and will help you take control of your career. You therefore confide in us with your career-related personal data, which we carefully store for these purposes, according to your preferences, and provided it to you as needed. Experteer provides you, with “Privacy by Design” in the view settings of your employment record, the ability to determine easily and in a distinguishable manner which data you wish to make visible to recruiters checked by us, and, in particular, provides the option to you to adjust this in varied ways for headhunters or for internal company recruiters.

You may create your employment record with your individual milestones, career goals and various attachments. This profile serves, on the one hand, to better match open positions and allows you, on the other hand, to make this profile available to headhunters and company recruiters in a simple, discreet and secure manner. You will be informed about relevant open positions via saved searches or the Experteer Career Newsletter.

Experteer is not an ad-supported business model and does not rely on marketing the “user as a product”. Our product comprises an online career service agency that we offer for professionals and executives. The candidate as the customer is the centre of our business model. Under this, you give us your trust and thereby give us considerable amounts of personal data about your career path and your goals. We commit ourselves to dealing with your data in full confidence and in your interest, and to support your career as best possible. Our business model is built precisely upon this, unlike free portals.

If you feel that we are not in keeping with the terms of this statement or the data protection provisions, please contact us at the following email address: privacy.us@experteer.com.

For the processing of your personal data, the provisions of the EU GDPR and all other applicable data protection regulations are complied with. Legal bases for the data processing arise are provided for specifically in Art. 6 EU GDPR.

We use your data for business contact, to fulfil contractual and legal obligations, to perform on the contractual relationship, to offer products and services, and to strengthen the customer relationship, which may include marketing and direct advertising.

Data entered related to your employment record and your career goals are provided directly to headhunters, recruiters, and/or indirectly via recruitment software providers and applicant database providers. These data entries are the core purpose and value added of the Experteer service provision and will always be shared according to your personal preferences. These data are specifically entered by you in your employment record, your career goal and applications, as well as any attachments as well as your user account.

Furthermore, the data you provide will be used for the contractual relationship with Experteer.

For the purpose of a better product experience, usage-related data is also collected. This allows us, in particular, to provide better matching with relevant agencies and headhunter clients as well as customer communication on the website or via email. You may also adjust the frequency of communication via email in your account settings.

Your consent also comprises the data protection permission requirement. In this, we will inform you about the purposes of data processing and your right of withdrawal. Should the consent also refer to the processing of special categories of personal data, we will point this out to you in the consent.

A processing of special categories of personal data, for the purpose of Art. 9 para. 1 EU GDPR, only takes place when this is required on the basis of legal provisions, and there is no reason to believe that your legitimate interest prevails to the exclusion of this processing.

Registration / Customer account (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a, b EU GDPR)
------------------------------------------------------------------

On our website, we offer users the opportunity to register by providing personal information. The advantage is that you may, in particular, store your profile data permanently, so that you may be found and contacted by headhunters and recruiters. In addition, when applying for job postings, you may easily share your profile information, significantly accelerating the application process.

The registration is therefore either necessary or option in order to fulfil a contract with you or to carry out pre-contractual measures.

In order to fulfil the services we offer, such as our CV check, which is intended to help you increase your chances of a successful job interview, we are supported by various service providers. A corresponding contract is set up with each of these service providers so that the protection of your personal data is guaranteed.

The principle of data economy and data avoidance is observed here, as only the data necessary for registration must be entered. These are, for example, the e-mail address and password including password repetition.

For the subscription to a premium membership, information on the billing address (title, first name, last name, address) must also be provided.

By registering on our website, the IP address of the user, the date and time of registration are also stored (technical background data). By clicking the “Register now” button, you give the consent to the processing of your data.

Please note: Your password will be stored in encrypted form by us. Employees of our company are not able to read this password. Therefore, they can give you no information, if you have forgotten your password.

In this event, use the “Forgot password” function, which will send you a link to re-enter your password via email. No employee is entitled to request your password by telephone or in writing. Please never give your password if you receive such requests.

Upon completion of the registration process, your data will be stored with us for the use of the protected customer area. Once you access our website with your email address with your username and password, this data will be made available for the actions you have carried out on our website (for example, for the subscription to a premium membership on our website). Completed orders may be tracked in the “My Account” area. Changes to the billing address may be entered here.

Registered persons are free to make any changes/corrections to the billing information in the “My Account” area. Changes/corrections will also be gladly carried out by our customer service, if you contact them. Naturally, you may also cancel or delete the registration and/or your customer account.

In addition, your IP address is processed due to technical necessity as well as legal security. Without this data, we would have to unfortunately reject the execution of the contract, because we would then not be able to implement it or would have to, if necessary, terminate an existing contract. Naturally, you may also provide more data if you wish.

Payment systems (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a, b EU GDPR)
--------------------------------------------------

On our website, you may pay by credit card, PayPal or direct debit (SEPA direct debit). For this, the relevant payment-related data is collected in order to execute your order and payment. In addition, your IP address is processed due to technical necessity as well as legal security.

**Doubleclick by Google**: On our website, we also use DoubleClick by Google (“DoubleClick”). DoubleClick uses cookies to present ads that are relevant to you, to improve the reports on ad campaign performance or to prevent you from seeing the same ads multiple times. In addition, DoubleClick uses cookies to track conversions related to ads. That would be the case for example, if you see a DoubleClick ad and later use the same browser to visit our website and register with us. According to Google, DoubleClick cookies do not contain personally identifiable information.

Based on the marketing tools used, your browser automatically establishes a direct connection to the Google server. By including DoubleClick, Google receives the information that you have accessed the relevant part of our website or have clicked on an ad from us. If you are registered with a service provided by Google, Google may associate the visit with your account. Even if you are not registered with Google and/or have not logged in, Google may be able to find and store your IP address.

The legal basis for the processing of your data is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f EU GDPR and our legitimate interest in the analysis, optimisation and economic operation of our website.

More information on DoubleClick by Google can be obtained at [https://www.google.com/doubleclick](https://www.google.com/doubleclick), as well as on data protection at Google in general: [https://www.google.com/policies/privacy](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy). Alternatively, you may visit the website for the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) at [http://www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/).

**Facebook Custom Audience**: As part of use-based online advertising, the Custom Audiences product of Facebook (Facebook Custom Audiences 1601 S. California Avenue, Palo Alto, CA, 94304) is also used on our website. Basically, a non-reversible and non-personal checksum (hash value) is generated from your usage data, which may be transmitted to Facebook for analysis and marketing purposes. For this purpose, a Facebook tracking pixel is used on our website. Information is collected on your activities on the website (i.e. browsing behaviour, visited subpages, etc.). For the geographical guiding of advertising, your IP address is stored and used.

The legal basis for the processing of your data is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f EU GDPR and our legitimate interest in the analysis, optimisation and economic operation of our website.

For more information on the purpose and scope of the data collection and the further data processing and utilisation, as well as the privacy settings, please refer to the Privacy Policy of Facebook ([https://www.facebook.com/policy.php](https://www.facebook.com/policy.php)).

**Twitter Advertising**: Finally, we also use the Twitter Tracking Code on our website (Twitter Inc., 795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA). A Twitter cookie is used. Information is collected on your activities on the website (i.e. browsing behaviour, visited subpages, etc.). For the geographical guiding of advertising, your IP address is stored and used.

The legal basis for the processing of your data is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f EU GDPR and our legitimate interest in the analysis, optimisation and economic operation of our website.

For more information on the purpose and scope of the data collection and the further data processing and utilisation, as well as the privacy settings, please refer to the Privacy Policy of Twitter ([https://twitter.com/privacy](https://twitter.com/privacy)).

**Google Tag Manager**: For reasons of transparency, we would like to point out that we use Google Tag Manager. Google Tag Manager does not collect personally identifiable information. The Tag Manager makes it easier for us to integrate and manage our tags. Tags are small code elements that can be used, among other things, to measure traffic and visitor behaviour, track the impact of online advertising and social channels, set up remarketing and audience targeting, and test and optimise websites. If you have opted out, this opt out is taken into account be the Google Tag Manager. For more information on Google Tag Manager see: [https://www.google.com/tagmanager/use-policy.html](https://www.google.com/tagmanager/use-policy.html).

Monitoring / Web tracking process
---------------------------------

**Google Analytics**: Our website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc. (Google). Google Analytics uses cookies, which are text files that are stored on your computer and that allow your use of the website to be analysed. Google Analytics also uses, among other things, the DoubleClick cookie mentioned above, to target, optimise, and present ads based on previous visits by a user to our site. The cookie stores, among other things, information on the IP address, the browser type and the operating system of the requesting computer as well as the URL of the referring website. The information generated by the cookies related to your use of our website is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. However, if IP anonymity is enabled for our website, anywhere within the member states of the European Union or in other countries that are parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area, your IP address will first be abbreviated by Google. Your full IP address will be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and truncated there only in exceptional cases. Google will use this information on behalf of this website’s operator to evaluate your use of our website, to create reports about the website activities, and to provide additional services connected with the website and Internet use to the website operator. The IP address transmitted from your browser as part of Google Analytics is not associated with any other data held by Google. You can prevent cookie storage by selecting the appropriate settings in your browser; however, we would like to point out that in such cases you might not be able to use all of the functionality of our website. In addition, you may prevent the tracking of the data created by the cookie related to your use of our website (incl. your IP address) to Google, and the processing of this data by Google, by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available at the following link [http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

On our website, we use Google Analytics that also includes the functions of Universal Analytics. Universal Analytics makes it possible to analyse the activities on our pages across devices (e.g. access via laptop/tablet). This is made possible by the pseudonymous assignment of a user ID to a user. Such an assignment takes place, for example, when you register for a customer account and/or log in to your customer account. To prevent this tracking, please use the following link: [http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

**Sentry**: We use Sentry to collect error messages from our online platform. In the process, usage data (called URL, website status) and technical data (browser information, IP) are collected and processed. We collect this data on the basis of legitimate interests for the purpose of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f EU GDPR, in order to constantly improve our systems and to prevent security gaps.

We have entered into a data processing agreement with Functional Software Inc. (Sentry), which commits Sentry to compliance with EU data protection standards. Sentry is also certified under the Privacy Shield Agreement, providing an additional guarantee to comply with European data protection law: [https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000TNDzAAO&status=Active](https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt0000000TNDzAAO&status=Active).

More information may be found in the Privacy Policy of Functional Software Inc. (Sentry) at [https://sentry.io/privacy/](https://sentry.io/privacy/).

**New Relic**: We use the performance analysis services of New Relic Inc., 188 Spear Street, Suite 1200, San Francisco, CA 94105, USA, for the purpose of collecting performance data from our website. These are stored and analysed, for logged-in users with registration of the respective user ID. If data is conveyed on to New Relic, this is done exclusively and completely anonymised. The legal basis for the processing of your data is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f EU GDPR. More information may be found in the Privacy Policy of New Relic at [https://newrelic.com/termsandconditions/privacy](https://newrelic.com/termsandconditions/privacy).

**Hotjar**: To improve usability and customer experience, we use the “Hotjar” web analytics service of Hotjar Limited on our website. Using Hotjar Limited technology, visitor information is collected and transmitted to the Hotjar Limited servers. The technology allows user activities to be collected, analysed and visualised while visiting our website. For example, we can use a “heat map” to identify which areas of our website are most visited and clicked on. Cookies are also used for this purpose. From the pseudonymous data utilised, we are not able to establish a direct personal reference. The legal basis for the processing of your data is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f EU GDPR. At any time, you may object to the collection, processing and compilation of data generated by hotjar.com, by following the instructions at [https://www.hotjar.com/legal/policies/do-not-track/](https://www.hotjar.com/legal/policies/do-not-track/). More information on data protection at hotjar.com may be found at [https://www.hotjar.com/privacy/](https://www.hotjar.com/privacy/).

Social network social plugins
-----------------------------

**Facebook**: We use social plugins of the Facebook.com social network, which is operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave., Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA. The Like button also uses such a social plugin. If such a plugin is called by our users, the user browser establishes a direct connection to the Facebook servers. As a result, the information on which Experteer websites were visited by the user is automatically transmitted to the Facebook server. For users who are logged in to Facebook, Facebook assigns this information automatically their personal Facebook account and stores them. A cookie may also possibly be installed on your computer, but deleted when the browser is closed. The purpose and scope of the data collection and the further utilisation of the data by Facebook may be found in the Facebook Privacy Policy at [http://www.facebook.com/policy.php](http://www.facebook.com/policy.php).

**Twitter**: On our website, we use features of the Twitter service offered by Twitter Inc., 795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA. If you visit a website with a built-in Twitter button, and it is uploaded, Twitter will discover your IP address and that our website was visited via that IP address. In order to use Twitter, you need a Twitter account. If you are logged in to Twitter on your profile and click on the Twitter button on Experteer, you will share the content of the page in which the button is integrated with other Twitter users. Twitter will then remember that you have clicked this button along with information about the page and make that information available to other Twitter users. If you do not want Twitter to directly associate the data collected via our website to your Twitter profile, then you must log out of Twitter before visiting our website. For more information about data collection and utilisation by Twitter and your right related to it, please refer to the Privacy Policy of Twitter at [https://twitter.com/privacy](https://twitter.com/privacy).

**Using the Shariff solution**: We are glad if you recommend and discuss the contents of our pages on social media. For this, we use the buttons provided by the “Shariff” extension. Standard social media buttons transmit user data with each page view, and give the social networks accurate information about your browsing behaviour (user tracking). You do not have to be logged in or be a member of the network. The Shariff social button only creates direct contact between the social network and visitors when the latter actively clicks on the share button. If the user is already logged in to a social network, this is done on Facebook without another window. On Twitter, a pop-up window appears where you can still edit the tweet. More information on this may be found at heise.de.

Links to other providers
------------------------

Our website also contains - clearly recognisable - links to the Internet sites of other companies. Although there are links to the websites of other providers, we have no influence on their content. Therefore, no guarantee and liability can be assumed for such content. The relevant providers or operators of these sites are always responsible for their contents.

The linked pages were checked at the time of linking for possible legal violations and identifiable infringements. No illegal content was identifiable at the time of linking. However, we cannot be expected to continuously monitor the contents of linked pages if there are no specific indications that an infringement of rights has occurred. If we become aware of infringements of rights, such links will be removed immediately.

Application portal (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a, b EU GDPR)

If you apply to Experteer as an employee: We are glad to hear of your interest in working for Experteer GmbH. We are aware of the importance of your data and process the personal data provided by you within the application form only for the purpose of the effective and correct fulfilment of the application process and for contact purposes during the application process.

In so doing, we respect the principle of data economy and data avoidance by providing us with only the data we need to fully review your application documents, i.e. your resume or to collect it we are required by law.
