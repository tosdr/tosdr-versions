**

However, ayeT-Studios may store and continue using or making available certain personal information that is related to you. For further information, please read the Data Retention section in this policy  
  
If you wish to opt-out from collection and use of precise location data for advertising, you can turn location services off through your device settings. The latest versions of iOS and Android allow you to limit which particular applications can access your location information.

Although this tool will limit the use of tracking data for targeting ads, companies may still be able to monitor your app usage for other purposes, such as research, measurement, and fraud prevention.  
  
You can reset the identifiers on your mobile device in the device settings. iOS users can do this by following Settings > Privacy > Advertising > Reset Advertising Identifier. For Android, the path is Google settings > Ads > Reset advertising ID.
