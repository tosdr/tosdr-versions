c) The Publisher must inform ayeT-Studios immediately upon becoming aware of the fact that an unauthorized third party has gained access data or that an unauthorized third party uses Publisher’s equipment, property and/or system.

4.1 The Agreement shall continue to bind the parties until and unless duly terminated by either Publisher or ayeT-Studios.  
4.2 Either party may terminate the Agreement with or without cause effective upon a three (3) days’ prior written notice to the other party; provided, however that termination will not be effective until all Ads scheduled to be delivered through the Service have been delivered.  
4.3 ayeT-Studios may suspend Publisher’s access to all or any part of the Service immediately, with or without notice, if ayeT-Studios believes in good faith that Publisher or any of Publisher Properties violates any provision, representation or condition of the Agreement. ayeT-Studios may choose to terminate the Agreement if such violation is not cured within five (5) business days after notice to Publisher.

Termination of this Agreement will not release the parties of any obligation accruing prior to such expiration or termination. The rights and duties of the parties under Sections 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9 will survive the termination or expiration of the Agreement.

**5\. Payment**  
5.1 ayeT-Studios Exchange Commission. ayeT-Studios shall pay Publisher the ayeT-Studios Exchange Commission for marketplace services according to the revenue share stipulated in the Publisher Agreement, an equivalent agreement between the parties, or, in the absence of a specific agreement, the standard ayeT-Studios revenue share. Publisher’s sole compensation under this Agreement (defined above as “Commission”) shall be derived from the Net Proceeds actually collected and received by ayeT-Studios in connection with the required User Activities. ayeT-Studios shall in no event be responsible for paying any Commission if the Advertiser fails to pay ayeT-Studios. In case that the balance of amounts payable to the Publisher is less than one hundred dollars ($100) or the equivalent thereof in the applicable currency, the balance will be carried forward to the following calendar month until (a) the balance of amount exceeds one hundred dollars ($100) or the equivalent thereof in the applicable currency, or (b) the Agreement is terminated. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, ayeT-Studios will pay out any accrued Commission amount by the end of each calendar year if the $100 threshold is not reached by the end of the then current calendar year. The billing period for the Commission is the calendar month if not otherwise agreed between the Parties. The Commission is due and payable within thirty (30) calendar days after the end of each billing period and in US-Dollar, if not otherwise agreed between the Parties. ayeT-Studios may deduct from the payable amounts the costs (if any) of the wire transfer of the payable amounts to Publisher’s bank account or of such other payment method as may be agreed between the Parties.  
5.2 No assurance of any particular earnings. Publisher acknowledges that, unless agreed upon separately in writing, ayeT-Studios provides no assurance that Publisher will earn any particular amount of Commission, that Publisher will recoup any expenditure made in fulfillment of its obligations under this Agreement, or that ayeT-Studios shall fill any percentage of available Ad space of any Publisher Property.  
5.3 Mediation Fees. Mediation Fees, if applicable, shall be due from Publisher and payable to ayeT-Studios as set forth in the Publisher Agreement.  
5.4 Taxes. Publisher is responsible for providing and maintaining accurate contact and payment information.  
5.5 Tracking. Publisher agrees and acknowledges that all tracking of User Activities will be determined solely by the ayeT-Studios Tracking Method. No other measurements or statistics of any kind shall be accepted by ayeT-Studios or have any effect under the Agreement unless agreed-upon otherwise. Publisher further agrees and acknowledges that the determinations of ayeT-Studios with respect to the Tracking Method and/or Commissions and other fees are final. ayeT-Studios takes commercially reasonable measures to ensure that its Tracking Method at any point shall meet technical industry standards, but it cannot guarantee the absolute accuracy of the Tracking Method. If discrepancies occur, the parties will negotiate in good faith an amiable solution, otherwise ayeT-Studios’s numbers will be decisive.  
5.6 Fraud. Fraudulent activity (“Fraud”) includes, among others and without limitations, (a) any action taken by Publisher, or anyone for whom in law Publisher is responsible, which is intended to inflate, either directly or indirectly, the Commission payable to Publisher; and/or (b) the generation of leads by a mechanism not approved or acceptable by ayeT-Studios, including the use of unsolicited email (SPAM) to promote Publisher Properties, automatic redirecting of visitors, blind text or misleading links, forced clicks, bots or any other method or automatic process that may lead to an artificially high number of delivered clicks or other User Activities. ayeT-Studios reserves the right, where it has a reason to believe in good faith that Fraud actually took place, to withhold or suspend payment of associated Commissions, unless and until Publisher provides evidence satisfactorily establishing the validity of such User Activities. The remedy set forth in this Section is cumulative and in no way limits or waives any other remedies available to ayeT-Studios.  
5.7 Incentives. Publisher may set up and/or operate incentive mechanisms that reward users for performing certain actions. This may consist of granting the user additional premium services within the Publisher Property or crediting virtual currency to the user that otherwise would have to be acquired. It may also include “real” (i.e., non-virtual) rewards such as real money, goods or other tangible objects, as well as rewards that have a monetary value outside its platform.

**8\. Disclaimers And Limitation Of Liability**  
8.1 Advancements; Quality; Deficiencies; Disclaimers.  
a) The Service, by its nature, needs to be updated and developed continuously over time. Updates ensuring and improving usability may introduce some changes in and to the Service. The aim of ayeT-Studios while introducing such changes is to improve the Service and Publisher’s use experience. Therefore, ayeT-Studios grants the Publisher access to the Service in its available form or version at the relevant time. Publisher acknowledges that changes to the Service might affect system and compatibility requirements. Publisher shall have no claim for maintaining or restoration of the Service to a specific condition or scope. Publisher’s causes of action in case of deficiency related to technical usability of the Services remain unaffected. ayeT-Studios therefore reserves the right to offer new features, to remove features from the Service or to change them. Publisher hereby consents to changes in and to the Service, as introduced by ayeT-Studios from time to time, and to additions, deletions, re-introducing and otherwise changes in features. In addition, Publisher hereby consents to the introduction of changes in properties, functions, or capacities of every Service element or features at ayeT-Studios’s discretion. Such changes may improve, but also reduce to a significant degree the effectiveness and function of certain features or even remove certain features entirely. In such cases, Publisher has the right to terminate the Agreement effective immediately upon notice. Publisher shall have no other claims against ayeT-Studios due to changes in and to the Service under this subsection (a).  
b) ayeT-Studios provides the Service in accordance with the state of the art. However, ayeT-Studios cannot guarantee that the Service is free of any defect or deficiency at any time. Publisher therefore acknowledges that the Services might not work flawlessly at all times. ayeT-Studios makes best efforts to ensure complete usability of the Service. At the same time, the software that is part of the Service (as any software) cannot be provided completely free of bugs and errors. In such cases, Publisher may only claim damages for deficient Service if the usability thereof is seriously and lastingly impaired.  
c) Publisher acknowledges that the Service may be subject to technical limitations. This applies specifically to the maximum memory capacity or maximum size of data.  
d) ayeT-Studios is entitled to delete data and/or refuse storage of data if the technical limits are exceeded and in consideration of the provisions of these Publisher T&Cs. ayeT-Studios will notify the Publisher prior to deleting the data to the extent such actions are affecting the Publisher.  
e) ayeT-Studios protects its systems against virus attacks. Despite all precautions, a virus attack cannot be entirely excluded. In addition, it may happen that an unauthorized third party sends e-mails using the name of ayeT-Studios without ayeT-Studios’s consent. Such e-mails may contain viruses, so-called “spyware” or links to web contents that contain viruses or spyware. These acts are beyond the influence of ayeT-Studios. Therefore, Publisher should scan for viruses all incoming e-mails sent under the name of ayeT-Studios. The same applies to e-mails of other Publishers or Advertisers.  
f) The Publisher should adequately document and report in writing to ayeT-Studios of any defect identified in the Service. Prior to reporting any error, Publisher should consult the Service instructions and possibly any other support for troubleshooting provided by ayeT-Studios (particularly lists with frequently asked questions, discussion forums about problems, or the like). Publisher will provide all necessary cooperation and assist ayeT-Studios in its efforts to resolve any issue with the Service.  
Excluded from warranty are errors that occur through external influences such as operating errors by the Publisher, force majeure, modifications that were not carried out by ayeT-Studios, or any other manipulations.  
8.2 Limitation of Liability; Availability.  
a) ayeT-Studios shall only have an unlimited liability for damages if it acted willfully and with gross negligence. In the event of any violation of significant contractual duties, ayeT-Studios shall also be liable in the event of simple negligence. Significant contractual duties (or so-called cardinal duties) in accordance with the law are only such duties facilitate the proper execution of the Agreement and such duties on the fulfillment of which the Publisher can rely.  
b) ayeT-Studios’s liability is always limited to the foreseeable damage in case of a violation of significant contractual duties.  
c) The typical foreseeable damage in accordance with the above subsection b. shall be no more than 2,000 Dollars per Account.  
d) The above-mentioned liability limitations do not apply to the liability in the event of injury to life, body and health or in case ayeT-Studios assumed a guarantee or in case of liability in accordance with the Product Liability Act. ayeT-Studios’s liability in accordance with Section 44a of the German Telecommunication Act (TKG) shall remain unaffected thereby.  
e) ayeT-Studios shall be liable for advice only if it concerns a problem with its Service.  
f) On an annual average, ayeT-Studios guarantees availability of 99.5% for each Service. Excluded from availability calculation under this provision are (i) periods, during which the server for the individual Service cannot be reached because of technical or other problems beyond the influence of ayeT-Studios (e.g. force majeure, culpability of third parties, and similar occurrences); (ii) periods during which regular maintenance takes place. In addition, ayeT-Studios may limit access to the Service if required for reasons of network security and operation, maintenance of the network integrity, and particularly to operations and measure to prevent serious malfunctions of the network, software or stored data. All the periods mentioned herein are not considered in the calculation of availability. ayeT-Studios’s liability for non-availability of the server shall remain unaffected in the case of intent and gross negligence. The Service may not be retrievable worldwide. Whether the Service can be retrieved fully or in a limited manner may depend on legal regulations and licensing requirements in particular countries.  
g) The above-mentioned limitations to liability also apply to the liability of employees, workers, staff members, representatives and agents of ayeT-Studios, in particular to the benefit of shareholders, employees, representatives, company bodies and their members with regard to their personal liability.

**9\. Indemnification**  
9.1 By ayeT-Studios. ayeT-Studios shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Publisher and its directors, officers, employees and agents (and successors, heirs and assigns) (the “Publisher Parties”) against any liability, damage, loss or expense (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) incurred by the Publisher Parties in connection with any third-party claim that the ayeT-Studios Services, in the form provided by ayeT-Studios, infringe any Intellectual Property Right of a third party, unless and to the extent such infringement arises from Publisher’s use of the ayeT-Studios Services in violation of this Agreement. In the event of any such threatened or actual claim, in addition to its indemnification obligations herein, ayeT-Studios will have the right to either (a) replace or modify the infringing or allegedly infringing components of the ayeT-Studios Services, or (b) immediately terminate this Agreement upon written notice to Publisher.
