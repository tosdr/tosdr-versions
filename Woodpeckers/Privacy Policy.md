WOODPECKERS, LLC AND WOODPECK.COM PRIVACY POLICY
================================================

**Privacy Policy**

**WHAT THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVERS**

This Privacy Policy covers the treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) gathered in order to establish and extend business and/or employment relationship with Woodpeckers, LLC (“COMPANY”, “we” or “us”), including but not limited to when you are using or accessing Woodpeckers websites and mobile applications (“Sites”) or information you have provided in other ways. This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any Personal Information that our business partners share with us or that we share with our business partners.

Woodpeckers Sites contain links to other sites that are not owned, maintained or operated by Woodpeckers. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that Woodpeckers does not own or control, including but not limited to any third party websites, services and applications (“Third Party Services”), that you elect to access through Woodpeckers Sites or to individuals that we do not manage or employ. While we attempt to facilitate access only to these Third Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party Services. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you access. **The inclusion of a link from or to Woodpeckers Sites does not imply recommendation or sponsorship by Woodpeckers and Woodpeckers disclaims any liability for such links.**

This Privacy Policy shall govern the relationship between the Company and any person (hereafter referred to as “you”) visiting the Sites. If you do not agree with any of the terms and conditions in this Privacy Policy, please do not access or otherwise use this Site or any information contained on this Site. Your use of the Site shall be deemed to be your agreement to be bound by this Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to amend the Privacy Policy at any time, for any reason, and with or without notice of any kind. Your continued use of the Sites after we make changes to the Privacy Policy is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check the Privacy Policy periodically for updates.

**GENERAL DISCLAIMER**

All information on the Sites are intended for the sole purpose of assisting you to make a decision with regard to our products and/or services. All information on the Sites are exclusive property of the Company. The Company grants you no license or any property rights to any such information. The Company does not represent and warrant the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of the information and other items contained on the Sites. Therefore, you shall not rely on any information provided on the Sites unless the Company expressly approves such in writing. The Company does not owe you any obligation until we accept your purchase order.

**WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

We receive and store any information that you enter on our Sites or provide in other ways. Several areas of our Sites allow you to make inquiries or request literature by filling out and submitting an online form.

Most of our Sites do not require any form of registration, allowing you to visit our Sites without telling us who you are. However, some services may require you to provide us with Personal Information. The information you submit during registration may include company information including address, fax, email, contract information, user information, user comments and survey responses.

In order to establish a business or employment relationship or complete a transaction with Woodpeckers, you may be asked to provide information such as name, address, telephone, email address, banking information, credit card number and other relevant information. In these situations, if you choose to withhold any Personal Information requested by us, it may not be possible for you to gain access to certain parts of our Sites and for us to respond to your inquires, including but not limited to providing services, completing purchases or sales, performing marketing actions, and meeting our contractual obligations.

Standard server logs with IP addresses are collected as part of a business critical need to prevent fraud.

**How Information Is Collected** 

* **We collect information directly from you.** The following are a few examples of when we collect information from you: during Sites or survey registration; in connection with an online or in-store purchase; if you subscribe to correspondence or newsletters of the Company; if you submit a request, information or other digital content through our Sites or via social media interactions on a third-party website; if you return a product or use a rebate; if you apply or inquire about employment; we may also ask you for information when you enter a contest (such as the “Woodworking Tool Giveaway”) or promotion sponsored by us and when you report a problem with the Sites, etc. 
* **We collect information from you passively.** We may use tracking tools like browser cookies, flash cookies, and web beacons.  We use your IP address, cookies, and tags to track user behavior on our Sites and to make usability improvements.  We also use cookies to maintain user session identity to store your username and password locally for ease of access.

* “Cookies” are small pieces of information that are stored on your computer’s hard drive. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies. You can edit your browser options to block cookies in the future or delete pre-existing cookies.
* An IP address identifies every computer on the Internet. Each time you connect to the Internet, your machine is assigned an IP address. 
*  “Tags” refer to scripts that are used to track a visitor’s activity on our Sites by Web analytics software.  A visitor’s activity is anonymous if he/she is not logged in.  If a visitor has logged in using his or her username and password, additional information is passed through these tags. 
* Flash Cookies. Certain features of our Sites may use local stored objects (or Flash cookies) to collect and store information about your preferences and navigation to, from, and on the Sites. Flash cookies are not managed by the same browser settings as are used for browser cookies.
* Web Beacons. Pages of our Sits and our emails may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs) that permit the Company, for example, to count users who have visited those pages or opened an email and for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity).

* **We collect information from other sources.**  We may get information about you from third party business partners, such as an updated address from a shipping vendor.

**HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

We may gather information that helps show how customers use the Sites. For example, we might do research to determine which areas are accessed most frequently. The information we gather when you visit our Sites or provide in other ways may be used to improve the products we offer to our customers. In the end, we hope this information will help us build richly dynamic Sites and valuable services that not only fulfill all of our customers’ industrial product needs, but also provide an easy-to-use interface and an overall enjoyable shopping experience. In effect, we want to tailor our Sites and marketing profiling so that our customers receive more of what they want from us and less of what they don't want.

Our Sites are designed to build HTML pages dynamically and according to account information. Therefore, the information that is stored within our databases is retrieved so that only those registered and authorized users have access to their account information. Email information is requested so that we can email you the related transactional documents for your order and for transaction processing within the business context as implied in our buyer and seller agreements. All other data collected through emails is used to improve our marketing communications with you.

We release account and other Personal Information when we believe release is appropriate to: (i) comply with the law; or (ii) protect the rights, property, or safety of Woodpeckers Sites, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable or credit card information for purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Policy. We may also share your information for our business purposes and as legally required or permitted. For example, we may share information with our service providers, vendors, distributors and manufactures of our products. We may share your information with third party companies so that you may receive future offerings about products and services that may be of interest to you. We may also share information with our affiliates or business partners who are running a joint promotion with us or who provide a product or service in partnership with us.
