Cookies Notice
==============

#### Summary

This Cookies Notice explains how Action Network (“Action Network,” “we,” “us,” and “ours”) uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our website at [https://actionnetwork.org](https://actionnetwork.org/) (the “Site”). This Notice explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.

#### What Are Cookies?

Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.

Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Action Network) are called “first-party cookies.” Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called “third-party cookies.” Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g. advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.

#### Why Do We Use Cookies?

We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for the Site to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on the Site. Third parties serve cookies through the Site for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.

_**Essential Website Cookies**_

These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through the Site and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas.

These cookies are served by Action Network ([https://actionnetwork.org](https://actionnetwork.org/)).

Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the Site to you, they cannot be refused.

You can block or delete these cookies by changing your browser settings, however, as described below under the heading: How Can I Control Cookies?

_**Performance and Functionality Cookies**_

These cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of the Site but are non-essential to its use. However, without these cookies, certain functionality may become unavailable.

These cookies are served by Action Network ([https://actionnetwork.org](http://actionnetwork.org/)).

To refuse these cookies, please follow the instructions below under the heading: How Can I Control Cookies?

#### What About Other Tracking Technologies, like Web Beacons?

Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called “tracking pixels” or “clear gifs”). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identified that enables us to recognize when someone has visited the Site or opened an email that we have sent the. This allows us, of example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within the Site to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to the Site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve Site performance, and to measure the success of email marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.

#### Do You Use Flash Cookies or Local Shared Objects?

The Site may also use so-called “Flash Cookies” (also known as “Local Shared Objects” or “LSOs”) to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of our services, fraud prevention, and for other Site operations.

If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust the setting of your Flash player to block Flash Cookies storage using the tools contained in the [Website Storage Settings Panel](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html). You can also control Flash Cookies by going to the [Global Storage Settings Panel](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html) and following the instructions, which may include, for example, instructions on how to delete existing Flash Cookies (referred to as “information” on the Macromedia site), prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash Cookies that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time.

Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit Flash Cookies may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with our services or online content.

#### Do You Serve Targeted Advertising?

We do not serve targeted advertising on the Site.

#### How Can I Control Cookies?

You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie preferences by adjusting your browser settings.

You can set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use the Site, though your access to some functionality and areas of the Site may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser to browser, you should visit your browser’s help menu for more information.

In addition, most advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of targeted advertising. If you would like to find our more information, please visit [https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN](https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN) or [https://www.youronlinechoices.com/](https://www.youronlinechoices.com/).

#### How Often Will You Update this Cookies Notice?

We may update this Cookies Notice from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this Cookies Notice regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.

The date at the top of this Cookies Notice indicates when it was last updated.

#### Where Can I Get Further Information?

If you have any questions about our use of cookies or other technologies, please email us at [support@actionnetwork.org](mailto:support@actionnetwork.org).
