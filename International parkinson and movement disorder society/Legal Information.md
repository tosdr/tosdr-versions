It is our policy not to disclose, sell or rent any of your Personal Information to any individual, business, government entity or other outside party. However, we may disclose or share your Personal Information (and you are considered to consent to same) if we have received your permission beforehand, or in certain circumstances, such as:

Once your Personal Information has been shared with a third party, we no longer have direct control over that information, but we require our contractors and others who help us provide the Web Site and services to agree to follow applicable Privacy Directives. 

Your personal information will not be collected for use that is in violation of applicable law or unrelated to that discussed in this Notice.   
 

Your Rights 
------------

We recognize that all Personal Information you submit to us belongs to you, and that we use your data only with your permission. You have the following specific rights (which are more fully described in our Rights and Responsibilities notice). 

* Informed: We will tell you exactly how we use your Personal Information in clear, plain language.

* Access and Portability: You may view such or your Personal Information as is accessible on our Web Site and request a copy of all Personal Information we may store that is not accessible on our Web Site. 
* Modification: You may request corrections, changes or updates to any personal data we store. 
* Erasure: You may request that we purge all or your Personal Information at any time. 

If you have any complaints on our processing of your Personal Information or if you believe that we have breached our own privacy policies or applicable law, we encourage you to contact us. However, please note that applicable Privacy Directives may provide you with a right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority as well; however, we ask that you please attempt to resolve any issues with us first. 

### Cookies 

A "cookie" is a small data file that can be placed on your hard drive when you visit certain websites. We use cookies to remember certain user information. Cookies are electronic identifiers that are transferred automatically to your computer through your browser that allow our computers to save certain information you provide us and store information about you so we can recognize you when you visit the Web Site in the future. This allows you to avoid logging in more than once, which saves time, and create a customized web site that fits your needs. You may, at any time, disable or refuse to accept cookies by changing the preferences or settings on your web browser. If you choose to disable cookies, you will still be able to use the Web Site. However, you will not be able to fully take advantage of certain automation and other functionality features available. 

We may use cookies to collect, store, and sometimes track information for statistical purposes, to improve the products and services we provide, or to save your settings and to provide customizable and personalized services. These cookies do not enable third parties to access any of your personal information. Most browsers accept cookies automatically but can be configured not to do so or to notify the user when a cookie is being sent. If you wish to disable cookies, refer to your browser help menu to learn how to disable cookies. If you disable cookies, it may interfere with the proper functioning of the website. 

Additionally, be aware that if you visit other, unrelated websites where you are prompted to log in or that are customizable, you may be required to accept cookies. Third parties and other unrelated websites may also use their own cookies. We do not control use of these cookies and expressly disclaim responsibility for information collected through them. 

Finally, we may occasionally enable and implement various analytic tools, such as Google Analytics, which is an analytics tool provided by Google to collect and process collected information and data consisting of certain telematics about your use of our Web Site. Google sets and reads cookies to collect such Collected Data and your web browser will automatically send such collected information and data to Google. Google stores and uses this data to provide us with reports that we use to improve the Website’s structure and content. For more information on Google Analytics, please see www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/. 

### Automated Information 

When you visit our Web Site, we automatically collect information from your browser or your mobile device, such as Internet Protocol (IP) address or unique device identifier, cookies, and data about which pages you visit in order to allow us to operate and provide the Web Site and our services. This information is used to protect the Web Site and our services and to keep the Web Site secure, analyze and improve our Web Site and services and understand how the Web Site works and for the other purposes described in “How We Use Personal Information,” above.  

We may use automated decision making in processing your Personal Information for some services and products. You may request a manual review of the accuracy of an automated decision if you are unhappy with it. You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing. 

### Email Interconnectivity 

If you receive email communications from us, we may use certain tools to capture data related to when you open our messages and click on hyperlinks or banners it may contain. We use this information internally to enhance and support our marketing and sales operations. 

### Surveys, Questionnaires, Social Media 

When you provide us with your Personal Information through social media or other online survey or questionnaire tools and platforms, or sign up for one of our mailing lists, newsletters, or marketing lists, we or third parties operating those tools, platforms or social media sites, may collect your social media handle or profile, and/or any other identifier that you use to be contacted online or offline. This information may also include personally identifiable and business information and whatever information or comments you may post on such platforms, but only to the extent that you voluntarily provide it to us. Anything you post on a social media platform or site is public information and will not be treated confidentially. Your use of social media platforms is governed by the privacy policies and terms of the third parties that own and operate those platforms and not by this Policy. We encourage you to review the terms contained in this Notice. 

### How We Protect Personal Information/Data Security 

This Notice, along with our Rights and Responsibilities notice, reflects a comprehensive approach to privacy and data security that complies with applicable Privacy Directives and generally accepted best business practices. We use commercially reasonable technical and organizational measures to help secure your Personal Information and prevent it from being lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized manner, altered or disclosed during collection, storage, and processing. The specific privacy and data security measures we use incorporate the following guidelines, as applicable: 

* No sensitive Personal Information such as credit card numbers, bank account numbers, passport, and social security numbers, is stored on our servers other than as required to perform a function for which the user provided such information, and in such cases where such information is provided, such information exists in our servers only for such transitory or other short period as is needed to perform such function, at which time is then purged from our servers; 
* We follow generally accepted best practices for secure software development; 
* All data is stored on physically secure hardware; 
* Personal data is secured behind network firewalls and access requires login credentials; 
* All data processed through web sites is encrypted in transit; 
* In the unlikely event of a data breach, we have policies in place to promptly notify affected parties; and 
* Data security is regularly audited by third parties. 

While our security measures seek to protect your Personal Information in our possession, no security system is perfect and we cannot guarantee that your Personal Information will remain absolutely secure in all circumstances or that any privacy settings or security measures contained on our Web Site cannot be circumvented. 

The majority of communications on the Web Site, including any submissions through available forms, are sent through the standard HTTP protocol and may be delivered using regular e-mail. Information sent over HTTP is not encrypted. E-mail, while convenient, does pose some risks (e.g., e-mail is not a secure form of communication, is unreliable, can be forwarded, etc.). 

If a security breach causes an unauthorized intrusion into the Web Site or systems that compromises your data, we will notify you and any applicable regulator only if required under applicable law. 

### Access to and Updating Your Personal Information 

If you wish to access, view, modify, update or erase your Personal Information as it exists in our records, please send an email to info@movementdisorders.org. 

We are not responsible for any losses arising from any inaccurate, inauthentic, deficient or incomplete personal data that you provide to us. For further information, see our [“Terms of Use”](https://www.movementdisorders.org/MDS/About/Terms-of-Use.htm) 

### Accessing the Web Site From Outside the United States 

The Web Site is operated and maintained by us from the United States. If you access the Web Site from outside the United States, please be aware that any personal information from you will be transferred to, stored in, and processed in the United States. 

### Third Party Web Sites 

To the extent that the Web Site contains links to other, third-party web sites, we encourage you to take reasonable precautions when sharing your Personal Information on third party web sites. Please be aware that we have no control over the content and practices of such other sites and cannot accept responsibility for their respective privacy or use policies. 

### Protecting Children 

The Web Site is not intended for children under 16 years of age. \[We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 16.\] If you are under 16, do not use or provide any information on the Web Site or provide any information about yourself to us, including your name, telephone number, email address or any screen name or user name you may use. If we learn we have collected or received personally identifiable information from a child under 16 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information.
