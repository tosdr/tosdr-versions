Cookies Policy
==============

The following document sets forth the Cookies Policy for the Savage Software Group Pty Ltd (Savage) website and procreate.com (the Site). Savage uses cookies to enable certain functionality.

What are Cookies?
-----------------

Cookies are a kind of short-term memory for the web. They are small pieces of data stored in your browser. They enable a site to 'remember' information between pages or visits, and are widely used to make the web experience more personal and engaging.

This page describes what information we gather, how we use it, and why we sometimes need to store it. We also share how you can prevent these cookies from being stored - however, taking this step may cause some features to function incorrectly.

How We Use Cookies
------------------

We use cookies for a variety of reasons detailed below. Unfortunately, in most cases, there are no industry standard options for disabling cookies without disabling the functionality and features they add to this site. It is recommended that you leave on all cookies, in case they provide a service that you use.

Disabling Cookies
-----------------

You can prevent the setting of cookies by adjusting the settings on your browser (see your browser help for instructions). Be aware that disabling cookies will affect the functionality of this and many other websites that you visit.

The Cookies We Set
------------------

If you create an account with us, we will use cookies for the management of the signup process and general administration. These cookies will usually be deleted when you log out. However, in some cases, they may remain afterwards to store your site preferences.

We use cookies when you are logged in to prevent you from having to log in every time you visit a new page. These cookies are typically removed or cleared when you log out to ensure that you can only access restricted features and areas when logged in.

This site may offer newsletter or email subscription services and may use cookies to remember if you are already registered, so we know whether to show certain notifications which might only be valid to subscribers or unsubscribed users.

This site may also offer e-commerce and payment facilities, and some cookies are essential to ensure that your order is remembered between pages so that we can process it properly.

From time to time we may offer user surveys and questionnaires to provide you with interesting insights, helpful tools, or to understand our user base so we can better serve your needs. These surveys may use cookies to remember who has already taken part in a survey or to provide you with accurate results after you change pages.

Sometimes we test new features and make subtle changes to the way that the site is delivered. When we are still testing new features these cookies may be used to ensure that you receive a consistent experience while on the site. They also help us understand which optimisations our users appreciate the most.

When you submit data to us through a form like those found on contact pages or comment forms, cookies may be set to remember your user details for future correspondence.
