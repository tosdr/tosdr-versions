#### Processing of Information

Kalibrr uses a variety of technologies, processes/methodologies, and techniques in its Kalibrr Platform and business processes to better serve both the User or jobseeker and the Recruiter.

The Kalibrr Platform uses advanced technology to find the best match possible for the User and a Recruiter looking for a candidate in connection with a job post. The Kalibrr Platform employs artificial intelligence to leverage the Information provided by the User to find a match with an existing job post. Similarly, a Recruiter is provided with a set of candidates that are relevant to the human resource requirements based on the job description it has provided, or other job posts that may become available in the future. This feature of finding relevant job posts is available for Users and shall complement the Recruiter search.
