TERMS OF USE

PURPOSE AND DESCRIPTION OF put.io’S SERVICES
--------------------------------------------

This means that no BitTorrent peers or files are controlled by us and you must have the legal right to download the content you are accessing through our servers; this service should not be used for any other purpose. If you want to check the legitimacy of the torrent’s data, please contact the relevant tracker owners.
