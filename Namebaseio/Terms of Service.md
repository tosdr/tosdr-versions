Terms of Use
============

These Terms of Use (“Terms”) are a contract between you and Namebase Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Namebase US, Inc. (collectively, “Namebase”, “us”, “our”, and “we”). By signing up to use an account through [](https://testnet.namebase.io/)[https://namebase.io](https://namebase.io/), or any associated websites, APIs, or mobile applications (collectively the "Site"), you agree that you have read, understood, and accept all of the terms and conditions contained in these Terms, as well as our Privacy Policy.

  

Synapse is our backend banking software provider, and partners with financial institutions to provide FDIC insurance. Synapse’s API, and their relationship with financial institutions, enables us to offer banking services and products. By agreeing to Namebase US, Inc.’s TOS and Privacy Policy, you also agree to Synapse’s [TOS](https://synapsefi.com/tos) and [Privacy Policy](https://synapsefi.com/privacy). By establishing a trust account, you authorize Synapse's banking partners, Members FDIC, to hold your deposits for your benefit in an account (“Trust Account”) by agreeing to the [Custodial Account Agreement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JyhlfD1Dtylvh51RqctVf3BlGxG1qhQz/view?usp=sharing).

  

You may not access or use the Site or accept the Terms if you are not at least 18 years old. If you do not agree with all of the provisions of these Terms, do not access and/or use the Site. Certain features of the Site may be subject to additional guidelines, terms, or rules, which will be posted on the Site in connection with such features. All such additional terms, guidelines, and rules are incorporated by reference into these Terms.

  

THESE TERMS REQUIRE THE USE OF ARBITRATION (SECTION 10.2) ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS, AND ALSO LIMIT THE REMEDIES AVAILABLE TO YOU IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE.

  

1. SERVICES
    
      
    1. General Namebase Services. Your Namebase account ("Account") encompasses the following basic Namebase services: (i) a hosted wallet that allows you to store, track and manage Handshake Coins only (the "Namebase Wallet"); (ii) functionality whereby you may sell Handshake Coins to Namebase or purchase Handshake Coins from Namebase; and (iii) use of domain name registration and related services on the Handshake Blockchain network (“Handshake Blockchain”) (collectively the "Namebase Services").
        
          
        
    2. The Handshake Blockchain. The Handshake Blockchain is part of an open source proposal to create a decentralized certificate authority composed of a decentralized blockchain with the intention to replace the current system of centralized trusted internet infrastructure. For more information on the operation of the Handshake Blockchain as well as the domain name registration and related functionality of the Handshake Blockchain see [https://handshake.org/files/handshake.txt](https://handshake.org/files/handshake.txt) (the “Whitepaper”). Namebase does not own or control the Handshake Blockchain, and all functionality related to domain name registration on the Handshake Blockchain are subject to the underlying protocol rules of the Handshake Blockchain, which functionality may be amended at any time without notice to you or us. The Namebase Services do not include any guarantee that the Handshake Blockchain will be functional or remain operational. Namebase is not responsible to determine whether the domain name(s) you select, or the use you or others make of the domain name(s), or other use of the Namebase Services or the Handshake Blockchain, infringes legal rights of others. It is your responsibility to know whether or not the domain name(s) you select or use or allow others to use infringe legal rights of others.
        
          
        
    3. The Handshake Coin. Users on the Handshake Blockchain must obtain “Handshake Coins” in order to engage in transactions for the sale or purchase of domain names on the Handshake Blockchain. You understand that the Handshake Coins stored in your Namebase Wallet can only be redeemed for Namebase Services, including for purposes of registering (or requesting to register via an auction) domain names on the Handshake Blockchain and cannot be redeemed for cash or goods or services of any other merchant or third party. Handshake Coins are “burned” (i.e., removed from circulation) upon redemption for a domain name on the Handshake Blockchain.
        
          
        
2. ACCOUNTS
    
      
    1. Account Creation. In order to use the Namebase Services, you must register for an Account and provide certain information about yourself as prompted by the Account registration form. You represent and warrant that: (a) all required registration information you submit is truthful and accurate; (b) you will maintain the accuracy of such information. You may delete your Account at any time, for any reason, by emailing help@namebase.io. Namebase may suspend or terminate your Account in accordance with Section 13. Namebase may, in its sole discretion, refuse to open an Account for you.
        
          
        
    2. Account Verification. During registration of your Account, you agree to provide us with the information we request for the purposes of identity verification and the detection of money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or any other financial crime and permit us to keep a record of such information as required. You may be required to complete additional verification procedures before you are permitted to use certain Namebase Services pursuant to our Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) and Anti-Money Laundering (“AML”) Compliance Program (collectively, our “BSA/AML Program”).
        
          
        
    3. Account Responsibilities. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Account login information and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your Account. You agree to immediately notify Namebase of any unauthorized use, or suspected unauthorized use of your Account or any other breach of security. Namebase cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with the above requirements. You are responsible for keeping your email address up to date in your Account. We assume no responsibility for any loss that you may sustain due to compromise of account login credentials due to no fault of Namebase and/or failure to follow or act on any notices or alerts that Namebase may send you. You agree to comply with Section 5.3 (Acceptable Use Policy) in connection with your use of your Account and the Namebase Services.
        
          
        
3. NAMEBASE WALLET
    
      
    1. Namebase Wallet. Your Namebase Wallet enables you to store, track and manage Handshake Coins contained in your Namebase Wallet and utilize the Namebase Services. Your Namebase Wallet can only store Handshake Coins and will not hold any USD, other fiat, or any other virtual currencies (e.g., bitcoin). You understand that all Handshake Coins held in your Namebase Wallet are limited in use, can be redeemed solely in connection with the Namebase Services and underlying redemption of Handshake Coins is limited to purchasing (or requesting to purchase via an auction) domain names on the Handshake Blockchain.
        
          
        
    2. Sale/Purchase of Handshake Coins. Eligible users in certain jurisdictions may sell Handshake Coins held in their Namebase Wallet to Namebase for the agreed upon price set forth on the Site. Handshake Coins can only be sold to Namebase; Namebase does not facilitate the exchange of Handshake Coins to other users or third-parties for other fiat or virtual currencies. Namebase may also, in its sole discretion, allow eligible users in certain jurisdictions to purchase Handshake Coins from Namebase. All Handshake Coins purchased from Namebase must be held in your Namebase Wallet. The Namebase Services facilitate the purchase of Handshake Coins only directly from Namebase from Namebase’s own inventory; Namebase does not facilitate the exchange of fiat or virtual currencies for Handshake Coins between users or third-parties. Namebase reserves the right to deny or delay any purchase or sale of Handshake Coins and does not guarantee availability of Handshake Coins for purchase or sale. You understand that you may be required to provide additional information and undergo Account verification procedures as set forth by Namebase in order to engage in any such transactions.
        
          
        
    3. Other Virtual Currencies. NAMEBASE CANNOT REVERSE A TRANSACTION WHICH HAS BEEN BROADCAST TO THE HANDSHAKE BLOCKCHAIN. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD YOU ATTEMPT TO USE YOUR NAMEBASE WALLET TO STORE, SEND, REQUEST, OR RECEIVE VIRTUAL CURRENCIES IN ANY FORM THAT ARE NOT SUPPORTED BY NAMEBASE. NAMEBASE ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH ANY ATTEMPT TO USE NAMEBASE SERVICES FOR ANY ACTIVITIES OR VIRTUAL CURRENCIES THAT NAMEBASE DOES NOT SUPPORT.
        
          
        
    4. Operation of Handshake Blockchain. Namebase does not own or control the Handshake Blockchain or the underlying software protocols which govern the operation of Handshake on our platform. In general, the underlying protocols are open source, and anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute them. By using the Site or Namebase Services, you acknowledge and agree (i) that Namebase is not responsible for operation of the Handshake Blockchain and that Namebase makes no guarantee of their functionality, security, or availability; and (ii) that the Handshake Blockchain is subject to sudden changes in operating rules (“forks”), and that such forks may materially affect the value, function, and/or even the name of Handshake you store in the Namebase platform. In the event of a fork, you agree that Namebase may temporarily suspend Namebase operations (with or without advance notice to you) and that Namebase may, in its sole discretion, decide whether or not to support (or cease supporting) either branch of the forked protocol entirely. You acknowledge and agree that Namebase assumes absolutely no responsibility whatsoever in respect of an unsupported branch of a forked protocol.

6. Electronic Fund Transfer Disclosure
    
      
    1. The following disclosures are made in accordance with the federal law regarding electronic payments, deposits, transfers of funds and other electronic transfers to and from your account(s). There may be limitations on account activity that restrict your ability to make electronic fund transfers. Any such limits are disclosed in the appropriate agreements governing your account.
        
          
        
    2. Definitions: Electronic Fund Transfer: Any transfer of funds, other than a transaction originated by check, draft or similar paper instrument, that is initiated through an electronic device or computer to instruct us to debit or credit an account. Electronic Fund Transfers include such electronic transactions as direct deposits or withdrawals of funds, transfers initiated via telephone, website or mobile application. Preauthorized Electronic Fund Transfer: An Electronic Fund Transfer that you have authorized in advance to recur at substantially regular intervals; for example, direct deposits into or withdrawal of funds out of your account.
        
          
        
    3. Your Liability: Authorized Transfers: You are liable for all Electronic Fund Transfers that you authorize, whether directly or indirectly. Unauthorized Transfers: Tell us at once if you believe your account or PIN or Access Information (as defined below) is lost or stolen or has been or may be subject to unauthorized Electronic Fund Transfers. Support message us immediately to keep your possible losses to a minimum. You could lose all the money in your account(s). If you tell us within two (2) business days after learning of the loss or theft of your account access device, or after learning of any other unauthorized transfers from your account involving your account access device, you can lose no more than $50 if Electronic Fund Transfers are made without your permission. For these transactions, if you DO NOT tell us within two (2) business days after learning of the loss, theft or unauthorized use, and we can establish that we could have prevented the unauthorized transfer(s) if you had told us in time, you could lose as much as $500. Also, if your periodic account statement shows unauthorized transfers and you DO NOT tell us within sixty (60) days after the statement was delivered to you, you may not get back any money you lose after the sixty (60) day period if we can prove that we could have prevented the unauthorized transfer(s) if you had told us in time. If an extenuating circumstance (such as extended travel or hospitalization) prevents you from promptly notifying us of a suspected lost or stolen access device or of any other suspected unauthorized transfer(s), the time periods specified in this Section B may be extended for a reasonable period.

        2. _Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution._ Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to Namebase should be sent to: 340 S Lemon Ave. #4341, Walnut, California 91789. After the Notice is received, you and Namebase may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and Namebase do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.
            
              
            
        3. _Arbitration Rules._ Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), an established alternative dispute resolution provider (“ADR Provider”) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration, including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (“Arbitration Rules”) governing the arbitration are available online at [www.adr.org](https://www.namebase.io/termsofuse/www.adr.org) or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last settlement offer that Namebase made to you prior to the initiation of arbitration, Namebase will pay you the greater of the award or $2,500.00. Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorney’s fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.
            
              
            
        4. _Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration._ If non-appearance based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.
            
              
            
        5. _Time Limits._ If you or Namebase pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.
            
              
            
        6. _Authority of Arbitrator._ If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Namebase, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Namebase.
            
              
            
        7. _Waiver of Jury Trial._ THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and Namebase in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND NAMEBASE WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.
            
              
            
        8. _Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions._ ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.
            
              
            
        9. _Confidentiality._ All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.
            
              
            
        10. _Severability._ If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
            
              
            
        11. _Right to Waive._ Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.
            
              
            
        12. _Survival of Agreement._ This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Namebase.
            
              
            
        13. _Small Claims Court._ Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Namebase may bring an individual action in small claims court.
            
              
            
        14. _Emergency Equitable Relief._ Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.
            
              
            
        15. _Claims Not Subject to Arbitration._ Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark or trade secrets shall not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.
            
              
            
        16. _Courts._ In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within San Francisco County, California, for such purpose.
