Placing an Order**  <br> <br><br>2.1.  <br>The information contained on this Website constitutes an invitation to treat.

Seller may or may not accept the Customer's offer at the Seller's absolute discretion.<br><br> <br><br>2.3.  <br>Upon receipt of the Customer’s order, Seller will verify the availability of the Product(s) and the Customer’s credit card or other payment details. Seller has not accepted the Customer’s offer and is not obliged to supply the Product(s) until Seller has shipped the Product(s) and sent an order confirmation to the Customer by email.<br><br>  <br>**3\. Supply of Product(s)**  <br> <br><br>3.1.  <br>Subject to these terms and conditions, Seller may agree to supply the Customer with the Product(s) as specified in the Customer’s order form submitted to Seller via this Website.  <br>  <br>3.2.  <br>When Product(s) have been shipped pursuant to the Customer’s order, Seller will email the Customer to confirm shipment.  <br>  <br>3.3.  <br>The pictures showing the Product(s) in this Website may not be identical to the Product(s) as shipped to the Customer.

Please note that depending on the processing time of the payment provider, refunds may take up to 30 business days to show up on your account.  <br>  <br>5.7   <br>All orders shipped cannot be cancelled but may be subjected to our casual return policy under [Returns & Refunds.](https://www.play-asia.com/info/helprefund)  <br>  <br>**Special arrangement for shipments to Brazil:**  <br>  <br>The Brazilian Tax Authority now requires all imported goods to document the following identification numbers CPF (for a natural person) or CNPJ (for a legal person).  <br>It is the user’s responsibility to provide the correct information. If incorrect, the parcel may not be able to clear the customs in Brazil and will be returned to us. In such occurrence, any additional fee (shipping and tax) will be charged to the user and no refund will be provided by Playasia.  <br> <br><br>**6\. Returns and Refunds**  <br> <br><br>6.1.  <br>Subject to Clause 6.4 below, no Product(s) shall be returned to the Seller unless:<br><br> <br><br>6.2.  <br>Upon satisfactory return of the Product(s) to the Seller, replacement Product(s) will be shipped to the Customer if the Seller is satisfied that the Product(s) returned by the Customer is defective after suitable tests and inspections by the Seller. If the replacement Product(s) is not available, a refund of the product price only will be made to the Customer. If the product is damaged, or faulty before leaving the Sellers warehouse, the re-shipping cost will be refunded or will be shouldered by the Seller.<br><br> <br><br>Please note that the perfect condition of product packaging upon arrival is not guaranteed. Advice will be given in such cases.  <br>  <br>Additionally, the Customer should report that the Product(s) are defective within 10 days from the time the order was received. <br><br> <br><br>6.3.  <br>If the seller is not satisfied that the returned Product(s) is defective, the Seller will deliver the returned Product(s) to the Customer at the Customer’s own cost.<br><br> <br><br>6.4.  <br>Software, video or audio discs that have already been opened are excluded from any return unless they are faulty. The Seller shall have no responsibility regarding compatibility issues and it is for the Customer to ensure that his/her computer, video/audio player is compatible with the software, video or audio discs as ordered.<br><br> <br><br>(a) the Product(s) in question is defective;  <br>  <br>(b) the Customer has completed and filed a Request for Return Form (showing the order ID and other identifying numbers) with the Seller;  <br>  <br>(c) the Product(s) sought to be returned by the Customer was ordered by the Customer via this Website, within 6 months prior to the date the Customer submitted a Request for Return Form;  <br>  <br>(d) the Seller has notified the Customer by email that the Customer may return the Product(s) to the Seller;  <br>  <br>(e) the Product(s) is returned in a clean and well-packaged condition; and  <br>  <br>(f) the Customer returns the Product(s) at his/her own expense which will include any customs duties or taxes.  <br> <br><br>**7\. Digital Products**  <br>  <br>Because of the nature of digital products, we are not able to know the identity of the person who ultimately redeems the code. We are unable to check if a code has been redeemed or not without redeeming it.  <br>  <br>For each order we ship, we track the day and the time at which the code was seen by the customer. Codes are guaranteed secured, provided they have not been seen by the customer. Once codes have been viewed, we considered it immediately consumed or safely kept by the viewing account. As we bare no responsibility, nor can we guarantee the validity of the codes after viewing action.  <br>  <br>**Digital Delivery**  <br>  <br>Codes purchased will be delivered directly to our Customers Playasia account. To reveal the code, simply click the "Show your code" button. By clicking the "Show your code" button, the Customer accepts delivery of the digital code. The IP-Address used will be logged in our record for this purpose.   <br>  <br>**Errors**  <br>  <br>We understand that there may be times where errors are encountered with digital products. With this, we need to ask for the following:  <br> <br><br>1\. Screenshot of the code entered  <br>  <br>2\. Screenshot of the error encountered<br><br>  <br>Once the information has been received, an investigation will commence within 5 business days.  <br>  <br>Please note that this is approximate and may take longer depending on the complexity and nature of the code.  <br>  <br>After the investigation: If the error with the code is confirmed, a refund or replacement will be given.  <br>  <br>For redeemed codes issues: If the code has been redeemed after the code has been seen by the customer, this is considered as used and we are afraid that we cannot offer a refund or replacement.  <br>  <br>Errors on codes must be reported to Playasia within 45 days of the date of purchase. There will be no refund or replacement for any error reported to us more than 45 days after purchase.  <br>  <br>**Region Locked Products**  <br>  <br>Most digital products are region locked and require the end-user to have the correct account to redeem them; for example, an iTunes Japan card can only be redeemed on a Japanese iTunes account. It is the sole responsibility of the customer to ensure that the code purchased is valid for his/her account being used. Region locks are stated in the product description. Refunds or replacements may not be available for issues concerning Region Lock.  <br>  <br>**Expired Codes**  <br>  <br>Customers should redeem the codes immediately upon purchase. Any issues concerning code expiry may not be subject for a refund or replacement.  <br>  <br>**Bulk Digital Purchases**  <br>  <br>For orders deemed as large quantity or high value, regardless of whether viewed or not after checkout, the product may not be eligible for immediate refund or casual return. Playasia maintains the rights to evaluate the return request and reserves the discretion to either decline it or initiate the refund in the form of Playasia wallet funds. Any associated or accumulated loyalty coins related to the canceled order may also be removed or suspended based on the evaluation.  <br>  <br>**8\.
