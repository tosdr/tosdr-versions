Introduction**  <br>   <br>1.1.  <br>Playasia.com knows that, how your information is used and shared, is important to you and we believe that users should be treated equally no matter where they are located. Please read this Privacy Policy to learn about the ways in which we use and protect your personal information.  <br>   <br>1.2.  <br>By visiting Playasia.com, you hereby accept this Privacy Policy and expressly consent to our use and disclosure of your personal information in the manner prescribed herein.

What Personal Information About Customers Does Playasia.com Gather?**  <br>  <br>2.1.  <br>The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your shopping experience at Playasia.com.
