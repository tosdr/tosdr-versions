5. **Purchasing; Price; Payment**  
    In order to purchase Merchandise, Auctions, Tickets, Services or any other products via the MLB Digital Properties or via Third Party Sales Locations, you may be required to provide complete and accurate personal information, including, without limitation, your name, address, telephone number, email address, credit or debit card information and shipping address. The [Privacy Policy of the MLB Digital Properties](https://www.mlb.com/official-information/privacy-policy) explains how such information provided to the MLB Digital Properties may be collected and used by MLB. With respect to the Shops, the **Privacy Policy of the Shops** applies to the collection and use of your personal information by Fanatics and/or Snow Commerce. With respect to Third Party Sales Locations, the privacy policy of any such Third Party Sales Location applies to the collection and use of your personal information by the operators and/or owners of such Third Party Sales Location. Your ability to make any purchase via the MLB Digital Properties may be subject to limits established by your card issuer. You must notify MLB immediately of any change in your credit or debit card information, including any change to your home address. MLB may bill you at the time the Merchandise, Auctions, Tickets, Services or any other products offered via the MLB Digital Properties are ordered or shipped, and the appropriate Club or Vendor may bill you at the time your Tickets are ordered or shipped. You must pay all amounts accrued in your account, including sales tax and shipping and handling charges, when due. MLB may in its sole discretion decline service to or terminate any account. Neither MLB, nor any other MLB Entity (defined below), nor Fanatics, nor Snow Commerce, nor any Vendor or any operator of any Third Party Sales Location is responsible, and must not be held liable, for any breaches in transaction security by any third party.  
      
    By purchasing any Merchandise, Auctions, Tickets, Services or any other products offered via the MLB Digital Properties, you acknowledge and agree that your credit or debit card (or other payment device or method) is being charged by MLB's payment processor or its vendor. For purposes of this Agreement, such payment processor will be referred to as a "Vendor."  
      
    By utilizing a credit or debit card for purchase of any Services or any other applicable products offered via the MLB Digital Properties, you authorize MLB to charge such card on the periodic basis as specified (e.g., once per month for monthly Services) in the amount described on the applicable purchase path. In the event MLB is unable to process charges to your primary credit or debit card on such periodic basis or in such amount, you authorize MLB to charge an alternative card saved in the Payment Profile section of your account.  
      
    If the account number, expiration date or other information of any credit or debit card account associated with your subscription Service changes, MLB recommends you update it as soon as possible. Please also be aware, MLB may acquire this current information from our financial services partner(s) and update the Payment Profile section of your MLB.com account to include such revised payment information.
6. **Sales Tax**  
    For certain purchases made via the MLB Digital Properties, MLB is required to collect sales tax. In states or regions that impose sales or use tax, a purchase is subject to tax unless specifically exempt. Purchases from the MLB Digital Properties are not exempt from sales or use taxes simply because they are made from the Internet or because MLB is not required to collect sales or use tax by any particular state or region. Whether any sales tax will be collected on a given purchase and the amount of tax charged depends on a number of factors including whether the seller is subject to tax in a given jurisdiction. The purchaser is responsible for any applicable taxes not collected by MLB and certain states require purchasers to file a sales/use tax return annually reporting taxable purchases that were not taxed and to pay such tax. For details, see the website of, or otherwise contact, the applicable taxing authority. If any sales tax will be collected directly by MLB in connection with a purchase, that amount will be shown either prior to the completion of any purchase or reflected in the final confirmation of that purchase.  
      
    For Oklahoma purchasers, applicable use tax on purchases made via the MLB Digital Properties may be reported and paid on an Oklahoma individual income tax return \[Form 511\] or by filing a consumer use tax return \[Form 21-1\]. The referenced forms and corresponding instructions are available on the [Oklahoma Tax Commission website](https://www.ok.gov/tax/)Oklahoma Tax Commission website: _https://www.ok.gov/tax/_.  
      
    For South Dakota purchasers, applicable sales or use taxes on purchases made via the MLB Digital Properties may be reported and paid on the South Dakota use tax form, available with corresponding instructions on the [South Dakota Department of Revenue website](http://dor.sd.gov/)South Dakota Department of Revenue website: _https://dor.sd.gov/_.  
     
7. **Billing and Automatic Renewal Policies for Certain Subscription Services**  
    For certain Services billed on a monthly basis (e.g., MLB.TV Monthly subscription Service), your subscription will automatically renew monthly during the current Major League Baseball season through and including October and annually on or about March 1 each year at the then-current Major League Baseball season's regular full monthly price, unless you cancel your Service prior to the beginning of the next applicable billing (and renewal) period. The primary credit or debit card you have stored in the Payment Profile section of your MLB.com account will be charged on or about the same date each month of your subscription during any Major League Baseball season and each subsequent year as set forth above. If MLB is unable to process these charges to your primary credit or debit card, an alternative card stored in the Payment Profile section of your MLB.com account may be charged. If you wish to cancel your monthly Service, you have two options: (i) you may cancel your monthly subscription in its entirety (including the annual automatic renewal of this Service in subsequent years) or (ii) you may cancel your monthly subscription for the applicable Major League Baseball season, but elect to annually automatically renew (i.e., re-start) your monthly subscription in the following Major League Baseball season. To elect either of these options and cancel your monthly Service, you may login to your MLB.com account, access the Audio/Video Subscriptions section and follow the applicable instructions, or send an email to [customerservice@mlb.com](mailto:customerservice@mlb.com). In no event will MLB provide partial or pro-rated refunds; see below for further details regarding refunds.  
      
    For Services billed on a yearly basis (e.g., MLB.TV Yearly, MLB.TV Single Team and MLB subscription Services), your subscription will automatically renew annually on or about March 1 each year at the then-current year's regular full yearly price, unless you cancel your Service prior to the beginning of the next applicable billing (and renewal) period. The primary credit or debit card you have stored in the Payment Profile section of your MLB.com account will be charged on or about March 1 of each subsequent year as set forth above. If MLB is unable to process these charges to your primary credit or debit card, an alternative card stored in the Payment Profile section of your MLB.com account may be charged. To cancel your yearly Service, login to your MLB.com account, access the Audio/Video Subscriptions section and follow the applicable instructions, or send an email to [customerservice@mlb.com](mailto:customerservice@mlb.com). In no event will MLB provide partial or pro-rated refunds; see below for further details regarding refunds.  
      
    In the event MLB discontinues or significantly alters a Service that you have purchased with automatic renewal, MLB (i) will notify you via email to an address you have provided to MLB, (ii) may provide information about similar or new Services available via the MLB Digital Properties and (iii) reserves the right to cancel the applicable renewal.  
      
    UNLESS YOU NOTIFY US BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF THE NEXT APPLICABLE BILLING (AND RENEWAL) PERIOD THAT YOU WISH TO CANCEL ANY AUTOMATICALLY RENEWING SERVICE, YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW AND YOU AUTHORIZE US (WITHOUT NOTICE TO YOU) TO COLLECT THE APPLICABLE SUBSCRIPTION FEE AND ANY TAXES USING ANY CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD SAVED IN THE PAYMENT PROFILE SECTION OF YOUR MLB.COM ACCOUNT.  
     
8. **Refund Policies for Certain Subscription Services**  
    MLB will refund the purchase price you paid for a subscription Service (e.g., MLB.TV or Gameday Audio) offered via the MLB Digital Properties if you make a refund request on the applicable MLB Digital Property via the account management tools in the Audio/Video Subscriptions section of your MLB.com account or via email to [customerservice@mlb.com](mailto:customerservice@mlb.com) within five (5) days of your initial purchase or within five (5) days of any annual automatic renewal date. In no event will MLB grant you more than one (1) refund during any given Major League Baseball season or provide partial or pro-rated refunds.  
      
    Should you wish to cancel your subscription Service at any time, you may login to your MLB.com account, access the Audio/Video Subscriptions section and follow the applicable instructions, or you may email [customerservice@mlb.com](mailto:customerservice@mlb.com). If such cancellation request occurs on any date following either the fifth (5th) day after your initial purchase or the fifth (5th) day after any annual automatic renewal date during any subsequent Major League Baseball season of your Service, then your cancellation will be effective as follows:  
      
    Current Yearly Service: If you cancel your yearly subscription Service as set forth immediately above, such cancellation will take effect at the start of the following subscription service year (e.g., a subscription service year for MLB.TV may begin on March 1 and therefore any cancellation of an existing subscription as described immediately above and prior to March 1 will be effective as of March 1). The Services to which you are subscribed will be accessible until cancellation is effective.  
      
    Annual Automatic Renewal of Yearly Service: If you cancel your yearly subscription Service as set forth immediately above, it will not automatically renew in any subsequent year.  
      
    Current Monthly Service: If you cancel your monthly subscription Service as set forth immediately above, such cancellation will take effect upon the completion of your then-current service month (e.g., a subscription service month for MLB.TV may begin on May 1 and cancellation of such a subscription as described immediately above will be effective as of June 1). The Services to which you are subscribed will be accessible until the thirtieth (30) day after your most recent billing date.  
      
    Annual Automatic Renewal of Monthly Service: If you cancel your monthly subscription Service as set forth immediately above, it will not automatically renew annually in any subsequent year, unless you elect at the time of your cancellation to renew (i.e., re-start) your monthly subscription Service in the following Major League Baseball season.  
     
9. **Notifications and Other Terms and Conditions**  
    By purchasing or using any Services, you agree that MLB may notify you about changes to prices and/or Services by sending an email to an address you have provided to MLB or by publishing a notice on the informational page(s) of the MLB Digital Properties applicable to the Services. It is your responsibility to notify MLB of any change in your email address by logging in to the applicable MLB Digital Property and using the online account management tool. If your email service includes functionality or software that catalogues your emails in an automated manner, it is your responsibility to ensure you retrieve those emails we send to you, e.g., by routinely monitoring your bulk, junk and/or spam email folders or by adding us to your address book or safe senders list.  
      
    Programming, pricing, terms and conditions of Services, Tickets and other products offered via the MLB Digital Properties are subject to availability and change.

11\. DISPUTE RESOLUTION (INCLUDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT; CLASS ACTION WAIVER; JURY TRIAL WAIVER)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Please read this section carefully. It affects your legal rights. It provides for resolution of most, but not all, disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement or your use of any MLB Digital Property between you and MLB through individual binding arbitration instead of in court. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court, uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and discovery and appellate review are more limited. This section also contains a jury trial waiver and a waiver of any and all rights to proceed in a class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general or representative action in arbitration or litigation to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. This section survives termination of the Agreement and the relationship between you and MLB. For purposes of this Section 11, and unless stated otherwise, all references to "MLB" incorporate and apply to any "MLB Entity" as defined in Section 9.**

### ARBITRATION (the "arbitration agreement")

1. **Binding Arbitration.** Any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or your use of any MLB Digital Property (including all commercial transactions conducted through the MLB Digital Properties), whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, common law, or any other legal theory, ("Dispute") will be resolved through binding individual arbitration, except for claims identified as Non-Arbitrable Claims below, or those filed in a small claims court that proceed on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. Whether a Dispute is within the jurisdictional limits of small claims court is for a small claims court to decide in the first instance and for a court of competent jurisdiction to otherwise decide.  
      
    Dispute **shall include**: (i) any dispute or claim that arose before the existence of this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising); (ii) any dispute or claim that is currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class; and (iii) any dispute or claim that may arise after termination of this Agreement.  
      
    Dispute, however, **does not include** any dispute or claim related to trademark or copyright infringement or any dispute or claim related to the alleged violation of your privacy rights or interests whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, common law, rule, regulation, or any other legal theory, including but not limited to: (i) claims under the Video Privacy Protection Act and corresponding state video privacy laws; (ii) claims under the Federal Wiretap Act and other federal and state wiretapping laws; or (iii) any other alleged violation of your privacy rights or interests that is based on the use of technology, including, but not limited to, any code, software, software development kit, and/or application programming interface, on any MLB Digital Property or use of that technology to allegedly intercept, record, collect, possess, procure, or disclose any information, including but not limited to personally identifiable information and video viewing behavior (without concession that any such claims, including those under video privacy or wiretapping laws, apply to any MLB Entity) (collectively, "Non-Arbitrable Claims"). You understand and agree that Non-Arbitrable Claims may only be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with the remainder of this Agreement.  
      
    The arbitrator shall decide all issues **except** the following (which are for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide): (i) issues that are reserved for a court in this Agreement; (ii) issues that relate to the scope, validity, and enforceability of the arbitration agreement, class action waiver, or any of the provisions of this Dispute Resolution section; and (iii) issues that relate to arbitrability.  
      
    This Agreement and this arbitration agreement do not prevent you from bringing a Dispute or Non-Arbitrable Claim to the attention of any government agency. You and MLB agree that this Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce and that this arbitration agreement will be interpreted and enforced in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law (and not state arbitration law).
2. **Required Informal Resolution Process.** You and MLB agree to work together in an effort to informally resolve any Dispute or Non-Arbitrable Claim between us.  
      
    The party raising the Dispute or Non-Arbitrable Claim must send the other a written notice within one year of the Dispute or Non-Arbitrable Claim arising that includes all of this information: (i) information sufficient to identify any transaction and account at issue; (ii) contact information (including name, address, telephone number, and email address); and (iii) a detailed description of the nature and basis of the Dispute or Non-Arbitrable Claim and the relief sought, including a calculation for it. The notice must be personally signed by the party raising the Dispute or Non-Arbitrable Claim (and their counsel, if represented). If you are the initiating party, you must send this notice to MLB Advanced Media, L.P., Attn: General Counsel, 1271 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10020. If MLB is the initiating party, we will send this notice to the most recent contact information we have for you.  
      
    For a period of 60 days from receipt of a completed notice (which can be extended by agreement of the parties), you and we agree that the parties (and their counsel) will negotiate in good faith in an effort to informally resolve the Dispute or Non-Arbitrable Claim. The party receiving the notice may request a telephone settlement conference to aid in resolution. If such a conference is requested, you and an MLB representative will personally attend (with counsel, if represented). The conference will be scheduled for a mutually convenient time, which may be outside of the 60-day period.  
      
    Completion of this Required Informal Resolution Process ("Process") is a condition precedent to initiating a claim in arbitration or in litigation. If the sufficiency of a notice or compliance with this Process is at issue, such issue may be raised with and decided by a court of competent jurisdiction at either party's election, and no Dispute shall be filed with any court or arbitration tribunal prior to the resolution of the contested issue regarding the Process. The court shall have the authority to enforce this condition precedent to arbitration of any Dispute or litigation of any Non-Arbitrable Claim, which includes the power to enjoin the filing or prosecution of arbitrations and the assessment or collection of arbitration fees. Nothing in this paragraph limits the right of a party to seek damages for non-compliance with this Process in connection with any Dispute in arbitration.  
      
    All applicable limitations periods (including statutes of limitations) will be tolled from the date of receipt of a completed notice through the conclusion of this Process (a period of 60 days from receipt of a completed notice or until such time as agreed upon by the parties). You or we may commence arbitration if the Dispute is not resolved through this Process, or litigation in a court of competent jurisdiction if the Non-Arbitrable Claim is not resolved through this Process, consistent with the remainder of this Agreement.
3. **Arbitration Procedures.** The arbitration of any Dispute shall be administered by and conducted in accordance with the applicable rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules (where appropriate) ("AAA Rules"), as modified by this arbitration agreement. The AAA Rules are available online at [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/)_www.adr.org_.  
      
    An arbitration demand must be accompanied by a certification of compliance with the Process and be personally signed by the party initiating arbitration (and counsel, if represented). If you are submitting an arbitration demand, you shall send it to MLB Advanced Media, L.P., Attn: General Counsel, 1271 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10020 and follow the AAA Rules for initiating arbitration. If MLB is submitting an arbitration demand, we shall send it to the American Arbitration Association – Case Filing Services, 101 Laurel Oak Road, Suite 100, Voorhees, NJ 08043 and follow the AAA Rules for initiating arbitration.  
      
    By signing the demand for arbitration, a party (and their counsel, if represented) certifies that they have complied with (i) the Required Informal Dispute-Resolution Process in Section 11.2 and (ii) all of the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), including that the claims and relief sought are neither frivolous nor brought for an improper purpose. The arbitrator is authorized to award any relief or impose any sanctions available under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 or applicable federal or state law against all appropriate persons (including counsel) as a court would.  
      
    Any in-person hearing will be held in New York County, New York, or at a location that is reasonably convenient to both parties. An arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available in a court, including injunctive or declaratory relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you and MLB agree that each may bring claims against the other only in your or our individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding. An arbitrator must follow and enforce this Agreement as a court would. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, any of these prohibitions on non-individualized injunctive or declaratory relief and class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceedings are found to be unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), then such a claim or request for relief will be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction, after all other claims and requests for relief are arbitrated. The arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain essential findings and conclusions. Judgment on any arbitration award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. An award shall have no preclusive effect in any other arbitration or proceeding in which you are not a named party.
4. **Costs of Arbitration/Fees.**
    1. Payment of arbitration fees will be governed by the AAA Rules and fee schedule. You and MLB agree that the parties have a shared interest in reducing the costs and increasing the efficiencies associated with arbitration. Therefore, you or we may elect to engage with the AAA regarding arbitration fees, and you and we agree that the parties (and counsel, if represented) will work together in good faith to ensure that arbitration remains cost-effective for all parties.
    2. In the event that either party initiates a proceeding involving any Dispute other than in accordance with this Section 11, or initiates a proceeding involving a Dispute or Non-Arbitrable Claim other than in the Forum as applied in Section 12, the other party shall recover all attorneys' fees and expenses reasonably incurred in enforcing this arbitration agreement and the Forum to which the parties have herein agreed.
5. **Additional Procedures for Mass Arbitration.** You and MLB agree that these Additional Procedures for Mass Arbitration (in addition to the other provisions of this arbitration agreement) shall apply if you choose to participate in a Mass Arbitration. If 25 or more similar Disputes (including yours) are asserted against MLB by the same or coordinated counsel or are otherwise coordinated ("Mass Arbitration"), you understand and agree that the resolution of your Dispute might be delayed and ultimately proceed in court. The parties agree that as part of these procedures, their counsel shall meet and confer in good faith in an effort to resolve the Disputes, streamline procedures, address the exchange of information, modify the number of Disputes to be adjudicated, and conserve the parties' and the AAA's resources. If your Dispute is part of a Mass Arbitration, any applicable limitations periods (including statutes of limitations) shall be tolled from the time that your Dispute is first submitted to the AAA until your Dispute is selected to proceed as part of a staged process or is settled, withdrawn, otherwise resolved, or opted out of arbitration pursuant to this provision.
    1. STAGE ONE: If at least 100 Disputes are submitted as part of the Mass Arbitration, counsel for the claimants and counsel for MLB shall each select 50 Disputes to be filed and to proceed as cases in individual arbitrations as part of this initial staged process. The number of Disputes to be selected to proceed in Stage One can be increased by agreement of counsel for the parties (and if there are fewer than 100 Disputes, all shall proceed individually in Stage One). Each of the 100 (or fewer) cases shall be assigned to a different arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise. If a Claimant withdraws his or her Claim before the issuance of an arbitration award, another Claimant shall be selected by MLB to proceed as part of Stage One. The remaining Disputes shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed or collected in connection with those claims. After this initial set of proceedings, counsel for the parties shall participate in a global mediation session with a former federal or state court judge jointly selected by counsel in an effort to resolve the remaining Disputes (as informed by the adjudications of cases in Stage One).
    2. STAGE TWO: If the remaining Disputes have not been resolved at the conclusion of Stage One, counsel for the claimants and counsel for MLB shall each select 50 Disputes per side to be filed and to proceed as cases in individual arbitrations as part of a second staged process. The number of Disputes to be selected to proceed as part of this second staged process can be increased by agreement of counsel for the parties (and if there are fewer than 100 Disputes remaining, all shall proceed individually in Stage Two). Each side may seek to replace up to ten (10) arbitrators with new arbitrators, and up to five (5) Disputes may be assigned to a single arbitrator to proceed individually unless the parties agree otherwise. If a Claimant withdraws his or her Claim before the issuance of an arbitration award, another Claimant shall be selected by MLB to proceed as part of Stage Two. The remaining Disputes shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed or collected in connection with those claims. After this second set of staged proceedings, the parties shall engage in a global mediation session of all remaining Disputes with a former federal or state court judge jointly selected by counsel in an effort to resolve the remaining Disputes (as informed by the adjudications of cases in Stages One and Two).
    3. If the remaining Disputes are not resolved after completing Stage Two, you and MLB may, separately or by agreement, opt out of arbitration and elect to have your claim heard in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with this Agreement. You also may individually opt out of arbitration by providing your individual, personally signed notice of your intention to opt out to MLB via email to [legaldepartment@mlb.com](mailto:legaldepartment@mlb.com) within thirty (30) days after the conclusion of the second global mediation session. MLB may opt your Dispute out of arbitration by sending an individual, personally signed notice of its intention to opt out to you or your counsel via email within fifteen (15) days following the conclusion of your thirty (30) day opt-out period.
    4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, counsel for the parties may mutually agree in writing to proceed with the adjudication of some or all of the remaining Disputes in individual arbitrations consistent with the process set forth in Stage Two (except Disputes shall be randomly selected and mediation shall be elective by agreement of counsel) or through another mutually-agreeable process.
    5. A court of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority to enforce the Additional Procedures for Mass Arbitration, including the power to enjoin the filing or prosecution of arbitrations and the assessment or collection of arbitration fees. The Additional Procedures for Mass Arbitration provision and each of its requirements are essential parts of this arbitration agreement. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, a court of competent jurisdiction decides that the Additional Procedures for Mass Arbitration apply to your Dispute and are not enforceable, then your Dispute shall not proceed in arbitration and shall only proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with the remainder of the Agreement.

### Class Action Waiver

YOU AND MLB AGREE THAT ANY PROCEEDING, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR IN LITIGATION, WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, CONSOLIDATED, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. YOU AND MLB AGREE TO WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO BRING OR TO PARTICIPATE IN SUCH AN ACTION IN ARBITRATION OR IN COURT TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE PARTIES RETAIN THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS-WIDE SETTLEMENT.

### Jury Trial Waiver

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND MLB WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.
