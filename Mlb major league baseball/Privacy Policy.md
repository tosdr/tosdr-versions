3\. Other Information Collected
-------------------------------

**Technical Information.** When you use the MLB Properties, we use software tools, including but not limited to cookies (small amounts of data which include a unique string of characters sent to your browser or application from a website’s computers and stored on your computer’s or device’s hard drive), web beacons (technology used to track activity, also known as pixel tags) and similar technologies, to collect a variety of information, for example the IP address of the computer or device used to access an MLB Property, the type of Internet browser or operating system used to access an MLB Property, the date and duration of a Website visit or the IP address used to access the Website. We use such technical information for internal purposes, for example to study and improve the response times of our Website. We may associate such technical information with personal information you provide to us as described in Section 1 above, in which case we will treat such associated information as personal information. Please be advised that associating technical information with personal information may be required for us, and our Service Providers, to recognize you and your communications with us, for example to retain your newsletter preferences or enable your use of a “shopping cart.” Customers within the EEA will be asked for consent prior to the setting of cookies.

**Location Data.** When you use an MLB Property via a wireless device we may solicit your permission to collect your location data. Some features within our Applications (e.g., live Major League/Minor League Baseball game video or location-based offers) may only function upon confirmation of your location, and therefore such features will not be available if you choose not to provide your location data to us. The specificity of the location data collected may depend on a number of factors, including the device you are using (e.g., laptop, smartphone, tablet) and how you are connected to the Internet (e.g., via cable broadband connection, Wi-Fi). If you enable location services for our Applications, we may collect location data (e.g., zip code) periodically as you use or leave open our Applications. We use such location information for internal purposes and to improve your MLB Property experience, for example to understand where our users are most successfully accessing the MLB Properties. We may associate such location information with personal information you provide to us as described in Section 1 above, in which case we will treat such associated information as personal information. Depending on the platform you use to access our Applications (e.g., Apple’s iOS, Google’s Android) you may be able to control whether location data is collected from within “Settings” or other controls on your wireless device or the Applications.

**Our Access to Your Contacts.** When you use our Games, we may solicit your permission to access your contacts list (e.g., address book) so you can be matched with individuals from your contacts list who participate in our Games and you can invite your friends to play. We will not store the information in your contacts list except to manage your Game invitations.

**Other Companies’ Cookies and Web Beacons; Network Advertisers; Targeted Advertising.** We allow and use select Service Providers and/or Other Companies that may act as third parties as defined under applicable data privacy laws, such as those who deliver advertisements, content, or social networking or which provide other services associated with the MLB Properties, to collect data and/or serve ads when you visit MLB Properties. We may also make available certain data you have given to us (e.g., IP address) or that we have collected through publicly available means to third parties engaged in targeting advertisements on the MLB Properties including for use in accordance with such third party's privacy policy. Network advertisers may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to MLB Properties in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. This may happen through permission given to such third parties to set cookies, web beacons or similar technologies in certain locations within the MLB Properties, including but not limited to certain of our emails. Third party companies that manage and deliver advertisements to websites and applications such as ours are commonly referred to as "network advertisers." A permitted network advertiser may use cookies, web beacons or similar technologies to collect information about your interaction with the MLB Properties in order to tailor certain advertisements and content delivered within the MLB Properties and on other websites within such network advertiser's ad network. These companies may also use non-cookie technologies to recognize your computer or device and/or to collect and record information about your web surfing activity including your activities on or off MLB Properties. Please keep in mind that your web browser may not permit you to block the use of these non-cookie technologies, and those browser settings that block cookies may have no effect on such techniques. You may learn more about network advertising industry practices and opt out of targeted behavioral advertising from many major third party network advertisers and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies via the information and tools available [here](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) and [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/)at _http://www.aboutads.info/choices/_ and _http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/_.

To facilitate the activity described above and below, we use a Service Providers to convert your email address into a unique code (hashed email address or telephone number), which is then provided to the advertiser, Other Companies, including Other Companies that may act as third parties as defined under applicable data privacy laws, and/or Service Providers as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

**Other Advertising.** We disclose certain data to Social Networks (as defined below) such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Snapchat to allow us to target existing users and customers with highly relevant advertising campaigns. We will not share your name, address, email address or telephone number for the purposes of such campaigns. Instead, a unique code (hashed email address) is disclosed to the applicable Social Network in order for that identifier to be matched against existing users of the relevant Social Network and to identify potentially relevant audiences for targeted advertising. We use services such as LinkedIn Matched Audiences and Facebook Custom Audiences for these purposes. If you do not wish to receive advertisements in this way, please follow the links in the paragraph above.

In addition to advertisements for our own goods and services, we may also facilitate Other Companies, including Other Companies that may act as third parties as defined under applicable data privacy laws, to advertise their own and/or Other Companies’ goods and services including by targeting those advertisements to those that might be most interested in them. These advertisements may be shown within our Games. This is done using information which does not include your name, address, email address or telephone number and we will not share or sell any of your personal information to third party advertisers other than as set forth in this Privacy Policy. In order to provide advertisements relevant to you, your IP address will be used, as well as your operating system and device type. Information about your particular device will be used to show you advertisements which work properly on that device.

**Social Networking.** When using the MLB Properties or when using certain Other Companies’ social networking services (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Google +) (each a “Social Network”), you may have the option to connect your MLB Property information and activity with your Social Network information and activity. If you authorize such a connection, you permit us to disclose, share and/or publish information about your MLB Property activity with that Social Network and its users, and to access certain of your Social Network information, as disclosed to you at the time you consent to the connection. Information we may share with a Social Network may include, but is not limited to, technical information about your MLB Property activity, your MLB Property comments or the videos you watch on MLB Properties. Information we may access about you, with your consent, from a Social Network may include, but is not limited to, your basic Social Network information, your location data, your list of contacts, friends or followers and certain information about your activities on the Social Network. If you permit a connection between a Social Network and an MLB Property, we (and that Social Network) may be able to identify you and to associate information received pursuant to the connection with information we already have about you. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the Privacy Policy and privacy control options of any Social Network with which you choose to disclose information or connect to an MLB Property.

**Device ID.** When you use certain MLB Properties, we or our Service Provider may collect your unique Device ID. We may use such information for internal purposes and to provide you a better MLB Property experience, for example to troubleshoot Application problems you may experience or provide you rewards or offers in connection with your Game activity. We may associate Device ID with personal information you provide to us as described in Section 1 above, in which case we will treat such associated information as personal information. You may learn more about our Service Provider for Mobile Games and opt out of any anonymous Device ID collection via the privacy settings available within your mobile device.

**AR Data.** If you authorize Apple’s TrueDepth Camera in connection with your use of the MLB Properties, we will capture information regarding that use and we may use and disclose such information as set forth in this Privacy Policy, as disclosed when you first authorize use of Apple’s TrueDepth Camera or as otherwise permissible under applicable law. Information from Apple’s TrueDepth camera is used in real time—we do not store this information on our servers or disclose it to Other Companies.

Furthermore, at certain games or events operated by MLB, an MLB Club, an MiLB Club, or any MLB Entity, consent may be separately sought for the capture and use of video or audiovisual content for purposes set forth in that consent. This video or audiovisual content may be utilized by MLB, an MLB Club, an MiLB Club, or an MLB Entity pursuant to this Privacy Policy to produce, exhibit, advertise or otherwise use your image, voice or likeness in any and all media now or existing in future as part of the MLB Entities’ commercial, advertising and marketing activities.

As there is no industry standard, please note that we do not alter our Website’s data and information collection and use practices when we receive a “Do Not Track” signal from your browser.

### O. Loyalty Program Disclosures

If you are a resident of California or Colorado and you participate in a loyalty, rewards, premium feature, discount, or club card program established by an MLB Entity for the purpose of providing discounts, rewards, or other value to you in connection with your participation (each, if any, a “Loyalty Program”), we may disclose and/or share your personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy and/or pursuant to any separate consent you may provide in connection with your participation in the Loyalty Program. You may cease your participation in any Loyalty Program at any time by following the instructions provided in connection with the Loyalty Program or by contacting 866-800-1275.

### P. Notice to Illinois Residents

If you are a resident of Illinois and you elect to participate in any program or offering requiring you to provide biometric information to any MLB Entity or its Service Provider(s), MLB will permanently destroy such biometric information, and any information directly derived from such biometric information, when the initial purpose for collecting or obtaining such information has been satisfied or within three (3) years following your last interaction with us, whichever occurs first.

* **No Spyware or Adware**. We do not install any Spyware or Adware in connection with the MLB Properties, or distribute any commercial message, or authorize any third party to distribute any commercial message, by means of Spyware or Adware. "Spyware" or "Adware" is any software which has been downloaded to or installed on an Internet user's computer or device, without the user's actual consent, and facilitates the distribution of any commercial message to the user. If you feel you may have Spyware from another company installed on your machine, there are various anti-Spyware/Adware software applications available on the Internet to identify if this has occurred.
* **Our Security Practices**. The account information associated with the MLB Properties is password protected for your privacy and security. You choose your password for the MLB Properties so the strength of that password is determined by you. We recommend that you choose a unique password and not share your password with anyone else. In certain areas, we use industry-standard SSL encryption to protect data transmissions.
* **Links**. The MLB Properties contain links to other websites and products produced by MLB and to websites and products operated by unrelated Other Companies. In addition, if you click on an advertisement within the MLB Properties, you may be directed to a web page within the MLB Properties or to a third party website or product. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of third party websites or products, and we encourage you to read the privacy policies of every website and product that collects personally identifiable information from you. This Privacy Policy applies only to the MLB Properties, unless you are notified otherwise upon accessing any third party website or product, in which case the terms and conditions set forth in such notification will apply.
* Your Nevada Privacy Rights. If you are a resident of Nevada, in accordance with Nevada Revised Statutes Chapter 603A, you may request that we do not sell certain of your personally identifiable information (your "Covered Information" as defined in NRS Chapter 603A) by sending a request to [dataprivacy@mlb.com](mailto:dataprivacy@mlb.com).
* **Special Rules For Children**. Because of federal law, we are not permitted to knowingly collect any personal information from a child under the age of thirteen without the consent of that child's parent or guardian. The statements in this Privacy Policy about our collection and use of personal information also apply to our treatment of personal information from children under the age of thirteen. Some elements of the MLB Properties (e.g., shop, ticketing, and auctions) require the submission of a payment card number along with personal information in connection with a purchase; other elements of the MLB Properties (e.g., fantasy baseball) require the submission of personal information to access or use the MLB Properties. Except in certain cases where limited contact information may be collected and not retained, these elements of the MLB Properties are not available to children under the age of thirteen. If a child who we know to be under the age of thirteen and for whom we have not received parental consent attempts to utilize a service on the MLB Properties which is not available to children, he/she will not be able to access it and may receive a message which relays that he/she is not eligible for such feature. For children located in jurisdictions within the EU or EEA, where this Privacy Policy refers to consent, this will require the consent of a parent or legal guardian in relation to any person under the age specified by the law applicable to the location of the child in question.
