Privacy Policy
==============

One of the goals of LibreWolf is to remove the data collection and telemetry from Firefox, and thus we don't collect any data from the user in the LibreWolf browser or on the LibreWolf website.

We can't always assure that no data is sent from the browser to Mozilla or other third parties, but we try our best to achieve that. For that case, also check out the [Firefox Privacy Notice](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/firefox/).
