Vanguard also may subcontract the processing of your information to, or otherwise share your information with, other third parties in the United States or countries other than your country of residence. As a result, where the Personal and Other Data that we collect is transferred to and processed in the United States or anywhere else outside the European Economic Area (EEA) for the purposes described above, we will take steps to ensure that the Data receives the same level of protection as if it remained within the UK and the EEA, including entering into data transfer agreements, or using approved standard contractual clauses.

---------------------

Vanguard relies on the accuracy of the information provided by its clients and others.

------------------------------------

We use commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your Personal Data from loss, misuse, and unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction in accordance with applicable law. Please be aware that despite our best efforts, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security all of the time. If you have online account access, we recommend that you take steps to protect against unauthorised access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your username and password private. For additional information, see our [Online Security Policy](https://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk/terms-conditions "Online Security Policy").

Vanguard retains Personal Data for as long as necessary to provide our services to you, to fulfil the purposes described in this Policy and/or our business purposes, or as required by law, regulation, or internal policy.

Fraud prevention agencies can hold your Personal Data for different periods of time, and if you are considered to pose a fraud or money laundering risk, your Personal Data can be held for up to six years. A record of any fraud or money laundering risk will be retained by the fraud prevention agencies, and may result in others refusing to provide services, financing, or employment to you. If you have any questions about this, please contact us using the details below.
