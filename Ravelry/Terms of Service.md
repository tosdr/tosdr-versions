    Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that augment or enhance the current Services, shall be subject to the Terms. You understand and agree that the Service is provided “AS-IS” and that the Company assumes no responsibility for the timeliness, deletion, misdelivery or failure to store any user communications or personalization settings. You are responsible for obtaining access to the Service, and that access may involve third-party fees (such as Internet service provider or airtime charges). In addition, you must provide and are responsible for all equipment necessary to access the Service.

    By registering, you represent that you have all requisite right, power and authority to bind yourself to any applicable agreement(s) and to perform your obligations thereunder. If you are acting on behalf of a company, you represent that you are authorized to bind your company. You agree to provide accurate and complete information, and to update such information as necessary to keep it up-to-date and accurate. The Company reserves the right to review all registration applications, and to accept or reject any applicant(s) in its sole judgment. You may not transfer or assign your registration to any other party.

    You are solely responsible for any Content posted by you on the Site or offered by you through a Service, including, without limitation, for any errors or omissions in any Content, or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content posted, emailed, transmitted, or otherwise made available via the Services. You represent that you have the right to post or transmit such Content, and, by posting or transmitting such Content, you give the Company a license to publish and distribute such Content though the Services and to incorporate such Content into other works in any format or medium now known or later developed.  You are solely responsible for protecting and enforcing any intellectual property and other rights in your Content; the Company shall have no obligation to do so on your behalf. 
    
    Content presented to you as part of the Services, including but not limited to advertisements in the Services and sponsored Content within the Services may be protected by intellectual property rights which are owned by the sponsors or advertisers who provide that Content through the Services (or by other persons or companies on their behalf). You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on such Content that you do not own unless you have been explicitly granted a license to do so by the owner of that Content, in a separate agreement. 
    
    You understand that by using the Services you may be exposed to Content that you may find offensive, indecent or objectionable and that, in this respect, you use the Services at your own risk.  The Company shall have the right, but not the obligation, to remove any Content that is violative of any law, regulation or guideline, or that it deems offensive, in its sole discretion.
    
    With respect to any Content that you have submitted to the Site, you have the right to request the Company remove such Content, thus revoking any rights the Company has with respect to such Content. Requests of this kind are to be submitted to [legal@ravelry.com](mailto:legal@ravelry.com).
    
5. **Pattern Listing Service**. Among the Services offered is a pattern listing service. If you chose to take advantage of this Service, (1) you represent and warrant that you hold the copyright and other necessary intellectual property rights in any and all the pattern(s) that you list and advertise on the Site, and (2) you grant to the Company a non-exclusive, revocable license to list and advertise the pattern and its associated information, including photographs, data, images, and thumbnails on the Site. Notwithstanding anything in these Terms to the contrary, you have the right to remove any pattern that you have listed at any time, and, by so doing, you shall revoke the license to the Company from that point forward. Additionally, the Company will not use any pattern(s), or its/their associated information without the express written permission of the designer or owner of the pattern, other than to list and advertise the pattern(s) in connection with the Services.
    
    You are solely responsible for any patterns posted by you on the Site or offered by you through a Service, including, without limitation, for any errors or omissions in any pattern(s), or any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any pattern(s) posted, emailed, transmitted, or otherwise made available via the Services. You are solely responsible for protecting and enforcing any intellectual property and other rights in your pattern(s); the Company shall have no obligation to do so on your behalf. 
    
    The sale of a pattern is a transaction between the seller and the buyer. The Company is not a party to any such sale. However, if you sell a pattern through one or more of the Services, you agree to grant the buyer, at a minimum, a non-commercial, perpetual license for personal use of the pattern. Subject to the foregoing, you may include additional terms with respect to a pattern, such as, but without limitation, rights to modify the pattern, sell the pattern and/or items created from the pattern, and/or explicit restrictions with respect to the use of the pattern or items created therefrom, provided that such restrictions do not prevent the buyer from using the pattern to create items for personal use.. Any such terms shall be included at your discretion, and shall be between you and the purchaser.
    
    You understand that a purchaser of a downloadable .pdf of your pattern may store the pattern in the Site storage service (the “Library”) and the purchaser will have the right to access such pattern on the Site until they either delete the pattern from the Library or cease being a User of the Site.
    
    Without limitation, the Company is not responsible for any patterns posted by Users of the Site. The Company makes no representations with respect to the accuracy, integrity, or quality of any patterns, and shall not in any way be liable for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any patterns posted, emailed, transmitted or otherwise made available via the Services.
    
    Any pattern presented to you as part of the Services may be protected by intellectual property rights held by the owner of the pattern. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create derivative works based on any pattern that you do not own unless you have been explicitly granted a license to do so by the owner of that pattern, in a separate agreement. 
    
    You understand that by using the Services you may be exposed to patterns that you may find offensive, indecent or objectionable and that, in this respect, you use the Services at your own risk. 
    
    The Company shall have the right, but not the obligation, to remove any pattern that is violative of any law, regulation or guideline, or that it deems offensive, in its sole discretion.
    
6. **Dealings with Advertisers and/or Other Users**. You may be exposed to advertising on the Site or through a Service or related communication from the Company. The Company may also provide one or more Services through which users can transact with one another. Other than as explicitly set forth in a particular agreement or governing guideline, your correspondence or business dealings with, or participation in promotions of, advertisers or other users found on or through a Service, including payment and delivery of related goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such other party. You agree that the Company shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings or as the result of the presence of such advertisers or other users on the Site or Service.
    
    BECAUSE THE COMPANY IS NOT INVOLVED IN TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN YOU AND ANY ADVERTISER OR OTHER USER, IF A DISPUTE ARISES BETWEEN YOU AND AN ADVERTISER OR OTHER USER, EACH OF YOU RELEASE THE COMPANY (AND ITS AGENTS AND EMPLOYEES) FROM CLAIMS, DEMANDS, AND DAMAGES (ACTUAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL) OF EVERY KIND AND NATURE, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, SUSPECTED AND UNSUSPECTED, DISCLOSED AND UNDISCLOSED, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH SUCH DISPUTES.
