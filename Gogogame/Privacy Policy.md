Your data is protected against unauthorized access and loss through the use of various electronic, technical, physical, administrative and contractual measures. Gogogame has taken the necessary technical and organizational precautions to ensure that the regulations for data privacy are respected both internally as well as by external service providers.

  

**Collection of data**

Gogogame collects personal data provided by you upon registration at one of our websites or for one of our games;

● when these are provided by you during an inquiry;

● when these are provided by you for the use and payment of fee-based goods and services;

● at your request for the purpose of participating in promotions and surveys, or to receive newsletters.

  

Gogogame also collects user data to the extent that it is necessary for the performance of services or for the billing of these services. This refers in particular to game processes, game scores and information regarding the use and settlement of services. Within the context of the use of our websites, forums and games, Gogogame collects the following non-personal information:

● IP addresses including time and date

● cookies,  local flash data

● statistical information such as the browser type, operating system, redirecting URL, date, time, pages used, total time of use, frequency of use. This data is used in statistical analyses for anonymous data records.

IP addresses and the corresponding Internet information are saved for a period of maximum of six months within the scope of our legal obligations regarding data storage. Furthermore, these are stored to secure data and ensure our system’s stability and reliability. In specific situations, Gogogame may also use your IP address and the corresponding Internet information to track and stop use of multiple accounts for fraudulent purposes. In cases such as these, Gogogame will seek the consent for such use within the framework of the relevant game conditions.

  

**How we use your information**

Our objective in storing and collecting your information is to provide players with a better gaming experience to the players by allowing us:

• to operate, improve and optimize our Services, Websites and our players’ experiences;   
• to create your game accounts and allow you to play our games;   
• to identify and suggest connections with other players and personalize our Services to you;   
• to enable players to communicate with each other;   
• to provide technical support and respond to player inquiries;   
• to help prevent fraud or potentially illegal activities, and enforcing our Terms of Services;   
• to manage and deliver contextual and behavioral advertising;   
• to notify players of in-game updates, new products or promotional offers;   
• to administer rewards, surveys, sweepstakes, contests, or other promotional activities or events sponsored or managed by us or our business partners;   
• to comply with our legal obligations, resolve any disputes we may have with you or other players, and to enforce our agreements with third parties; and   
• to conduct research.

We may send you promotional information to the email address you provided us. If you have left your mobile numbers or identifiers of your communication device, we may send some promotional information to the mobile phone or other communication device.

To complete purchase transactions, our third-party payment processors may collect payment information from you, including your postal address, e-mail address and financial information (i.e. card number, passwords). We will not store your financial information, but we may get some non-financial information to complete the purchase, i.e. your name, billing address and the items purchased in order to fulfill your order (Non-financial Information). If you conduct the transaction on a third party platform, the Non-financial Information may also be collected by us to complete the purchase, you need to read the privacy policy of such third party carefully because your payment through such third party may be governed by such policies.

● to provide our services and settle payments;

● to anonymously or pseudonymously adjust our offer to meet our users’ demands and improve our services;

● to fulfill legal obligations, and in particular, to meet the requirements for preserving data.

**Offer Walls:** Gogogame games or their purchase pages may display an “offer wall” that may be hosted by a third party offer wall provider. The offer wall allows third party advertisers to provide virtual currency to users in exchange for interacting with an advertisement or for completing a marketing offer that may include signing up for an account with one of those advertisers. These offers are not controlled by or made by Gogogame. These offers may be displayed to you based on certain technical information, such as your geographic area or anonymous demographic information. After clicking on one of these advertisements, you will no longer be on a site hosted by Gogogame or a partnering Third Party Platform. To properly credit user accounts and to prevent fraud, a unique identifier will be shared with the offer wall provider. This identifier is used to ensure proper crediting of your account, prevent fraud or duplicate offers and to resolve any customer service inquiries that may arise. Once you complete an offer, you may then be returned to a Gogogame Website or Service.
