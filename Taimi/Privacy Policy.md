Taimi Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) explains all the privacy matters you may face when using our website, [https://taimi.com](https://taimi.com/) and other websites run by Taimi (the “Website”) and Taimi’s mobile (the “App”), jointly the “Service”, operated by Social Impact Inc. (“Taimi” or “we”). 

This Policy is an integral part of the [Taimi’s Terms of Service](https://taimi.com/terms) (the “Terms”) and incorporated by reference into them. Please read this Policy carefully and if you have any questions, feel free to contact us at [legal@taimi.com](mailto:legal@taimi.com). In case you have any ongoing questions about how to exercise your rights, etc., you may also contact us at [support@taimi.com](mailto:support@taimi.com).

Some services which may be employed by either Taimi or you to interact with the Services may have their own privacy rules (third-party privacy policies). Thus, if your personal data is processed by such services, such processing is governed by third-party privacy policies, not this present Policy.

This Privacy Policy explains what personal data is collected when you use the our mobile applications and websites, and the services provided through them, how such personal data will be processed.

By using our service/app, you promise us that (i) you have read, understand and agree to this privacy policy, and (ii) you are over 18 years of age. If you do not agree, or are unable to make this promise, you must not use the app/service. In such case, you must (a) delete your account and contact us and request deletion of your data; (b) cancel any subscriptions using the functionality provided by Apple (if you are using iOS) or Google (if you are using Android), any other app stores that may be available from time to time, or by us.

Any translation from English version is provided for your convenience only. In the event of any difference in meaning or interpretation between the English language version of this Privacy Policy available at [https://taimi.com/privacy-policy](https://taimi.com/privacy-policy) and any translation, the English language version will prevail. The original English text shall be the sole legally binding version.

**1\.   Initial Notice to Users**

**1.1.**   Here, at Taimi, we strive to protect your privacy. It goes without saying, by being a place for building the best connections between people, that the App exists as a vast social network, where users may share their experiences, show emotions and just be themselves. All of those actions are connected to personal data sharing. Your “personal data” or just “data” means any information linked with you or the one that may identify you directly or indirectly as a person.

**1.2.**   **Privacy tips.** Despite our best efforts, we cannot control how other users or third-party services may use your data. When using Taimi, you should presume that everything you post, share or message on the App may be publicly viewable and accessible, both by Taimi users and people outside the App. We want you to be careful about going public with your data, thus, we kindly ask you to follow our privacy recommendations as below:

(a)      when you post information about yourself or use the messaging function, the amount of personal information you share is determined at your own risk.

(b)     you share information with other users when you voluntarily disclose information on the Service (including your Taimi profile). That is why we recommend and encourage you to think carefully about the information you disclose about yourself. Please be careful with your data and make sure that the information you publish is data you feel comfortable being publicly viewable; 

(c)      we do **not** recommend that you put **email addresses, URLs, instant messaging details, phone numbers, full names or addresses, credit card details, national identity numbers, drivers’ license details, precise location and other important data on your Taimi** profile or send that data via direct messages to people that you do not trust;

(d)     we do **not** recommend that you share your sensitive data (religious denomination, sexual preferences, health details, political leanings, any kind of addictions, etc.) with other users. If you really desire to share this data safely (so as to set up more relevant connections, etc.), you may use Taimi tags features. With this regard to Taimi tags, please read section 1.3 hereof to find out the benefits of their use;

(e)     photos that you share via Taimi may reveal much information about you; please inspect all of them for data or objects that you do not want to go public with before you upload or share your photos;

(f)      please make sure you log out of your Taimi profile after use from either your or a third-party’s device since you never know who may get access to them;

(g)     please do not share your access credentials (login, email, password, phone number, etc.) to Taimi or other social media profiles with anyone else;

(h)     we recommend that you change your Taimi and other social media password from time to time;

(i)      if you think or even have the slightest suspicion that someone may have had access to your Taimi or social media profile or access credentials, first of all, change them immediately; if you lost your access to the profile owing to third-party activity, we recommend that you contact us at [support@taimi.com](mailto:support@taimi.com) (if there is no access to Taimi profile) or report the issue to the relevant social media platform; 

(j)       we kindly draw your attention to the fact that you are the only person who must care about your access credentials’ safety. Remember that in the event they are compromised, a third party may get your data. We cannot guarantee your data security if you lose control of your account and do not notify Taimi about the issue.

**1.3.  Taimi tags and Information filled by you, including sensitive data and location.** Instead of sharing some of your data in a text description of your profile, we recommend that you use Taimi tags to identify you as a person of a specific style. We find it a more secure and beneficial option since you may change them or hide them anytime you choose. Meanwhile, Taimi tags allow you to create better connections with people who may share your views and are more likely to say “hello”. 

Taimi allows you to share information about yourself with, including your location and information that may be deemed "sensitive" or "special category" in certain jurisdictions such as sexual orientation and data concerning a natural person’s sex life. Such information will be collected by Taimi and puclibly available in your profile only after your explicit consent.  If you do not give your explicit consent to process sexual orientation and data concerning a natural person’s sex life, we will not be able to connect you with other users. Still, at any time, you are entitled to revoke your explicit consent or request the deletion of your sensitive data or other data by contacting at [support@taimi.com](mailto:support@taimi.com).

Taimi also collects your location to determine your distance from other users ("Distance Information"). Taimi app is designed to allow users to share Distance Information. Your Distance Information will be displayed in your profile in those users' search results should you elect to display your relative distance. Note that if you choose not to allow Taimi to access your location certain features of the Taimi app will not function properly. Sophisticated users who use the Taimi app  in an unauthorized manner, or other users who change their location while you remain in the same location, may use Distance Information to determine your exact location.

If you have given Taimi access to your location, but wish to turn this off, you can do so by the following methods: 

iPhone app — settings, privacy, location services, Taimi

Android — settings, location, Taimi, permissions, location

  

**2\.**   **Changes and Updates to Policy**

**2.2.**   **Communication on Updates**. If we make any changes hereto that, in our sole discretion, are substantial, we will notify you by email (to the address associated with your profile) or via the App, post a notice within Taimi Services or make a notification appear in your profile when you next log in to Taimi before amendments become effective.

**5.5.**   **Legal Bases**. Legal bases are the grounds set forth by the GDPR on which we may process your data. We rely on the following legal bases:

(a)   performing of the contract with you — the main legal basis that we use to process your data. It includes mostly everything we do to provide you with services, under our [Terms of Service](https://taimi.com/terms) and their appendices. You may restrict us from processing your data, but please be advised that, in such a case, we will not be able to provide services to you. Please see section 8 to find out more;

(b)   legal obligation — we may process your data when we have a legal obligation when it is required by applicable laws, e.g., in order to prevent fraud, assist law protection and enforcement bodies.

(c)   Legitimate interest – we have a commercial interest in processing with your personal data that is justified, balanced and does not infringe on your privacy (e.g., statistical reporting). Where the legal basis is legitimate interests, you have a right to object to our use of your data. Please see section 8 to find out more;

(d)  consent — we may process some of your data when we have your consent to do so. Where the legal basis is consent, you can withdraw consent at any time. Please see section 8 to find out more.

**5.6.**   You hereby acknowledge and agree that we may receive your personal data from any third parties (other users, any official bodies, third-party providers, etc.) when you connect your Taimi profile with other services, when we receive inquiries, court orders, subpoenas, claims, etc 

**5.7.**   We do not collect or store full credit card number information, though we may receive credit card-related information to help process future payments and summary information about transactions that do not include credit card or bank account numbers.

**5.8.**  From time to time we may start surveys/feedbacks for research purposes and we may contact you to find out if you would like to take part. We may also contact you to find out if you would like to take part in marketing campaigns. Such activities are optional. If you do not wish to be contacted to take part in a survey or marketing campaign, please contact us at [support@taimi.com](mailto:support@taimi.com) or via the respective in-App feature. If you do not want to contact us but you also do not want to participate in our activities, please ignore our messages.

**5.9. Behavioral Advertising.** Since we rely on your consent to show you personalized ads, you are entitled to revoke your consent anytime and request that we stop using personalized ads towards you. Please contact us at support@taimi.com to strike off your consent.

Before creating your Taimi account, users in the EEA/UK will be presented with a consent preference screen where they can control if their personal information can be used for advertising by our ad/marketing partners. Users in the EEA/UK can also access the PrivacyPreference Center from within the settings menu of the Taimi app at any time. If you are a California or Virginia resident see section 9.3. and 10.4. on how to opt out of personalized/targeted advertising. 

Meanwhile, if you opt-out of targeted/personalized advertising you will still see ads, but non-personalized advertising.  Such non-personalized advertising may be based on location that is not linked to the identity of the user and  is not classified as personal data itself. 

We may use your device location data for personalized advertising. This data is collected with your explicit consent and shared with third-party ad networks for targeted/personalized advertising purposes. The third parties we work with, their use of location data, and their privacy policy links are listed below:

a. Facebook Inc. (Facebook Audience Network Software Development Kit SDK) ([Privacy Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/)): uses your  location data to enhance ad relevance for you.

b. Snapchat, Inc. ( SCAppAdsKit) ([Privacy Policy](https://values.snap.com/privacy/privacy-policy)): uses your location data to enhance ad relevance for you.

**5.10. Push Notifications**.  We use push notifications to keep you informed about your activity within our Services. These notifications may include reminders, motivational prompts to encourage engagement, or other relevant information. For instance, you might receive a notification informing you of a new message, reaction, or match. To stop receiving push notifications (opt-out), you can adjust the settings on your device.

Users in the EU/UK also have the option to change their privacy settings in Taimi app's Notification settings.

  

**6\.**   **Duration and Location of Processing; Cross-Border Data Transfer**

**6.1.  Data Retention.**  Your data will be stored within the term of your use of the Services and up to the termination of such use (or upon agreement between you and Taimi) which means the deletion, blocking or suspension of your account on the mobile application and the restriction of your further use of the mobile application; we shall terminate the processing of your personal information, unless the special retention period for the storage of such data is set by the relevant legislation at the time. We may also maintain records to prevent fraud and ensure security, for example when user is banned for violating our terms or misusing our services.

**Note, temporary account deactivation, disabling, or “freezing” the app account does NOT qualify as account deletion.  
**

**6.2.**   **Exemptions**. We delete or anonymize your information, including sensitive information indicated in section 9.2. for California Residents, upon the termination of your profile or after two years of your continuous inactivity. There may be special rules applied in case that:

(a)    we must hold your data to comply with applicable laws;

(b)   we must hold your data to evidence our compliance with applicable laws;

(c)    there is an outstanding issue, claim or dispute requiring us to hold the relevant data until it is resolved; or

(d)   your data must be kept for our legitimate business interests, such as fraud prevention and enhancing users’ safety and security (see section 6.7 hereof).

**6.3.**   **Terms of Deletion**. All your data is to be fully erased (or anonymized) within 7 calendar days following deletion of your Taimi profile, except:

(a)    in-app features and subscription purchases which are being retained during the term of your subscription and 5 years from the deletion of your user account;

(b)   messages between users and support team, support tickets, emails with our support team (as identified in your email), as part of support tickets data that are being retained during the term of your subscription and 5 years from the deletion of your user account;

(c)    hashed email address, phone number, IP address, profile ID (including, Taimi ID, Facebook ID, Snapchat ID, Apple ID) and device ID (NOT a device IMEI) associated with banned account which are being retained during the term of your subscription and 5 years from the deletion of your user account owing to our legitimate interest (see section 6.6 hereof).

**6.4.**   **Leftovers.** When your account is deleted (as well as your data) from the Services, copies of your data may still be viewable, if your data has been previously shared with others, or copied or stored by other users or other third parties. We cannot control this, nor do we accept any liability for this. If you have given third party applications or websites access to your data, they may retain such information to the extent permitted under their own privacy policies.

**6.5.**   Removed and deleted data may be hosted in backup copies for up to 30 days, but will not be available to others in the meantime. We put that backup data ‘beyond use’. At the end of this period, these data will be permanently deleted.

**6.6.**   At all times, you are entitled to restrict us from processing your data by sending to us a data erasure request or a notice of prohibition to process your data. Please be warned that: 

(a)    such action prohibits us from processing your data and/or making us delete your data so you will lose your access to the Website and Services;

(b)    if your Taimi profile is banned, a data erasure request will not release you from prohibition to use Taimi Services;

(c)    if your profile is blocked, your other Taimi profiles may also be blocked as part of our anti-spam and anti-fraud procedures.

**6.7.  Enforcing of Prohibition to Use Taimi.** If your profile is blocked, banned or otherwise disabled owing to any violation of applicable law or a violation of the Terms of Use or the provisions of this Policy, you will be prohibited from further creation of new profiles and using the Services again. Accordingly, we will keep on processing data listed in section 6.3(с) hereof (the “technical data”) in order to prevent your further registration and potential violations. Please note that:

(a)   the technical data is not subject to erasing under article 17 of the GDPR; hence, we will process it on the basis of our legitimate interest, which is a separate ground of processing. We may also process some technical data of minor users on the basis of our legitimate interest to protect the security or integrity (as considered in COPPA § 312.4(c)(6)) and prevent such minors from accessing to our Service from other accounts;

(b)  our legitimate interest does not outweigh your right to privacy, because the way that we use the technical data does not significantly impact your privacy, and we have a compelling reason to do so (recital 47 of the GDPR). This reason is to restrict you from breaching yet another obligation under the [Taimi’s Terms of Service](https://taimi.com/terms) and potentially harming us or our users.

 **6.8.**   **Location of Servers.** Our servers are based in the USA and EU, so your data may be processed and hosted outside the EU. We inform you that we use EU servers to collect and process EU and UK residents’ data and we use USA servers to collect and process data of users from the rest of the countries. If you are located outside the United States, your information is collected in your country and then transferred to the United States — or to another country in which we (or our affiliates or service providers) operate.

**6.9.**   **Cross-border Data Transfer.** The sharing of information laid out in section 5.4 hereof involves cross-border data transfers to the United States of America and other jurisdictions that may have different laws about data processing. if we transfer personal data collected within the EEA to countries with not adequate level of data protection, we use one of the following legal bases: (i) Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission (details available [here](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/eu-us-data-transfers_en) (or any new version of contractual clauses issued by a data protection body (if any), or (ii) the European Commission adequacy decisions about certain countries (details available [here](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en)). We take steps to ensure that the recipient is bound by E.U. Standard Contractual Clauses together with additional safeguards to protect your personal data. You can see a copy of these clauses. In certain situations, the courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in those countries might be entitled to access your personal information.

**How to Submit a Request.** To submit a request not to sell or share your personal information or to limit the use of your sensitive information, please contact us by email [support@taimi.com](mailto:support@taimi.com) or by clicking the link [“Your Privacy Choices”](https://taimi.com/support#donotshare) which is located at the footer of Taimi\`s website.

**9.7.**   To help protect your privacy and maintain security, we take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your data or complying with your request. If requests from a consumer are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, we may either charge a reasonable fee, taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action requested, or refuse to act on the request and notify you the reason for refusing the request.

**10.Notice to Virginia Residents**

Consumers residing in Virginia are afforded certain additional rights with respect to their personal information under the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (VCDPA). If you are a Virginia resident, this section applies to you.

**10.1.** **Our collection and use of personal information.** You may find the categories of personal information Taimi collects and the purposes and sources for which your personal information is collected in section 5.4 hereof.

**10.2.** **Process your sensitive data.** We do process your sensitive data concerning a natural person’s sex life and sexual orientation. We may ask to give your consent to process and these categories of your sensitive information and make them public to other users. Still, all any time, you are entitled to make us stop showing that data to others by deleting relevant tags in your profile setting. You give us consent to process your precise geolocation data when you allow through your mapping phone service as Google Maps to access your location while you are using our App. Please see section 8. 1 (d) above on how to restrict the processing of your geolocation data.

**10.3.** **Exercising** **your** **consumer rights:** You have the right to request (1) to confirm whether or not a controller is processing the consumer's personal data and to access such personal data; (2) To correct inaccuracies in the consumer's personal data, taking into account the nature of the personal data and the purposes of the processing of the consumer's personal data; (3) To delete personal data provided by or obtained about the consumer; (4) To obtain a copy of the consumer's personal data that the consumer previously provided to the controller in a portable and, to the extent technically feasible, readily usable format that allows the consumer to transmit the data to another controller without hindrance, where the processing is carried out by automated means; (5) to opt out of the processing of the personal data for purposes of targeted advertising.

You may exercise your rights by contacting us at [support@taimi.com](mailto:support@taimi.com). See more details in section 11 below. We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your rights under the VCDPA. You may contact us at [support@taimi.com](mailto:support@taimi.com) if you want to appeal Taimi\`s refusal to take action on your request. The appeal process is conspicuously available and similar to the process for submitting requests. Taimi will have 60 days of receipt of an appeal to inform you in writing of any action taken or not taken in response to the appeal. If the appeal is denied, you may contact the Attorney General to submit a complaint.

**10.4.** **Sale of personal information and process of personal information for targeted advertising.**  We do not sell your personal information. We do not exchange your personal data for monetary consideration with third parties, so no opt-out choice is necessary for that. However, we do process your personal information for targeted advertising in the sense of VCDPA. We display advertisements to you where such adds are based on personal data obtained from nonaffiliated websites or online applications. You can opt out of the processing of the personal data for purposes of targeted advertising by contacting us at [support@taimi.com](mailto:support@taimi.com). 

  

**11\.  Data Subjects’ Access and Erasure Requests**

**11.1.** **Method for Submitting Requests**. If you are an EU user, you may exercise your right to file a request to access or delete your data by contacting us at [support@taimi.com](mailto:support@taimi.com) or via the App. In the event you are a California or Virginia consumer, you may exercise your privacy rights according to section 9 or 10 accordingly. 

**11.2.** **Timeframes**. In the event you submit your request to us, we will act as follows:

(a)   within 10 business days following a confirmation of receipt of your letter, we shall request that you provide us with relevant data for a verification procedure;

(b)   if you are a California or Virginia consumer, we will have 45 calendar days following the date of your request to process your request. In the event of your failure to pass the verification process within 45 calendar days, we may deny your request or prolong the term of processing up to additional 45 calendar days; please be sure that we will notify you about our decision;

(c)   if you are an EU or UK user, we will have 30 calendar days following the date that you provide us with the data required for verification to process your request. In the event of your failure to pass the verification process, we may deny your request. We are entitled to prolong the response term up to 2 months by giving you a notification.

**11.3.** **Verification and automated decision-making**. The most important step is the verification process. We will first check that we have enough information to be sure of your identity. Often, we will have no reason to doubt a person’s identity (if you contact us via the App, for example). In most cases we use a combination of the automated system and a team of moderators to verify the users\` identity and users are not robots. And we also want to avoid fake Taimi accounts being created which can be used for malicious activities and cybercrime – they threaten the Taimi network and spoil things for everyone. If you choose to verify your profile photo, our automated system will scan each photo that you submit. So, automated decision-making is necessary in order to help ensure that you are who you say you are before entering into a contract with you. This ultimately assists our efforts to prevent and respond to illegal, malicious, and unauthorized activity. We do not add the verification photos to your profile.

Taimi employs automated decision-making as part of our moderation efforts to detect and remove spammers, non-compliant images, messages, bots, etc. through artificial intelligence. This processing may lead to blocking or suspension of your account on the mobile application and the restriction of your further use of the mobile application, without prejudice to other legal actions we could take.

If we have good grounds to doubt your identity, we may ask you to provide additional evidence we reasonably need to confirm your identity (human verification). For example, we may ask you for a piece of information held in your profile that we would expect you to know: your location, last 5 connections, etc. If we have serious doubts about your identity, we may ask you to share with Taimi your photo with your ID document or an image of your ID document. In the event you fail the verification process, your request will be rejected.

As with any automated system, there is a chance for compliant accounts to be detected by our system as breaching our security. Please be assured that we give all our users an opportunity to express their point of view and contest the automated decision to our Support team at [support@taimi.com](mailto:support@taimi.com).

**11.4. Authorized Agent**. You, as a California consumer, may assign your agent to submit a request on your behalf. If you desire to use this way, your agent shall provide us with your written authorization. Owing to a sensitive nature of your data, we reserve the right to reject, at any time, requests concerning your data submitted by any third party.

  

**12\.**     **Third-Party Websites** 

**12.1.** The Services may contain links to websites operated and maintained by third parties, over which we have no control. Privacy policies of such linked websites may be different from this Policy. You access such linked websites at your own risk. Similarly, the Service may be accessed and used by third-party websites that we do not control. We have no control over the privacy policies of such third-party websites, and you access such third-party websites at your own risk.

**13\.**     **Data Protection; Security**

**13.1.** We incorporate commercially reasonable safeguards to help protect and secure your data. At Taimi, your privacy and security come first. We are always working to keep your personal information safe with top-notch security measures that we improve continuously. Here is how we protect your data:

(a) **Data Retention Policy:** We retain your personal information only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected or as required by applicable laws and regulations. This ensures that your data is managed responsibly and deleted securely when no longer needed. For more information on data retention and deletion,  please refer to Section 6. hereof.

(b) **Password Policy:** We enforce a strong password policy that includes requirements for minimum length, complexity, and regular changes. Passwords must contain a combination of alphabetic and non-alphabetic characters and cannot be reused for a specified number of cycles. We also utilize password management programs to enhance security.

(c) **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** To enhance security, we use MFA for accessing sensitive data and systems. This adds an additional layer of protection by requiring multiple forms of verification before granting access.

(d) **Automatic Log Out:** Our systems are configured to automatically log out after a period of inactivity to prevent unauthorized access. This helps protect your personal data from being accessed if you forget to log out manually.

(e) **Encryption and Secure Storage:** We employ industry-standard encryption to protect your data both in transit and at rest, ensuring that your personal information is handled with the highest level of security.

(f) **Access Controls and Monitoring:** We implement strict access control measures to ensure that only a limited number of authorized personnel have access to your personal data. Access rights are regularly reviewed and adjusted as necessary to maintain security and compliance.

(g) **Regular Security Audits and Assessments:** Our team conducts regular audits and vulnerability assessments to identify and address potential security risks. This proactive approach helps us stay ahead of emerging threats and continuously improve our security measures.

(h) **Physical Security Safeguards:** We implement comprehensive physical security measures to protect personal data. This includes monitoring facility access, restricting entry to sensitive areas, positioning computers to prevent unauthorized viewing, securely storing files, and ensuring the secure disposal of both electronic and paper records.

(i) **Entry control:** Measures that ensure the establishment of an audit trail to document whether and by whom data have been entered into, modified in or removed from the data processing systems. Entries can only be done by authorized persons that possess the identification key and password. All logins and log-offs as well as entries into the system are logged. The integrity of the data is assured by the software design.

(j) **Data transfer control:** Measures that ensure that during electronic transmission, transport or storage on data carriers data cannot be read, copied, modified or deleted without authorization, and that it can be established and verified to which entities a transfer of data by means of data transmission facilities is planned. All employees have undertaken to comply with the principle of data secrecy and there are capacities for encrypted data transmissions. Furthermore, the data is deleted in accordance with data protection laws after the end of the commission.

(k) **Availability control:** Measures that ensure that the data is protected against accidental destruction or loss. Backup and recovery procedures with a daily mirroring of the data have been implemented. In addition, there is uninterruptible power supply and a firewall system as well as port regulations are in place.

(l) **Data protection by design and default:** Taimi only collects data that is mandatory for the provision of the Services.

**13.2.** To protect you and others, we may monitor your use of the Services and use your personal data and/or other information we collect in order to: 

* identify and prevent fraudulent activities and transactions,
* prevent abuse of and investigate and/or prosecute potential threats to or misuse of the Service, ensure compliance with the [Terms of Service](https://taimi.com/terms) and this Policy,
* protect the rights and property of you, Taimi, its partners and other customers.

This security monitoring may result in the collection, recording, and analysis of online activity or communications through the Services. If you do not consent to these conditions, you must discontinue your use of the Services.

**13.3.** We regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks and regularly review our information collection, storage and processing practices to update our physical, technical and organizational security measures.

**13.4.** **TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO ANY BREACHES OF SECURITY, DAMAGE TO YOUR DEVICE, OR ANY LOSS OR UNAUTHORISED USE OF YOUR REGISTRATION INFORMATION OR OTHER DATA.**

**14\.**     **Reach us Out** 

**14.1.** We would be glad to hear from you. If you have any questions regarding this Policy, please contact us at [support@taimi.com](mailto:support@taimi.com) or [legal@taimi.com](mailto:legal@taimi.com).
