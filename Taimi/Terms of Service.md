* All prices are subject to change without previous notice at Taimi's sole discretion.
    
* If you pay for a subscription and do not cancel your subscription at least 24 hours prior to the end of the subscription term, your subscription will be automatically extended at the end of each term for successive renewal periods of equal duration to the subscription term originally selected (for example, unless you cancel, a one-month subscription will automatically renew on a monthly basis).
