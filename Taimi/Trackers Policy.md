Taimi Cookie Policy
===================

Effective Date: November 10, 2023

This Cookie Policy (the “Policy”) is an integral part of the [Taimi’s Terms of Service](https://taimi.com/terms) (the “Terms”) and [Privacy Policy](https://taimi.com/privacy-policy) (the “Privacy Policy”). All the terms used herein shall have the same meaning as the Terms and Privacy Policy provide, unless otherwise indicated hereby.

**Any translation from English version is provided for your convenience only. In the event of any difference in meaning or interpretation between the English language version of this Cookie Policy and any translation, the English language version will prevail. The original English text shall be the sole legally binding version.**

1\. Changes and Updates to Policy
---------------------------------

1.1. All changes to this Policy shall be made and published as outlined in paragraph 2 of the Privacy Policy.

2\. Why Taimi Needs Tracking Technologies
-----------------------------------------

2.1. Like many companies, we use cookies (as defined in subparagraph 3.1. of the Policy) and other tracking technologies on the Website or on the Taimi mobile application (jointly, “cookies” unless otherwise stated) including web beacons/GIFs as defined below.

2.2. We use cookies and other tracking technologies- particularly to improve user experience and obtain data about how the Website is being used. The details of the cookies and tracking technologies used are specified below.

2.3. The drop or the reading of certain cookies does not require your prior consent, either because they do not process any of your personal data, or because they are strictly necessary for the supply of the Services. You can decide whether or not to allow the drop of cookies which are not strictly necessary to operate the computer. If you agree (consent), these cookies will be stored to allow you to access third party hosted content on the website or on the mobile application. You may, at any time, object to the storage or the reading of the cookies we use, either by deleting them from your devices or by changing your browser settings.

3\. Tracking Technologies
-------------------------

3.1. Cookies are small pieces of code that are stored in your device (computer, digital tablet, smartphone) when you browse and use online services. They are installed on your device to enable different useful features, for example, to facilitate navigation on the Website. After installed on your device, cookies may be either deleted automatically, when you close the Website/web browser (session cookies), or stored in your device to facilitate future visits to the Website or to the mobile application (persistent cookies). Persistent cookies are automatically deleted after a period of time set by the cookies’ owner.

3.2. Web beacons are small graphic images or other web programming code (also known as “1×1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) that may be included in the Website’s and mobile application’s pages and our messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a page or email can act as a web beacon. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar, in function, to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.

3.3. In some cases, cookies are used to collect data that is recognized as personal data, such as, but not limited to, IP addresses and data linked to the IP address. The usage of such cookies is regulated by the data protection laws and you, as a user, obtain a number of rights to control the collection and processing of this data.

3.4. While providing you with our services, we may use the following cookies: a) essential or strictly necessary cookies; b) performance cookies; c) analytical cookies; d) targeting/advertising cookies. These cookies may be session or persistent.

3.5. Session cookies are only stored temporarily in the browser’s memory and are destroyed once you quit the browser. However, they will survive navigating away from the Website they came from. If no expiration date is set, they are automatically considered as session cookies.  Persistent cookies are saved on your computer, so when you shut it down and start it up again, they can still be there; they are created by giving them an expiry date and once that expiry date is reached, they will be automatically destroyed by the computer itself. If an expiry date is not set, they are automatically session cookies.

3.6. “Essential” or “Strictly Necessary” cookies are strongly required for an error-free operation of the website and of the Taimi mobile application, as well as for its security and accessibility. We also need them to remember your preference about cookies. Without them, we will not be able to provide you with the Services in a proper way. Although you cannot refuse these cookies through the Website or the mobile application, you may disable them by changing your browser settings, but this may affect the Website’s or the mobile application’s functionality. These cookies are mostly session and expire on quitting the browser.

3.7. “Performance” cookies collect information about how you use the Website, for instance which pages you go to most often, and if they get error messages from web pages. These cookies don’t collect information that identifies you. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore, anonymous. It is only used to improve how the website and the Taimi mobile application’s works. Generally, these cookies are a mix of session and persistent cookies.

3.8. “Analytical” cookies allow us to track your activity on the Website or on the mobile application. We may track the number of sessions, measure duration, characteristics of your device, pages you visit, etc. We do so to optimize the Website and the Taimi mobile application and make it more interesting and useful for you. The data collected in such a way is stored in aggregated form. Generally, these cookies are a mix of session and persistent cookies.

3.9. “Targeting/Advertising” cookies allow us to show you our advertisements on third-party websites. This tool is called “retargeting”. It enables us to provide you with ads based on your previous activity on the Website. It also enables us to limit how many times you see the respective ads. Generally, these cookies are persistent cookies.

3.10. We may use the following cookies:
