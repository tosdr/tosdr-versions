“**Information**,” as used in this Privacy Policy, means personal information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular user or household.

We collect and/or have collected over the past twelve (12) months the following categories of information about you and other users of the Website:

* **Information You Provide to Us.** We collect information from you when you voluntarily provide it to us over the Website, including as part of registering a user account. Such information may include your name, email address, telephone number(s), street address, city, and state. Additionally, if you are an inmate, we may collect your eye color, hair color, hometown, date of birth, the address you plan to reside upon release, your earliest release date, your latest release date, your incarcerated since date, whether you are serving a life sentence or if you are on death row, and your criminal history including the crime you were arrested for, the arresting agency, and the city and state where the crime was committed.
* **Content You Make Public.** Company collects information from you that you voluntarily upload to the Website for public display (“Public Information”), such as your Content, which may include posts, comments, photos, text, and artwork. Once you submit Public Information, neither you nor Company are able to control how it may be copied, shared, or used by third parties, even if you and/or Company later delete such Public Information. Accordingly, you should carefully consider what personal information you choose to make public.
* **Transaction and Payment Information.** We collect information from you, as needed, to process payments to administer your participation on the Website, such as your bank account number, payment card number, expiration date, card verification number, and billing address. Specifically, we use third-party integration through Authorize.Net to process payments. For more information about Authorize.Net’s privacy practices, visit https://usa.visa.com/legal/privacy-policy.html.
* **Device/Internet Connection Information.** When you use the Website, we automatically gather information made available by your web browser (such as Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome), internet service provider (such as Comcast or Cox), and device (such as your computer, phone, tablet, or fitness tracker), depending on your settings for each. For example, we may collect your IP address, information about the operating system or type of device you use, the device ID associated with your device, the date and time you access the Website, and your log in attempts. 
* **Internet Activity Information.** As explained below, we may also collect information about your browsing history, search history, and information regarding your interaction with a particular website, application, or advertisement, including the Website.

* **Geolocation Information.** We may collect information about where you are located, both generally and at the time you access the Website. For example, we may collect your mailing address or ascertain your approximate location from your IP address.
* **Protected Class Information.** Due to the specific nature of our services, you may be asked to provide information about your race, ethnicity, nationality, gender, age, marital or family status, sexual orientation, religion, and/or whether you served in the military.
* **Education and Employment Information.** We may collect information about your educational background including your highest level of education, previous schools attended, your education goals, whether you are currently in school, and any recent educational accomplishments. We may also collect your employment history and employment goals.
* **Other Information.** From time to time, we may collect other information from you, such as when you make a claim for a promotion run on the Website, when you request assistance through our Website, or when you voluntarily subscribe to promotions, reminders, or newsletters. You will always be asked for your consent in advance.

**3\. How do we collect information about you?**

We gather information about you through the following sources and means:

* **When you communicate with us.** We may collect information from you outside of your use of the Website, such as if you email us (or respond to a communication) or communicate with us over social media. Information collected outside your use of the Website may be combined with information collected through your use of the Website —for example, if you create an account through the Website and later call us about your account, the information collected in both interactions may be linked.
* **Information from Third Parties.** We may collect information about you from third parties or other sources, such as when an individual creates an account on behalf of an inmate or other publicly available information about you, including but not limited to, your photo, biographical information, criminal background, and general geographic location or place of incarceration.

The same applies to such processing operations which are necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures. In so far as the processing of information is required to comply with a legal obligation to which our Company is subject, Art. 6(1) lit. c GDPR serves as legal basis.

If processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by our Company or by a Third Party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject, processing operations are based on Art 6 (1) lit. f GDPR.

**5\. How do we share your information?**

Non-incarcerated persons use our Website to search for inmates to correspond with. Any information included in an inmate’s profile, including their name, photo, biography, criminal background, and location can be seen by all visitors and users of the Website.

In addition to the foregoing, WriteAPrisoner may share your information with third parties for business and commercial purposes as outlined below:

| Third Parties | Business Purpose | Types of Information |

| **Our Affiliated Entities.** Affiliated entities are different than Third Parties in that they are businesses that are directly related to us and have common ownership with us.

**6\. Do we sell your information to others?**

No, WriteAPrisoner does not sell, rent, or otherwise disclose information that reasonably identifies you. We have not sold consumers’ personal information during the past twelve (12) months.

**7\. How do we protect your information?**

We have implemented appropriate security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, it is impossible to guarantee the safety of data. We will do our best to protect your information, but the safety and security of your information also depends on you. Never share your password with anyone else and notify us as soon as possible if you believe your account security has been breached.

**8\. How long do we keep your information?**

WriteAPrisoner retains your information for the length of time necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law or valid court order. When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your information, we will delete it, or, if this is not possible (for example because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information until deletion is possible.

**9\. Do we transfer your information to a different country?**

If you are visiting the Website from a location outside of the United States, your connection will be through and to servers located in the United States, and all information you provide will be processed and securely maintained in our web servers and internal systems located within the United States. By using the Website, **you authorize and specifically consent to the transfer of personal data to the United States** and its storage and use as specified above when you provide such information to us.

**10\. What are your rights when it comes to accessing, correcting, or deleting your information, and how can you exercise them?**

Based on the state or country you are located in, you may have the right to request access to the personal information we collect from you, request changes to your personal information, or in some circumstances request deletion. To request to review, update, or delete your personal information, please contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://writeaprisoner.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). We will respond to your request within 30 days.

If you are in the European Union, you have certain rights under the GDPR. Under the GDPR you may have the right to request access to and obtain a copy of your personal information we have collected, request rectification or erasure of your personal information, restrict the processing of your personal information, and, if applicable, request data portability. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. To make any of the above requests, please contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://writeaprisoner.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws. For purposes of this section, your data controller is WriteAPrisoner.com, Inc.

If you have any questions about your privacy rights, please contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://writeaprisoner.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

**11\. Privacy Practices of Third Parties**

Our Website may include advertisements, content, or links to content, products or services provided by third parties. This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information by WriteAPrisoner through your interaction with the Website. Third-Party Services that may be accessible through links from our Website have their own privacy policies and information collection, use, and disclosure practices. Third-party sellers, advertisers, and partners also have their own privacy practices. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with the privacy statements provided by these third parties prior to providing them with information or taking advantage of a third-party offer or promotion.

**12\. How do we protect the privacy of children?**

WriteAPrisoner does not knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 18. If we obtain actual knowledge that we have collected information about a child under the age of 18, that information will be immediately deleted from our database. Because we do not collect such information, we have no such information to use or to disclose to third parties.

**13\. How can you receive and opt-out from marketing communications?**

By providing your contact information through the Website or an email initiated by you, **you consent to receive emails from us, including information concerning your account and advertising messages.** Depending upon your location, we may obtain additional consent from you via a checkbox disclosure or an email requesting confirmation before you can receive such information.

Providing consent to promotional emails is NOT a condition of purchasing any goods or services from WriteAPrisoner. You can unsubscribe to advertising emails at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link within the email, or by contacting us at [\[email protected\]](https://writeaprisoner.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). Please note that, even if you unsubscribe from advertising emails, we will still send you any necessary, non-promotional emails about your purchase, account, or updates to our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.

**14\. Do we respond to Do Not Track (DNT) Signals?**

DNT is a feature offered by some browsers which, when enabled, sends a signal to websites to request that your browsing is not tracked.  We do not respond to DNT requests.
