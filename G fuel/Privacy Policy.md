**PRIVACY POLICY**

**G FUEL LLC PRIVACY POLICY**  

Last Updated: October 22, 2024

G Fuel LLC (“we”, “us”, or “our”) is pleased to provide you with access to our Services. This Privacy Policy describes our practices with respect to the collection, transfer, manipulation, disclosure and other uses of Your Information and certain other information collected by us through our Services. For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Your Information” means information about you which may be of a confidential nature and may include personally identifiable information, including your first and last name and email address. Capitalized but undefined terms in this Privacy Policy will have the meanings ascribed to them in our [Terms & Conditions of Service](https://gfuel.com/policies/terms-of-service). 

This Privacy Policy applies to information collected by us through our Services and through our telephone support number, but does not apply to information collected by any person or entity other than us, even if related to our Services (such as a third-party website, content, application, that may link to or be accessible from or on our Services). 

PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY BEFORE USING OUR SERVICES. BY USING OUR SERVICES, OR BY CLICKING TO ACCEPT OR AGREE TO OUR TERMS WHEN THIS OPTION IS MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND AND ABIDE BY OUR TERMS, INCLUDING THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT WANT YOUR INFORMATION USED OR DISCLOSED IN THE MANNER DESCRIBED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY, OR IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY TERM OR CONDITION IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY OR OUR [TERMS](https://gfuel.com/policies/terms-of-service), THEN YOU MUST NOT ACCESS OR USE OUR SERVICES OR SUBMIT YOUR INFORMATION TO US.   

This Privacy Policy may change from time to time (see “Changes to our Privacy Policy”). Your continued use of our Services after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check this policy periodically for updates. 

**1\. Children: Data Processing and Consent**

Our Services are intended to be accessed and used only by adults and are not directed to minors. If you are below the age of 18, you may access and participate in our Services only under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be bound by this Privacy Policy and our [Terms](https://gfuel.com/policies/terms-of-service).  

We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information by anyone under the age of 13 and you should not provide us with any information regarding any individual under the age of 13.  If we learn that we have inadvertently gathered information from anyone under the age of 13, we will take reasonable measures to promptly remove that information from our records.  

Persons subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), and who are under 16 years of age may not access, use, or participate in our Services (and we will not process such person’s data) absent the consent of a parent or holder of parental responsibility over such person.  

**2\. What Information We Collect and How We Collect It**  

We receive and collect several types of information about you, such as the information described below.   
   
Information you provide to us: From time to time, you may provide us with certain information, including Your Information or information of third parties. Instances where you may provide this information include when you purchase products through our Services, call our telephone support number, create, manipulate or update accounts on or through our Services, fill out forms or fields on or through our Services, or sign up for any promotions or to receive newsletters or other materials about our Services or those of third parties. By way of example, when you purchase products through our Services, you may provide your first and last name, shipping address, billing address, email, phone number and payment information (collectively, “Order Information”).   

Information we receive from third parties:  We may obtain information about you from sources other than you, such as from our social media networks on or through which you may access the Site, and/or from other third party website operators on which we or our third party service providers have placed pixel tags (as defined below) in order to drive traffic to our Services. The information that we will receive depends on the third party and your privacy settings with that third party. All information that you disclose to third parties will be subject to the privacy policies and practices of such third parties. You should review the privacy policies and practices of such third parties prior to disclosing information to them. 

We also collect information on third party platforms such as HubSpot, ShipHero, Google AdWords, Google Analytics, Klaviyo Group, etc.  

Information we collect through automatic data collection technologies: We and third parties acting on our behalf may use various technologies to collect and store information when you use our Services, including sending cookies, web beacons, pixel tags or other anonymous identifiers to your device, or otherwise tracking your activities on our Services over time. We will not share your opt-in to an SMS campaign with any third party for purposes unrelated to providing you with the services of that campaign. We may share your Personal Data, including your SMS opt-in or consent status, with third parties that help us provide our messaging services, including but not limited to platform providers, phone companies, and any other vendors who assist us in the delivery of text messages.

“Cookies” are pieces of data stored on a computer, mobile phone or other device. A “web beacon” is a type of technology that lets us know if you visited a certain page or whether you opened an email. A “pixel tag” is a type of technology placed within a website or e-mail for the purpose of tracking activity, which is often used in combination with Cookies. Other “anonymous identifiers” include random strings of characters used for the same purposes as Cookies, such as with mobile devices where Cookie technology may not be available. These technologies help us know that you are logged on to or using our Services, provide you with features based on your preferences, help us understand when and how you are interacting with our Services and compile other information regarding your use of our Services. We also may use these technologies to collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites (a practice known as behavioral tracking). For example, third parties, including Amazon, may place and use pixel tags on our Services to show interest-based ads to you on sites across the Internet. The G FUEL website uses cookies to help keep track of items you put into your shopping cart including when you have abandoned your cart and this information is used to determine when to send cart reminder messages via SMS.  

The information collected through these technologies, standing alone, cannot be used to determine your identity. Such information may, however, be combined in a way that makes it become personally identifiable information (i.e., information that can identify you). For example, we may tie this information to personal information about you that we collect from other sources or that you provide to us. If this happens, we will treat the combined information as personally identifiable information.   

It may be possible to disable some (but not all) Cookies or automatic data collection technologies through your device or browser settings, but doing so may affect the functionality of our Services. The method for disabling Cookies or other automatic collection technologies may vary by device and browser, but can usually be found in preferences or security settings. For example, iOS and Android devices each have settings which are designed to limit forms of ad tracking.   

To make a do-not-track request with respect to behavioral tracking on our Services or to receive information on how we respond to web browser signals and other mechanisms that enable consumers to exercise their choice about behavioral tracking, please contact us at [privacy@gfuel.com](mailto:privacy@gfuel.com) or in writing at the address provided below. You can also opt-out of receiving interest-based ads from third parties as described in the “Online Behavioral Advertising” section of Section 5 below. 

Privacy Policy Coordinator 

G Fuel, LLC  
100 Wireless Blvd  
Hauppauge, New York 11788-3955, United States 

In contacting us, you must include the reference to our “Privacy Policy” on the subject line and in the body of the message and include the email or physical address for us to send our response. We reserve the right not to respond to inquiries submitted other than to the address specified above. 

Our Collection Practices with Respect to Certain Specific Information: 

 _General Use and Preference Information_. We may collect, receive and store information regarding your general use of our Services (such as details of how and when you used our Services, interactions with our Services, log in information, resources that you access, your Internet protocol address, your browser type and your device type), as well as your preferences.  

_Device Information_. When you access or use our Services through your computer, mobile phone or other device, we may collect information regarding and related to your device, such as hardware models and IDs, device type, operating system version, the request type, the content of your request and basic usage information about your use of our Services, such as date and time. In addition, we may collect information regarding application-level events, such as crashes, and associate that temporarily with your account (if any) to provide customer service. We may also collect and store information locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage and application data caches. 

_Location Information_. If you submit your zip code or other geographic information to us, you may provide us with your location information. Furthermore, if you enable the collection of location information on your device, then we may collect information about your actual location, such as your mobile device’s GPS coordinates. We may also use other technologies to determine your location (such as through the location of nearby Wi-Fi access points or cell towers), or obtain your location information from third parties.  

   
Third-party content providers may collect information: Some content or applications, including advertisements, on our Services may be served by third parties, including advertisers, ad networks and servers, content providers and application providers. These third parties may collect information about you when you use our Services using cookies alone or in conjunction with web beacons or other tracking technologies. We do not control these third parties' tracking technologies or how they may be used. If you have any questions about an advertisement or other targeted content, you should contact the responsible provider directly. Please note that the information collected by these third parties may be associated with Your Information and that these third parties may collect information, including Your Information, about your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services.  

**3\. How We Use Your Information**  

 We may use the information we collect for various lawful business purposes and for related legitimate interests. Among others, these purposes and interests may include using this information, including Your Information, to: 

* _Present our Services, product or services, and related content to you_. For example, if you provide us with your contact information for purposes of receiving newsletters, emails, promotional materials or other information or content from us, we will use the information you provide us to send you such information or materials. Additionally, we may use Your Information to administer rewards, surveys, giveaways, or other promotional activities. 
* _Contact you and provide you with information_. For example, we might contact you via e-mail or other communications to provide you with Site or service offering updates, promotions, offers, personalized information and other information from us or our third-party service providers or business partners or to respond to comments, inquiries, job applications, and other information submitted by you. 
* _Provide you with customer support. For example, if you call our telephone support line, we may collect certain information from you in order to assist you in the use of our Services._
* _Analyze, improve and manage our Services, products, service offerings and operations._ For example, we might obtain feedback regarding our Services, products, and service offerings, understand and anticipate your needs and preferences, better understand your use of our Services or products or service offerings, customize and tailor Site content and advertising, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, engage in statistical analysis and provide feedback or information to our business partners, vendors, advertisers and other third parties. 
* _Resolve problems and disputes, and engage in other legal and security matters_. For example, we may use the information we collect to comply with, monitor compliance with and enforce this Privacy Policy, our Terms (including any terms and conditions incorporated or reference in our [Terms of Service](https://gfuel.com/policies/terms-of-service)) and any other applicable agreements and policies, meet other legal and regulatory requirements, and protect the security and integrity of our Services. We might also use information that we collect to investigate any complaint you make regarding our Services, content, products, service offerings or other related matters, to provide evidence in any dispute or anticipated dispute between you and us, or to prevent fraud or other criminal or otherwise inappropriate activities. 
* _Display advertisements to our advertisers' target audiences_. For example, we may use your device information for direct advertising and retargeting ads, such as providing you with information or advertising relating to our products or services based on your precise geolocation, when in line with the preferences you have shared with us. Additionally, even though we do not disclose your personal information for these purposes without your consent, if you click on or otherwise interact with an advertisement, the advertiser may assume that you meet its target criteria. Note also that our third- party content providers may use information they collect via our Services to provide you with interest-based (aka behavioral) advertising or other targeted content. 
* _Comply with a request from you in connection with the exercise of your rights._ For example, where you have asked us not to contact you for marketing purposes, we or our service providers will keep a record of this on our suppression lists to be able to comply with your request. 
* _Other Purposes._ We may also use your information in other ways. To the extent required by applicable law, we will provide notice at the time of collection and obtain your consent. 

**4\. How We Disclose Your Information**

Other Disclosures by Us: 

_Aggregation and De-Personalization_. We may use and disclose any de-identified information for any lawful purpose, including for any commercial purpose. De-identified Information means Information that does not identify you, including any identifiable information de-identified by either combining it with information about others, for example, by aggregating Your Information with information about other persons, or by removing characteristics, such as your name, that make the information personally identifiable to you.

Therefore, you use our Services at your own risk, you should not expect that Your Information will always remain private, and we do not guarantee the performance or adequacy of our security measures.

8. Comply with a legal obligation. 
9. Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided 

Exercising Your Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights: 

_How to Exercise_. To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by emailing us at [privacy@gfuel.com](mailto:privacy@gfuel.com) or calling us at 877-426-6262. Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.  

_General Requirements_. You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative. It must also describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. 

 We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.  We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request. 

_Response Timing and Format_. We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. If you have an account with us, we may deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. 

 Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance. 

 We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request. 

Non-Discrimination:  We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not: 

* Deny you goods or services. 
* Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties. 
* Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services. 
* Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services. 

However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your personal information's value and contain written terms that describe the program's material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time. 

Other California Privacy Rights: California's “Shine the Light” law permits users of our Services that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an email to [privacy@gfuel.com](mailto:privacy@gfuel.com) or write us at:
