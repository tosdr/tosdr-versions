Last Updated: October 22, 2024

Welcome to G Fuel! G Fuel, LLC (“we”, “us”, “our”, or “G Fuel”) are pleased to provide you with access to our “Services,” which means, collectively, (i) our website [https://gfuel.com/](https://gfuel.com/) and its related domains (“Site”), (ii) our GFUEL device application(s), (iii) any email notifications or other mediums, or portions of such mediums, through which you have accessed these Terms of Service (these “Terms”), and (iv) any information, data, material, and content viewable on, contained in or downloadable from any of the foregoing. Capitalized but undefined terms in these Terms will have the meanings ascribed to them in our [Privacy Policy](https://gfuel.com/policies/privacy-policy "Privacy Policy").

Please read these Terms carefully before accessing or using our Services. By accessing or using any part of our Services **or by clicking to accept or agree to these Terms when this option is made available to you**, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions in these Terms, then you may not access or use the Site or any of our other Services. Any new features or tools which are added to our Services shall also be subject to these Terms.

**PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT THESE TERMS CONTAIN AN AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE ALL CLAIMS AND DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES AND LIABILITY. THESE TERMS ALSO ALLOW YOU TO PURSUE CLAIMS AGAINST US ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND NOT AS PART OF ANY CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. AS A RESULT, YOU MAY SEEK RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.** 

**WE MAY IMMEDIATELY TERMINATE YOUR ACCESS TO OUR SERVICES (IN WHOLE OR IN PART) IF YOU FAIL TO COMPLY WITH ANY PROVISION OF THESE TERMS, IF WE BELIEVE YOUR USE OF ALL OR ANY PORTION OF OUR SERVICES WILL REFLECT POORLY ON US, OUR SERVICES OR OUR GOODWILL, OR IF WE OTHERWISE DEEM YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICES TO BE ILLEGAL OR OTHERWISE INAPPROPRIATE, IN EACH CASE, IN OUR SOLE AND ABSOLUTE DISCRETION.**

1. **Changes to these Terms**

We may revise and update these Terms (including our [Privacy Policy](https://gfuel.com/policies/privacy-policy "Privacy Policy") and [Shipping & Returns Policy](https://gfuel.com/pages/shipping "Shipping & Return Policy")) from time to time in our sole discretion. All changes are effective immediately when we post them. Your continued use of our Services following the posting of revised Terms means that you accept and agree to the changes. You are expected to check this page each time you access our Services so you are aware of any changes, as they are binding on you.

1. **General Conditions**

You acknowledge that these Terms are supported by reasonable and valuable consideration, which you have received, and which is adequate. Such consideration includes your ability to access, use or interact with our Services. You represent and warrant that you have the capacity to be bound by these Terms.

By using our Services, you represent that you are at least the age of majority in your state or territory of residence, and, if applicable, you have given us your consent to allow any of your minor dependents to use our Services. We reserve the right to refuse our Services to anyone for any reason at any time.

1. **Accuracy and Completeness of Information**

The information presented on or through our Services is made available solely for general information purposes. We do not warrant the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of this information. Any reliance you place on such information is strictly at your own risk. We disclaim all liability and responsibility arising from any reliance placed on such materials by you or any other third party, or by anyone who may be informed of any of its contents.

1. **Product and Service Information**

Certain products or services may be available exclusively online through the Site or our other Services. These products or services may have limited quantities and are subject to our [Shipping & Returns Policy](https://gfuel.com/pages/shipping "Shipping & Returns Policy"). Prices for our products are subject to change at any time without notice to you. We reserve the right at any time to modify or discontinue our Services (or any part or content thereof) without notice at any time. We shall not be liable to you or to any third-party for any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of our Services.

We reserve the right, but are not obligated, to limit the sales of our products or services to any person, geographic region or jurisdiction. We reserve the right to limit the quantities of any products or services that we offer. All descriptions of products or product pricing are subject to change at any time without notice to you, in our sole discretion. We reserve the right to discontinue any product at any time. Any offer for any product or service made on or through our Services is void where prohibited.

We do not warrant that the quality of any products, services, information, or other material purchased or obtained by you on or through our Services will meet your expectations, or that any errors in our Services will be corrected. All material and information presented by us is intended to be used for personal, or informational purposes only. The statements and products sold through us are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any condition, illness or disease.

All products should be used strictly in accordance with their instructions, directions, precautions and guidelines. You should always check the ingredients for products to avoid potential allergic reactions. Use of our Services is not meant to serve as a substitute for professional medical advice. Please consult with your own physician or health care practitioner regarding the use of any goods, products or information received via our Services before using or relying on them. Your physician or health care practitioner should address any and all medical questions, concerns and decisions regarding the possible treatment of any medical condition. We do not give or intend to give any answers to medical related questions and our Services do not replace any medical professional or medical resource. We do not represent to be a physician nor is this implied.

1. **Purchases**

We reserve the right, without prior notice, to discontinue or change specifications and prices on products without incurring any obligation to you. We do not warrant that product descriptions are accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free, or that product packaging depicted on our Services will match the actual product that you receive. If a product described on our Services is not as described when you receive it, or the packaging on our Services does not match the product you receive, your sole remedy is to return it to us in an unused and undamaged condition in accordance with our [Shipping & Returns Policy](https://gfuel.com/pages/shipping "Shipping & Returns Policy"). Please be aware that prices, availability and other purchase terms are subject to change without prior notice.

We reserve the right to refuse any order you place with us. We may, in our sole discretion, limit or cancel quantities purchased per person, per household or per order. These restrictions may include orders placed by the same credit card, or orders that use the same billing or shipping address. In the event that we make a change to or cancel an order, we may attempt to notify you by contacting the e-mail or billing address or phone number provided at the time the order was made. We reserve the right to limit or prohibit orders that, in our sole judgment, appear to be placed by dealers, resellers or distributors.

Coupon Codes may be revoked or modified by us at any time without notice. G Fuel is not responsible for lost or stolen packages that have a confirmed delivery to the address entered for an order.

For more detail, please review our [Shipping & Returns Policy](https://gfuel.com/pages/shipping "Shipping & Returns Policy").

You represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use any credit card(s) or other payment method(s) in connection with your account or purchase. We may employ the use of third-party services for the purpose of facilitating payment and the completion of purchases. By submitting your information, you grant us the right to provide the information to these third parties subject to our [Privacy Policy](https://gfuel.com/policies/privacy-policy "Privacy Policy").

If you choose, or are provided with, a username, password, or any other piece of information as part of our security procedures, you must treat such information as confidential, and you must not disclose it to any other person or entity.

You acknowledge and agree that: (i) one or more of the functionalities or services available on or via our Services may be made available by third parties (“Third-Party Service Providers” and such functionalities or services, “Third-Party Services”); (ii) certain aspects of our Services rely on API integration for certain features and functions, but that API integration has its own inherent level of unpredictability and inconsistency that is out of our control, and that as such we will have no liability for downtime of any of our Services caused by API integration failures; (iii) Third-Party Service Providers may impose restrictions on use of the particular Third-Party Service, in addition to other terms and conditions, including without limitation, those set forth in any applicable terms and conditions agreed to by or otherwise made available to you (collectively, “Third-Party Requirements”); (iv) you are solely responsible for compliance with, and will ensure that you comply with, all Third-Party Requirements; and (v) we may at any time terminate and/or discontinue any Third-Party Services, including as a result of termination of our relationship with the applicable Third-Party Service Provider.

You may use our Services to watch live esports at [https://gfuel.com/pages/watch-esports](https://gfuel.com/pages/watch-esports)  (the “Theta Page”), which is powered and hosted through a Third-Party Service Provider (currently Theta.tv). Theta.tv’s terms of service and support pages can be found here: [https://legacy.theta.tv/terms-of-service](https://legacy.theta.tv/terms-of-service) and  [https://support.theta.tv/hc/en-us](https://support.theta.tv/hc/en-us).  

We are not responsible for the privacy policies, terms and conditions, practices or the content of third parties, including those of our Third-Party Service Providers. All information that you disclose to such third parties will be subject to the privacy policies and practices of such third parties. You should review the privacy policies and practices of such third parties prior to disclosing information to them. If you have any questions about how these third parties use your information, you should review their policies and contact them direct.

1. **Third-Party Links**

Certain content, products and services available via our Services may include materials from third parties.

Third-party links on our Services may direct you to third-party websites that are not affiliated with us. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating the content or accuracy and we do not warrant and will not have any liability or responsibility for any third-party materials or websites, or for any other materials, products, or services of third parties.

We are not liable for any harm or damages related to the purchase or use of goods, services, resources, content, or any other transactions made in connection with any third-party websites. Please carefully review the third-party's terms and conditions, policies and practices and make sure you understand them before you engage in any transaction. Complaints, claims, concerns, or questions regarding third-party products should be directed to the third-party.

1. **Our “GFUEL” Application**

Aspects of our Services include access and other capabilities in connection with or otherwise relating to our GFUEL application(s) (collectively, “App Services”).

a.  Certain Acknowledgements. By using our App Services, you: (i) acknowledge that these Terms are between you and us and not with Apple, Inc., Google, Inc. or any other third-party; (ii) agree not to use or manipulate our App Services on your computer, mobile or other device while driving or operating any other heavy machinery; (iii) acknowledge that certain parts of our App Services may require internet/data connection, phone service, data access or text messaging capability. Except as otherwise noted, carrier rates for internet/data, phone, data and text messaging will apply; and (iv) acknowledge that we may, in our sole discretion and at any time, change, suspend, remove or disable access to content or other materials comprising part of our App Services at any time without notice. In no event will we be liable for making these changes. We may also impose limits on the use or access of certain features or portions of our App Services, in any case without notice or liability.

b. Scope of License. Any App Services made available by us to you are licensed, not sold, to you. Your license to the App Services is subject to your prior acceptance of these Terms and you agree that these Terms will apply to the App Services that you license. We reserve all rights in and to any App Services not expressly granted to you under these Terms. The license granted to you for any of our App Services is a limited, non-exclusive and nontransferable license to: (i) download, install and use the App Services for your personal, non-commercial use on a single, compatible device that you own or control (“Device”), as permitted by these Terms and subject to any additional rules and restrictions imposed upon you by third parties, such as rules and restrictions imposed by your mobile device provider and your application store provider (“Third-Party Rules”); and (ii) access, stream, download and use on such Device and our products or services made available in or otherwise accessible through the App Services, strictly in accordance with these Terms. For the avoidance of doubt, this license does not allow you to use any App Services on any Device that you do not own or control, and you may not distribute or make any App Services available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time. If you sell or otherwise transfer your Device to a third party, you must remove any App Services from the Device before doing so.

c.  Updates. We may, at any time and from time to time with or without notice to you, in our sole discretion develop and provide App Services updates, which may include upgrades, bug fixes, patches and other error corrections or new features (collectively, including related documentation, “Updates”). Updates may also modify or delete in their entirety certain features and functionality. We have no obligation to provide any Updates or to continue to provide or enable any particular features or functionality. Based on your Device settings, when your Device is connected to the Internet either: (i) the App Services will automatically download and install all available Updates; or (ii) you may receive notice of or be prompted to download and install available Updates.

1. **DISPUTES: ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, AND CLASS WAIVER**

**Please read this section carefully. Except as these Terms otherwise provide, you waive your rights to try any claim in court before a judge or jury and to bring or participate in any class, collective, or other representative action.**

**21.1       Agreement to Binding Arbitration**

Before initiating arbitration, you acknowledge and agree that you will first give us an opportunity to resolve your problem or dispute. This includes sending a written description of your problem or dispute to us including, but not limited to, information or representations related to our Services and upon which you rely. You may seek to resolve any customer concerns through our support services at [legal@gfuel.com](mailto:legal@gfuel.com) or send the written description by U.S. Mail to 100 Wireless Blvd, Hauppauge, New York 11788-3955; Attn: Legal Department. You agree to negotiate with us in good faith about your problem or dispute. If for some reason your problem or dispute is not resolved to your satisfaction within 30 days after our receipt of your written dispute, you agree to the dispute resolution provisions below.

By agreeing to these Terms, you agree that you are required to resolve any claim that you may have against us on an individual basis in arbitration, as set forth in this Section 21. You and we agree that any disputes between us (including any disputes between you and a third-party agent of G Fuel) will be resolved through binding and final arbitration and not in a court. This includes, but is not limited to, (a) any dispute, claims, or controversy arising out of or relating to any part of these Terms, or the existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof; or (b) your access to or use of our Services at any time. Such dispute shall be submitted to the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) for individual arbitration in Suffolk County, New York (or such other location as you and we mutually agree) and shall be before one arbitrator. The arbitration shall be administered by the AAA pursuant to its Consumer Arbitration Rules and Procedures, only as modified by this Arbitration Agreement.

The parties agree that the arbitrator (“Arbitrator”), and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The Arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether these Terms are unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, or estoppel.

By agreeing to individual arbitration, you understand and agree that you are waiving your right to maintain other available resolution processes, such as a court action or administrative proceeding, to settle any disputes or claims. The rules in arbitration are different. There is no judge or jury. Although review is limited, an Arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as would be available in court, and must enforce the same limitations stated in these Terms as a court would.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court and the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of a party’s copyright rights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.

**21.2       No Class Action**

You and we each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action. This means that you and we each agree to arbitrate in our individual capacities only, not as a representative of a class, a member of a class, or a Private Attorney General. Likewise, an Arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

**21.3       Rules and Governing Law**

The arbitration will be administered by the AAA in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules then in effect, except as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. The AAA Rules are available at [**https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer\_Rules\_Web\_1.pdf**](https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer_Rules_Web_1.pdf). The rules of the arbitral forum will govern all aspects of the arbitration, except to the extent those rules conflict with these Terms.

Notwithstanding any choice of law or other provision in these Terms, the parties agree and acknowledge that this Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (“FAA”) will govern its interpretation and enforcement and proceedings pursuant thereto. It is the intent of the parties that the FAA and AAA Rules shall preempt all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law. If the FAA and AAA Rules are found to not apply to any issue that arises under this Arbitration Agreement or the enforcement thereof, then that issue shall be resolved under the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.

**21.4       Arbitration Process**

You can begin the arbitration by submitting a Demand for Arbitration, which is a statement containing basic information about the dispute: (a) the names, addresses and phone numbers of the parties involved (you and G Fuel, in most cases); (b) a description of the dispute; and (c) a short statement of the relief you are seeking. The AAA provides a [**Demand for Arbitration form**](https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer_Demand_for_Arbitration_Form_3.pdf) on its website. Or you may contact the AAA at 800-778-7879.

Complete the Demand for Arbitration and make at least four (4) copies. Keep one copy for your records. Send one copy to us by certified mail at Legal Department, Notice of Dispute, ADDRESS: 100 Wireless Blvd, Hauppauge, New York 11788-3955. Send the final two copies of the Demand for Arbitration to the AAA. Please be sure to include (1) a copy of this arbitration provision (you may obtain a copy from these Terms); and (2) the appropriate AAA filing fee. You may obtain the amount of the fee by consulting the AAA's rules. Those rules may be obtained by visiting the [**Consumer section**](https://www.adr.org/consumer) on the AAA's website, or by calling the AAA at 800.778.7879.

Unless you and we agree otherwise in writing, in the event that any provision of this section is found not to apply to you or to a particular claim or dispute as a result of a decision by the Arbitrator or a court order, any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and us must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in Suffolk  County, New York. You and we will submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Suffolk County, New York for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.

**21.5       Arbitrator’s Decision**

The Arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims exclusively in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The Arbitrator will not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving our other users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same user to the extent required by applicable law.

Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the Arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings of fact and conclusions of law on which the award is based. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude the parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of competent jurisdiction. The Arbitrator’s decision shall be final and binding on all parties.

Judgment on any award rendered by the Arbitrator is final, binding and conclusive on you and us and your and our respective administrators, executors, legal representatives, successors and assigns. With the exception of disclosures to affiliates and legal counsel, all negotiations and arbitration proceedings related to a dispute (including a settlement, award, or the documents and briefs exchanged or produced during arbitration) are confidential and may not be disclosed by the parties except to the extent necessary for interim measures or conservatory relief, the enforcement of an arbitration award, or as required by law.

**21.6       Fees**

Payment of all filing, administration and Arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's applicable consumer rules. The parties shall be responsible for their own attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration, unless they are authorized by law or the Arbitrator determines that a claim was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose or in bad faith. In addition, the provisions of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68 shall apply and be enforced by the Arbitrator.

1. **Indemnification**

You agree to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless (as well as our officers, directors, managers, members, employees, contractors, representatives, and agents) from and against any and all losses, damages, settlements, costs, fees, penalties, causes of action, third party claims, expenses, and all other liabilities, including, but not limited to, attorney’s fees and legal costs, arising out of, related to, or in connection with: (i) your use of our Services, or your connection to the Site or App Services; (ii) any material or any other content or information that you submit, post or upload to or transmit through our Services or the App Services; (iii) your violation or breach of any of these Terms or any activity related to your account; (iv) non-payment by you for any of the Services; or (v) your tortious misconduct, including, but not limited to, negligence, wrongful misconduct, fraud, and any other tort or your violation of any law or the rights of any third-party. These obligations will survive any termination of your relationship with us or your use of the Site or our Services.

1. **Severability**

If any portion of these Terms are found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason, (i) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed; (ii) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement; and (iii) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.

1. **Termination**

We may terminate or suspend your access to the Site or our Services at any time without prior notice or liability in our sole discretion for any reason whatsoever, including, but not limited to, your violation of any provision of these Terms.

1. **No Waiver, Entire Agreement and Assignment**

Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. These Terms and any policies or operating rules posted by us on our Services or with respect to our Services constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between you and us and govern your use of our Services, superseding any prior or contemporaneous agreements, communications and proposals, whether oral or written, between you and us (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of the Terms). Any ambiguities in the interpretation of these Terms shall not be construed against the drafting party. You may not assign these Terms or your rights to use all or any portion of our Services without our prior written consent.

1. **Territorial Restrictions**

We control and operate our Services from the United States and we make no representations or warranties that the information, products, or services provided through our Services, are appropriate for access or use in other jurisdictions. You are not permitted to access or use our Services in any jurisdiction or country if it would be contrary to the law or regulation of that jurisdiction or if it would subject us to the laws of, or any registration requirement with, such jurisdiction. We reserve the right to limit the availability of our Services or the provision of any related content, information or materials to any person, geographic area, or jurisdiction, at any time and in our sole and absolute discretion. Each claim or statement about the effectiveness of our products or comparing the effectiveness of our products is expressly limited to the United States, unless otherwise disclosed. WE DO NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT OUR SERVICES OR ANY PART THEREOF ARE APPROPRIATE OR AVAILABLE FOR USE IN ANY PARTICULAR JURISDICTION OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES.

1. **Interpretation**

For purposes of these Terms, (i) the word “_including_”, or any variation thereof means “_including_, _without limitation_” and shall not be construed to limit any general statement that it follows to the specific or similar items or matters immediately following it; (ii) the word "_or_" is not exclusive; and (iii) words denoting the singular have a comparable meaning when used in the plural, and vice-versa. These Terms are drafted in the English language. If these Terms are translated into any other language, the English language text will prevail. The headings used in these Terms are included for convenience only and will not limit or otherwise affect these Terms.

2. **Mobile Terms of Service**

The G FUEL mobile message service (the "Service") is operated by G FUEL (“G FUEL”, “we”, or “us”). Your use of the Service constitutes your agreement to these terms and conditions (“Mobile Terms”). We may modify or cancel the Service or any of its features without notice. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may also modify these Mobile Terms at any time and your continued use of the Service following the effective date of any such changes shall constitute your acceptance of such changes.  
  
By consenting to G FUEL’s SMS/text messaging service, you agree to receive recurring SMS/text messages from and on behalf of G FUEL through your wireless provider to the mobile number you provided, even if your mobile number is registered on any state or federal Do Not Call list. Text messages may be sent using an automatic telephone dialing system or other technology. Service-related messages may include updates, alerts, and information (e.g., order updates, account alerts, etc.). Promotional messages may include promotions, specials, and other marketing offers (e.g., cart reminders).  
You understand that you do not have to sign up for this program in order to make any purchases, and your consent is not a condition of any purchase with G FUEL. Your participation in this program is completely voluntary.  
We do not charge for the Service, but you are responsible for all charges and fees associated with text messaging imposed by your wireless provider. Message frequency varies. Message and data rates may apply. Check your mobile plan and contact your wireless provider for details. You are solely responsible for all charges related to SMS/text messages, including charges from your wireless provider.  
  
You may opt-out of the Service at any time. Text the single keyword command STOP to 96547 or click the unsubscribe link (where available) in any text message to cancel. You'll receive a one-time opt-out confirmation text message. No further messages will be sent to your mobile device, unless initiated by you. If you have subscribed to other G FUEL mobile message programs and wish to cancel, except where applicable law requires otherwise, you will need to opt out separately from those programs by following the instructions provided in their respective mobile terms.
