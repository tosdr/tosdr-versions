### Content Disclaimer: Cautions and Restrictions

We do not control, nor are we responsible for any data, content, services, or products (including software) that you access, download, receive or buy while using the Service. We may, but do not have any obligation to block information, transmissions or access to certain information, services, products or domains to protect the Service, our network, the public or our users. We are not a publisher of third-party content accessed through the Service and are not responsible for the content, accuracy, timeliness or delivery of any opinions, advice, statements, messages, services, graphics, data or any other information provided to or by third parties as accessible through the Service.

You are responsible for paying all fees and charges of any third party vendors whose sites, products or services you access, buy or use via the Service. If you choose to use the Service to access web sites, services or content, or purchase products from third parties, your personal information may be available to the third-party provider. How third parties handle and use your personal information related to their sites and services is governed by their security, privacy and other policies (if any) and not ours. We have no responsibility for third party provider policies, or their or your compliance with them. If you elect to download into your computer or otherwise enable any software, including any "client" designed to facilitate your access of the Service, you shall be solely responsible for, and shall be deemed to have reviewed and, to the extent applicable, acknowledged, accepted or waived, any disclosures, notices or options otherwise made available to you for viewing as part of the log-in process for the Service.

### Service Availability

Actual service coverage, speeds, locations and quality may vary. The Service will attempt to be available at all times except for limited periods for maintenance and repair. However the Service may be subject to unavailability for a variety of factors beyond our control including emergencies, third party service failures, transmission, equipment or network problems or limitations, interference, signal strength, and may be interrupted, refused, limited or curtailed. We are not responsible for data, messages or pages lost, not delivered, delayed or misdirected because of interruptions or performance issues with the Service or communications services or networks (e.g., T-1 lines or the Internet). We may impose usage or Service limits, suspend Service, or block certain kinds of usage in our sole discretion to protect users or the Service. Network speed is an estimate and is no indication of the speed at which your or the Service sends or receives data. Actual network speed will vary based on configuration, compression, network congestion and other factors. The accuracy and timeliness of data received is not guaranteed; delays or omissions may occur.

### Account Policies

Account Holder purchases payment points which are transferred to his balance. Payment points can not be tranfered to another account balance. Service access period can be extended by consuming payment points from Account Holder balance.

Extended time is accounted on a continuous calendar basis, not on a timed use basis. Extending access for 24 hours means that Account Holder can access the [Seed4.Me](https://seed4.me/) service for 24 hours period. It does not mean that the Account Holder can access the [Seed4.Me](https://seed4.me/) service for 24 hours of connected time (unless that 24 hours is in the 24 hours period).

Account Holder is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of his/her password and is liable for any harm resulting from disclosing or allowing disclosure of any password. In the event of a breach of security, Account Holder will remain liable for any unauthorized use of the [Seed4.Me](https://seed4.me/) Service until Account Holder notifies [Seed4.Me](https://seed4.me/).

Account Holder can cancel their account at any time, but remaining balance will not be refunded to them back. However payment points purchase can be refunded unless user extended access period, after the last time payment was done.

[Seed4.Me](https://seed4.me/) reserves the right to terminate an account immediately for violating any section of this agreement. In this case, no any refund is possible. [Seed4.Me](https://seed4.me/) can cancel an account at any time by providing notice to the Account Holder.

The user is responsible for all charges (e.g. HotSpot access fees, in-room network fees) and equipment (e.g. wireless card, cables) associated with connecting to the [Seed4.Me](https://seed4.me/) service.
