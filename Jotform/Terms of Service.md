Terms of Use
============

These Terms of Use (“Terms”) apply to all Starter, Bronze, Silver, and Gold [users](https://www.jotform.com/pricing/) of the Jotform form-building platform (the “Platform”), and to all parties who visit the Jotform website (“Website”) at www.jotform.com. As used in these Terms, “You” and “you” includes all such parties, whether they are acting on their own behalf, or  on behalf of or as part of a company or other entity.

By visiting the Website or using the Platform, you are representing and affirming that you have read, understand, and agreed that you are bound by these Terms, and of legal age to accept and agree to these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you are not permitted to use the Jotform Platform.

The terms “we”, “us” and “our” used below refer to Jotform.

If you are an enterprise user or you obtained a subscription or right to use the Platform from a third party authorized to do so by Jotform, these terms do not apply to you.

1\. Who May Use the Platform / Subscriptions
--------------------------------------------

Except for our free Starter version of the Jotform Platform, your right to use the Platform depends on you timely paying the required fees. Bronze, Silver and Gold users obtain a subscription to use the Platform once they pay; free/Starter users obtain no subscription but may still use the Platform. All users must comply with these terms.

You agree to use the Platform only as permitted in these Terms. 

2\. Things You May Not Do Regarding the Platform
------------------------------------------------

You accept and assume sole responsibility for your use of the Platform.

You may not share your log-in info/credentials or otherwise allow anyone else to use them to access the Platform.

You agree that you will always comply with all applicable laws in connection with your use of the Platform. This means not violating any applicable law, legal right or protection, including but not limited to third parties’ privacy rights and intellectual property rights.

The Platform may NOT be used for, or in connection with any of the following, any or all of which may result in your account being temporarily suspended or permanently terminated, at our sole discretion:

* Email solicitation, Mass Emailing, Spamming, Phishing, and the like
* Violating anyone’s privacy rights
* Financial/monetary fraud or schemes
* Computer fraud or other computer crimes
* Defamation, discrimination, or harassment
* Funding, encouraging, or facilitating any criminal or other illegal activities
* Promoting, encouraging, or requesting any form of violence or harm to anyone
* Collecting any of the following: credit card information, highly-sensitive information such as log-in credentials for other sites or platforms
* Forms that include fields for the submitter to provide the personal information of any third party where the submitter does not have the permission of the third party to provide such information
* Promoting products or services on social media platforms or other websites where such actions violate the terms of use or community guidelines of such platforms or websites 
* Including a third party’s copyrighted or trademarked content or trade secrets in your form(s) without that party’s permission
* Encouraging violence, bullying, or harm to others
* Gathering, collecting, or asking for or suggesting that form submitters provide pornographic or sexually explicit content, or promoting or encouraging prostitution or other activities involving the exchange of sexual services as part of any transaction
* Any other activity prohibited under these Terms or under applicable law

You agree that we have the absolute and unconditional right to remove any form that we believe is being or has been used or offered in connection with any of the above prohibited purposes or activities, or that we believe may be construed by others as doing any of these things. In cases where we remove a form, we may at our sole discretion also disable your access to any past or future submissions to such forms.

You and your agents hereby forever release Jotform from any and all responsibility for any and all wrongs and violations of our terms or of the law committed by you relating to your use of the Platform.

You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, reverse engineer, copy, sell, resell, or exploit for any commercial purposes the Platform or any portion thereof or the offer or sell the right to use the Platform.

3\. Forms and Submissions
-------------------------

You accept and have sole responsibility for the forms, tables, submission pages, and other content that you create or that is generated as you use the Platform. When you make such content “public”, or set your account settings to allow the content to become public, or you don’t change a default setting that would allow a form, a table or other content that is generated as you use the Platform to be made public, you acknowledge and agree that the content will in fact be available to the public on our websites. By allowing such content to become public, you grant Jotform a worldwide and fully sublicensable license to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, publicly perform, and publicly display such content on our websites. Of course, you may choose to apply settings to your account to make or keep forms private. 

You agree that you will not assert any copyright claim or other intellectual property claims or rights in forms you build or create using the Platform against Jotform, and that you waive any such legal claims against Jotform relating to such forms. This includes whole forms and parts of such forms. You acknowledge and agree that Jotform may display your forms on our websites and platforms, and that we may use your forms for the purposes of improving the form builder, for learning about how you and other people use, build, and create and submit forms, for teaching our staff, systems, and products about such matters, and for other purposes.

4\. Account Creation & Security
-------------------------------

You must provide a valid email address and any other information requested in order to fully complete the signup process and create a login. You may only create a separate login for as many Users as your current Jotform plan allows. The sharing of your Jotform Account login credentials is strictly prohibited. You are responsible for maintaining the security of each User’s account, username and password and for ensuring that each User associated with your Jotform Account complies with these Terms. You may not access the Jotform Platform through automated methods, such as using bots or computer code to call or ping the Platform or our website. If you require a multi-user plan, please [contact Jotform Enterprise](https://www.jotform.com/enterprise/contact-sales/) for assistance.

5\. Payments, Renewals, etc
---------------------------

**A**. **Payments**. We charge sales taxes on subscriptions where we are required to do so under applicable law. No other taxes will be charged. You are responsible for payment of any and all taxes, levies, and duties, including any sale or value-added taxes and similar taxes and duties, that may be imposed on you by any governing authority in any jurisdiction in connection with your subscription.

Jotform offers payments through third-party payment processors. By making payments to us for Jotform services, you indicate that you have reviewed these Terms and the privacy policy of the payment processor that processes your payment to us.

If you use a credit card to pay for your Jotform subscription, you represent and warrant that the credit card information you provide is correct and that you will promptly notify us of any changes to such credit card information. You agree that if your credit card payment cannot be processed for any reason, Jotform may suspend or cancel your Jotform subscription.

**B**. **Automatic Renewal**. For subscriptions, you will be billed in advance on a recurring, periodic basis. Your Jotform subscription will automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle until you cancel your subscription or you downgrade to a free/Starter plan – see [this page](https://www.jotform.com/help/chapter-10-billing/) and the Billing section in your Account Settings. You may also send us a request to downgrade to the Starter plan [here](https://www.jotform.com/contact/). Turning off auto-renew prevents your payment method from being charged at your next billing date, or if you pay by invoice, prevents your next invoice from being issued.

**C**. **Upgrades/Downgrades.** Upgrading your plan, such as going from a free Starter plan to a Bronze plan, or from Bronze to Silver or Silver to Gold, will add or increase things like the included/allowed number of included forms, submissions, available space, storage, etc. Downgrading your plan will, as of your next billing date, result in a decrease of some or all of those elements and may cause you to lose forms and submissions. You can delete your account entirely by clicking “Delete My Account” on your Account Settings page.

**D**. **30 Day Money Back Policy.** If for any reason you decide to cancel your account within 30 days of your payment made directly to Jotform, you are eligible for a refund – please submit your request to the [Jotform Support Team](https://www.jotform.com/contact/). If you purchased your Jotform subscription through the Google Play app or website, see [this page](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2479637?hl=en) for how to submit your refund request to Google.

Subscriptions purchased via the Apple App Store are subject to the Apple App Store refund policies – Jotform cannot refund payment(s) you made to Apple. To request a refund, please review Apple’s refund process: [https://support.apple.com/HT204084](https://support.apple.com/HT204084).
