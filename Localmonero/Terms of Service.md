It is a condition of use of this site that all the details you provide will be correct, current, and complete. If we at LocalMonero.co believe the details are not correct, current, or complete, we have the right to refuse you access to the site, or any of its resources, and to terminate or suspend your account. You may only act on your own behalf. Your account can not be used to act as an intermediary or broker for any person or entity. You may only use your own account to trade at LocalMonero.co and you may only use one user account at a time for trading. You are responsible for maintaining adequate security and control of any and all IDs, passwords, personal identification numbers (PINs), or any other codes that you use to access LocalMonero. You are not allowed to sell, borrow, share or otherwise make available your account or any detail necessary to access your account to people or entities other than yourself. Your account must not contain misleading or fraudulent information, including, but not limited to having a non-personal phone number, creating fake reputation information for your account, faking your country of origin or providing fraudulent identification documents. We may at any time require you to complete our ID verification process and may also require you to submit additional identification documents to LocalMonero if we deem it necessary. Failing to complete ID verification will be considered a violation of this agreement. We may close (upon which the account's Monero arbitration bond and fee balance will be forfeited), suspend, or limit your access to your account or to other Services we offer, and/or limit access to your Monero arbitration bond and fee balance for up to 180 days (or longer if pursuant to a court order or other legal process) if we consider that you are using the LocalMonero platform to scam other users or for any other unlawful purpose, or if we receive reports that you are communicating unlawful or defamatory messages to other users, or if LocalMonero is required by law to do so, or if you violate these Terms of Service or any other agreement you enter into with LocalMonero, or as otherwise specified in these Terms of Service or other agreement you have entered into with LocalMonero, or for any other reason in our absolute discretion. If you do not login to your account for over 180 days, your account and its Monero arbitration bond and fee balance will be considered as forfeited. We may also use proprietary fraud and risk modeling when assessing the risk associated with your account, high risk users are deemed to be in violation of this agreement. If we determine that you have at any previous point in time violated this agreement or any other agreement that you have entered into with us we will immediately close, suspend or limit your account and Monero arbitration bond and fee balance as per the terms outlined in this agreement.

A Customer shall not: (1) allow any other person to use their account for any reason; (2) use the Service to directly send value (i.e. cryptocurrency) to any other person; (3) use the Service to directly receive value (i.e. cryptocurrency) from any other person; or (4) create an account using the information of another person.

7\. Advertisements and trading
------------------------------

With a registered account you can create Monero trade advertisements ("advertisement" or "ad" or "ads") to advertise that you are purchasing or selling Monero. You may initiate Monero trades ("trades" or "contacts") by contacting advertisements created by other users or wait for users to initiate trades with you by contacting ads created by yourself. By initiating a Monero trade you agree to be bound by the advertisers terms of trade ("advertisers terms") set forth by the advertiser and displayed as terms of trade on the advertisement page. The terms of trade as determined by the advertiser are valid in all cases except when the advertisers terms contradict the LocalMonero Terms of Service or are illegal or if both parties of the trade consent to alter the terms of trade. The price or price equation that is defined in the advertisement must contain any and all fees that the advertiser requires the user initiating the trade to pay. After initiation of a trade the Monero price is locked and cannot be changed or any additional fees added without consent from both parties of the trade and LocalMonero.co. Monero advertisements must be placed in the correct payment category, if a category does not exist for the payment method it must be placed in the Other category. We may hide, remove, or limit your advertisements, if you violate these Terms of Service or any other agreement you enter into with LocalMonero, or as otherwise specified in these Terms of Service or other agreement you have entered into with LocalMonero. Valid payment details must be provided through the LocalMonero trade system. It is a violation of this terms of service to provide payment details through other communication channels. In case a payment made by a Monero buyer to a seller is frozen, held, reversed, charged back or in other ways withheld from the Monero seller the buyer will be considered in breach of these terms of service. User information of the buyer can be provided to the seller to assist in recovery of the funds. Monero in an amount equal to the amount of the trade must be held in an arbitration bond during the whole trade process until the seller has received payment in full. Monero buyers must be able to, upon request by LocalMonero, provide adequate proof of payment for up to 180 days after the trade has been completed. We use proprietary fraud and risk modeling when assessing the risk associated with your account, your ads and your trades. If we find your account to pose a high risk to LocalMonero or our customers we will consider you in breach of these terms of service and may temporarily limit your account and freeze your Monero arbitration bond and fee wallet in accordance with these terms of service. We do not have any bank accounts that hold users' funds, nor do we facilitate or escrow any local currency payments between buyers and sellers. Trades are settled between unhosted wallets and accounts that directly belong to the trade parties.

Local Cash advertisements
-------------------------

Local Cash advertisements ("Local ads" or "Local Advertisements" or "Cash advertisements") are advertisements in the categories "Buy Monero locally" and "Sell Monero locally" or any other advertisement where the payment method is specified as cash or where the advertisement type is local sell or local buy. You are allowed to have active ads with only one account at a time. Multiple ads per city are not allowed unless the ads are limited to different customer groups and have a price difference of at least 3 %.

Online advertisements
---------------------

Online advertisements ("Online ads" or "Online advertisements") are advertisements in the categories "Buy Monero online" and "Sell Monero online" or any other advertisement where the payment method is any other than cash or the advertisement type is online buy or online sell. You are allowed to have active ads with only one account at a time. You must place your ads in the correct payment category. Multiple ads for the same payment method are not allowed in the same country unless the ads are limited to certain customer groups.

8\. Accounts verified as company
--------------------------------

A user account can be verified as a company account. Accounts that are company verified are allowed the following exemptions from these terms: A company may have several active user accounts at any time, provided they are all company verified and operated by an employee of the company. Each company verified account is personal to the employee operating it. A company may have active advertisements from several accounts with the following exceptions: Ads are not allowed to overlap between accounts. E.g. you’re not allowed to create advertisements using the same limits with the same price in the same payment method category in the same country. Multiple advertisements for the same payment method in the same country are not allowed if they have the same price and don’t have at least one of the following differences: Minimum and Maximum transaction limit is not allowed to overlap.

9\. Disputes with Monero trades
-------------------------------

If the buyer and seller of a Monero trade are in disagreement over a trade either party or LocalMonero may initiate a dispute. Disputed trades are resolved by LocalMonero.co support staff. LocalMonero.co support resolves disputes by carefully evaluating the terms of trade, payment evidence, trade chat messages, user reputation, other data submitted to us by our users and data collected by us as part of the privacy policy. LocalMonero will review the evidence and it will direct the cryptocurrency from the arbitration bond to the party who in LocalMonero's reasonable opinion is entitled to own it under the terms of trade. When sellers turn unresponsive, we will resolve the dispute to the buyer if we are confident the seller has received valid payment from the buyer. If the buyer is unresponsive the seller may dispute the trade and we will resolve the dispute to the seller. After the trade has been finalized by the seller, cancelled by the buyer or automatically cancelled due to not being marked as paid the trade is considered finished and cannot be disputed, reversed or altered. Providing fraudulent information or documents in a dispute or making false claims or otherwise trying to force a certain outcome of a disputed trade is considered a violation of this agreement. If payment details are provided outside of LocalMonero the dispute may be resolved without taking the payment details into consideration. The parties agree that except in cases of gross negligence or fraud, LocalMonero's decision is final and binding on the parties and there is no appeal from such decision.
