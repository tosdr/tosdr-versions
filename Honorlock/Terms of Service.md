TERMS OF SERVICE – EXAM TAKER



Last Updated: May, 2021



Honorlock Inc. (“Honorlock,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) provides you access to one or more of our

online test proctoring applications and browser extensions (each, an “App”), and the proctoring

services we provide through the Apps (together with the Apps, the “Services”), subject to the

following terms and conditions of service (the “Exam Taker Agreement”). The term “you” applies

to any person that takes an exam that is proctored with our Services.



Honorlock provides the Services pursuant to our agreement with your Testing Organization (as

defined below). Please review our Exam Taker Privacy Notice, available at

https://honorlock.com/legal/app_privacy, for details about how we process the information we

collect about you in connection with the Services.



By taking any exam that utilizes our Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood,

and agree to be legally bound by this Exam Taker Agreement. If you do not agree to any of the

terms of the Exam Taker Agreement, then you are not authorized to install any App or otherwise

use any of our Services.



The section below titled “Dispute Resolution; Binding Arbitration” contains a binding

arbitration agreement and class action waiver. They affect your legal rights. Please read

them.



We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify, discontinue, or terminate the Services, or

to modify the Exam Taker Agreement, at any time. If we modify the Exam Taker Agreement, we

will provide notice to you by posting the modification on our website at https://honorlock.com/,

through the download page where you can install an App, and we may also provide you with

additional notice of the modification at the last email address you provided to us. If you continue

to access or use our Services after we have provided notice of the modified Exam Taker

Agreement, you are indicating that you agree to be bound by the modified Exam Taker

Agreement. If the modified Exam Taker Agreement is not acceptable to you, your only recourse

is to cease using the Services. Unless changes are made to the arbitration and class action

waiver provision under Section 12, you agree that modification of this Exam Taker Agreement

does not create a new right to opt out of arbitration.



1. APP AND SERVICES DESCRIPTION



(a) Our Services assist organizations (each, a “Testing Organization”) in offering online

examinations (each, an “Exam”). Organizations that desire to use our proctoring

Services must subscribe to our Services by contracting with Honorlock directly. When a

professor, instructor, or administrator from the Testing Organization (the “Administrator”)

desires to offer an Exam online, the Administrator administers such online Exams via its

learning management system, such as Blackboard, Canvas, or Desire2Learn (each, an

“LMS”). Our Services are designed to integrate with the LMS so that Honorlock’s

proctors (each, a “Proctor”) can view the established settings of the Exam, help exam



Copyright 2021 Honorlock Inc. All rights reserved.

takers take the Exam (each, an “Exam Taker”) and monitor for suspected misconduct.



(b) As an Exam Taker, you will need to follow the instructions provided by Honorlock, the

applicable LMS and your Testing Organization (or Administrator) prior to starting the

Exam, including installing any required Apps. For instance, you may be required to login

to an LMS account or use a specific web browser in order to access your Exam.

Honorlock is not associated with or responsible for, and does not endorse, any

third-party website or service you use in connection with the Services, including, without

limitation, the provider of your browser or device, any Testing Organization, or any LMS.

purpose of taking any exam that utilizes our Services.

Organization;



● You will not use any robot, spider, scraper, or other automated means to access or

scrape any of the Services for any purpose; and

determine that there was any attempt to take any action in breach of this Exam

Taker Agreement.



3. AUTHENTICATION; ENABLING DEVICES; AUTHORIZATION



(a) When you use the Services in order to take your Exam, you may be required to enable

certain features on your device, such as the camera and microphone, to take certain

recordings or allow our Services to take certain audio or visual recordings. If you allow

our Services to have access to your device camera or microphone, then you authorize

us to access your device camera and microphone to take audio and visual recordings,

and process those recordings to provide our Services to your Testing Organization. You

acknowledge and agree that when we process these recordings, (i) we may collect

information about the test taker’s face and voice to determine whether there are other

people in the room and what words they are speaking (without trying to identify any



Copyright 2021 Honorlock Inc. All rights reserved.

particular person); (ii) we may use this information solely to provide our Services to the

Testing Organization and (iii) we may store this information for one year unless otherwise

requested by the organization and in no event longer than three years after your last

interaction with our Services.



(b) As part of the Services requested by your Testing Organization, you may also be

required to download an App designed to detect and block your use of prohibited

applications during an Exam. This App may send information regarding suspected usage

of a prohibited application on your device and may cause your device to force close the

prohibited application. By downloading this App, you authorize us to access your device

via the App for these purposes. For more details on how we process information about

you via our Services, please see our privacy policy

(https://honorlock.com/legal/app_privacy).



(c) If another person takes an exam that utilizes our Services through the same device onto

which you have installed an App, then, before they begin such exam, you will (i) provide

notice to them of our privacy policy and any other privacy notices displayed via our

Services, (ii) ensure that they agree to this Exam Taker Agreement, and (iii) ensure that

they provide all consents requested through the Services. The foregoing obligation will

not apply if we are able to obtain any such agreements and consents, and provide any

such notices, directly from/to that other user.



4. PROCTORING DURING THE EXAM



(a) Proctors have the ability to pause your Exam and to communicate with you directly via

live chat, such as in the event of suspected misconduct. A Proctor may also inform the

Testing Organization and Administrator of activities occurring through the Services,

including suspected misconduct. Please be advised that when an Exam is paused by a

Proctor, you may not recover the lost time. Please contact your Testing Organization for

more information about its Exam and proctoring policies.



(b) Honorlock offers certain additional features and functionalities to Testing Organizations

and Administrators for added proctoring and Exam protection, such as “seed sites” that

are designed to detect Exam Takers attempting to cheat using a secondary device. You

do not have the ability to enable or disable these additional features and functionalities,

and you may not know whether or not these features and functionalities are running

during your Exam.



(c) We urge you to assume that such features are always enabled, so you should

never use another device to engage in any prohibited activity, including to search

the Internet for your Exam (or for answers to your Exam) while you are taking the

Exam.



5. SUPPORT; FEEDBACK



Copyright 2021 Honorlock Inc. All rights reserved.

(a) If you are having technical difficulties with the Services at any time, or if you have

questions about our Services, you may email us or utilize our live chat support using the

contact information on our website at https://www.honorlock.com/support.



(b) If you share any feedback with Honorlock or its personnel, including, but not limited to,

questions, comments, suggestions, ideas, or techniques about Honorlock or our

Services, then we shall be free to use any such feedback for any purpose whatsoever,

including but not limited to, the development, production, and marketing of products and

services that incorporate such feedback, without compensation or attribution to you, in

accordance with your Testing Organization’s agreement with Honorlock.



(c) It is important to us that our support and proctoring staff is treated with respect.

Please use good judgment and appropriate verbiage when interacting with our

staff. If we determine, in our sole discretion, that your behavior is inappropriate or

disrespectful, Honorlock reserves the right to immediately end the support

session, and, in its sole discretion, to ban you from using our services in the

future.



6. OUR DISCLAIMER; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY



(a) You acknowledge that although the Services and other information or materials

provided by Honorlock can be used as aids to Testing Organizations and

Administrators to make decisions about suspected misconduct, the Testing

Organization and Administrators are solely responsible for determining whether

any misconduct has occurred and the decisions made about any suspected

misconduct. If an Exam Taker desires to contest an allegation of misconduct, they

should raise their concern directly with the Testing Organization or Administrator,

and not to Honorlock. Honorlock does not guarantee or endorse the accuracy,

completeness, or reliability of any Services or any information or materials

provided by Honorlock to you or to the Testing Organization.



(b) Your use of the Services and your devices while taking an Exam is at your own

risk.



(c) You acknowledge that the Services may contain bugs, errors, and other problems

that could cause system failures. The Services and all other information and

materials provided by Honorlock are provided “as is” and “as available,” and

Honorlock makes no representations or warranties with respect to the same or

otherwise in connection with this Exam Taker Agreement, and hereby disclaims

any and all express, implied, or statutory warranties, including, without limitation,

any warranties of non-infringement, merchantability, fitness for a particular

purpose, availability, error-free or uninterrupted operation, and any warranties

arising from a course of dealing, course of performance, or usage of trade.



Copyright 2021 Honorlock Inc. All rights reserved.

(d) We and our affiliates and our and their respective officers, directors, employees,

agents, successors, licensees, licensors, and assigns (the “Honorlock Parties”)

shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental or consequential damages, lost

profits, or damages resulting from your access to or use of the Services,

including, without limitation any lost data resulting from the use or inability to

access and use the Services or any website, even if we have been advised of the

possibility of such damages. Additionally, the Honorlock Parties shall not be

liable for any direct damages that you may suffer as a result of your use of the

Services in excess of one hundred U.S. dollars ($100).



(e) No cause of action arising under statute, tort, contract, or warranty related to the

Services, or otherwise arising under this Exam Taker Agreement, regardless of

form, may be brought by you more than one (1) year after such action has

accrued.



(f) Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain warranties;

therefore, some of the above limitations in this section may not apply to you.

Nothing in this Exam Taker Agreement shall affect any non-waivable statutory rights that

apply to you.



7. INDEMNIFICATION



You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold the Honorlock Parties harmless from and against any

damages, liabilities, losses, expenses, claims, actions, and/or demands, including, without

limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising or resulting from: (i) your breach of this

Exam Taker Agreement; (ii) your misuse of the Services; and/or (iii) your violation of any

third-party rights, including without limitation any copyright, trademark, property, publicity, or

privacy right. We shall provide notice to you of any such claim, suit, or proceeding and shall

assist you, at your expense, in defending any such claim, suit, or proceeding. We reserve the

right to assume the exclusive defense and control (at your expense) of any matter that is subject

to indemnification under this section. In such case, you agree to cooperate with any reasonable

requests assisting our defense of such matter.

foreign laws. Unauthorized use of the Content may violate copyright, trademark, and

other laws.

service marks of Honorlock. Other company, product, and service names located on the

Services may be trademarks or service marks owned by others (the “Third-Party

Trademarks,” and, collectively with Honorlock Trademarks, the “Trademarks”). Nothing

on the Services should be construed as granting, by implication, estoppel, or otherwise,

any license or right to use the Trademarks, without Honorlock’s prior written permission

specific for each such use. Use of the Trademarks as part of a link to or from any site is

prohibited unless establishment of such a link is approved in advance by us in writing. All

by any means, including, but not limited to, the use of framing or mirrors. None of the

Content may be retransmitted without our express, written consent for each and every

instance.



9. COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS



The Services are based in the United States. We make no claims concerning whether the

Services may be accessed, downloaded, viewed, or be appropriate for use outside of the United

States. If you access the Services from outside of the United States, you do so at your own risk.

Whether inside or outside of the United States, you are solely responsible for ensuring

compliance with the laws of your specific jurisdiction.



10\. TERMINATION OF THE EXAM TAKER AGREEMENT



We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to restrict, suspend, or terminate the Exam Taker

Agreement and your access to all or any part of the Services, at any time and for any reason

without prior notice or liability. We reserve the right to change, suspend, or discontinue all or any

part of the Services at any time without prior notice or liability. Sections 5-14 shall survive the

termination of this Exam Taker Agreement.



11\. CONTROLLING LAW



This Exam Taker Agreement and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the

State of Delaware without regard to the conflict of law rules or principles of any other

jurisdiction.



Copyright 2021 Honorlock Inc. All rights reserved.

12\. DISPUTE RESOLUTION; BINDING ARBITRATION



Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain

disputes and claims with Honorlock and limits the manner in which you can seek relief

from us, unless you opt out of arbitration by following the instructions set forth below.

No class or representative actions or arbitrations are allowed under this arbitration

agreement. In addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury

trial.



a) No Representative Actions. You and Honorlock agree that any dispute arising out

of or related to this Exam Taker Agreement or our Services is personal to you and

Honorlock and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual action,

and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of

representative proceeding.



b) Arbitration of Disputes. Except for small claims disputes in which you or Honorlock

seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county of your

billing address or disputes in which you or Honorlock seeks injunctive or other equitable

relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, you and Honorlock waive

your rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to this

Exam Taker Agreement or our Services resolved in court. Instead, for any dispute or

claim that you have against Honorlock or relating in any way to the Services, you agree

to first contact Honorlock and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written

notice of your claim (“Notice”) to Honorlock by email at privacy@honorlock.com. The

Notice must (a) include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone

number; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim; and (c) set forth the specific relief

sought. Our notice to you will be similar in form to that described above. If you and

Honorlock cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after

such Notice is received, then either party may submit the dispute to binding arbitration

administered by JAMS or, under the limited circumstances set forth below, in court. All

disputes submitted to JAMS will be resolved through confidential, binding arbitration

before one arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings will be conducted telephonically or via

video conference, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and

Procedures (“JAMS Rules”), unless the arbitrator determines that an in-person hearing is

appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location that is reasonably

convenient to both parties. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the arbitrator

will determine the location. The most recent version of the JAMS Rules are available on

the JAMS website and are hereby incorporated by reference. You either acknowledge

and agree that you have read and understand the JAMS Rules or waive your opportunity

to read the JAMS Rules and waive any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or should

not apply for any reason.



c) You and Honorlock agree that the terms of this Exam Taker Agreement affect interstate

commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 12 will be substantively and



Copyright 2021 Honorlock Inc. All rights reserved.

procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the “FAA”), to

the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, this Exam Taker

Agreement and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all

procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to grant any remedy

that would otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the question

of arbitrability. The arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not

consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or

representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one

individual.



d) The arbitrator, Honorlock, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any arbitration

proceedings, judgments and awards, including, but not limited to, all information

gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the

dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to

safeguard confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of

confidentiality does not apply to the extent that disclosure is necessary to prepare for or

conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a

preliminary remedy or in connection with a judicial challenge to an arbitration award or its

enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure is otherwise required by law or judicial

decision.



e) You and Honorlock agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee

and Honorlock will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated

by Honorlock, Honorlock will pay all JAMS fees and costs.



f) Any claim arising out of or related to this Exam Taker Agreement or our Services

must be filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, the claim is

permanently barred, which means that you and Honorlock will not have the right

to assert the claim.



g) You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of the date you

first accepted the terms of this Section 12 by emailing us at

privacy@honorlock.com. In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must include your

full name and address and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By

opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve disputes in accordance with

Section 13.



h) If any portion of this Section 12 is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any reason,

(i) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from this Exam Taker

Agreement; (ii) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no

impact whatsoever on the remainder of this Section 12 or the parties’ ability to compel

arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Section 12;

and (iii) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective,

consolidated, or representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of



Copyright 2021 Honorlock Inc. All rights reserved.

competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those

claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in arbitration.

Further, if any part of this Section 12 is found to prohibit an individual claim seeking

public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect to the extent such relief is

allowed to be sought out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section 12 will be

enforceable.



13\. EQUITABLE RELIEF; GOVERNING LAW



You acknowledge and agree that in the event of a breach or threatened violation of our

intellectual property rights and confidential and proprietary information by you, we will suffer

irreparable harm and will therefore be entitled to injunctive relief to enforce this Exam Taker

Agreement. We may, without waiving any other remedies under this Exam Taker Agreement,

seek from any court having jurisdiction any interim, equitable, provisional, or injunctive relief that

is necessary to protect our rights and property pending the outcome of the arbitration referenced

above. You hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent to the personal and subject

matter jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the State of Delaware for purposes of

any such action by us or any other claim not subject to arbitration (for reasons described

in Section 12(h) above).



14\. MISCELLANEOUS



(a) Our failure to act on or enforce any provision of this Exam Taker Agreement shall not be

construed as a waiver of that provision or any other provision in this Exam Taker

Agreement. No waiver shall be effective against us unless expressly waived by us in

writing, and no such waiver shall be construed as a waiver in any other or subsequent

instance. Except as expressly agreed by us and you in writing, this Exam Taker

Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and us with respect to the

subject matter set forth therein, and supersedes all previous or contemporaneous

agreements, whether written or oral, between the parties with respect to the subject

matter.



(b) If any provision or part of a provision of this Exam Taker Agreement is unlawful, void or

unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from this

Exam Taker Agreement and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any

remaining provisions.



(c) The section headings are provided merely for convenience and shall not be given any

legal import. This Exam Taker Agreement may not be transferred, assigned or delegated

by you, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent, and any

attempted transfer, assignment or delegation without such consent will be void and

without effect. We may freely transfer, assign or delegate this Exam Taker Agreement, in

whole or in part, without your prior written consent. This Exam Taker Agreement will

inure to the benefit of our successors, assigns, licensees, and sublicensees.
