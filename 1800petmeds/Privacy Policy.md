Mailing list

When you make a purchase or register an account, you are automatically enrolled in our mailing lists, or you may request that we add you to our mailing list. If at any time you do not want to receive offers and/or circulars from us you can remove yourself from our mailing lists by emailing us at [customerservice@1800petmeds.com](mailto:customerservice@1800petmeds.com) with "NO GROUND MAIL" in the subject line along with your name, and address. Please note that our mailings are prepared in advance of their being sent. Although we will remove your name from our mailing list after receiving your request, you may still receive mailings from us that had been initiated prior to your name being removed.

Third-Party applications/websites

When you click on links on our online store, they may direct you away from our website. In addition, our website may offer social sharing features and other integrated tools (such as the Facebook "Like" button), which let you share actions you take on our website with other media. Your use of such features enables the sharing of information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the entity that provides the social sharing feature. Our Privacy Policy does not cover any third party services or entities that provide social sharing features except as described in this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for and have no control over the privacy practices of other websites or applications that we do not own. To learn about those third parties' privacy practices, please read their privacy policies.

U.S. law applies

Our website is intended for users located in the United States. By sending us your personal information from outside the U.S., you consent to the application of U.S. law and to the use and disclosure of your personal information consistent with this Privacy Policy. It is up to you to determine whether accessing our website and purchasing our products are legal where you are. You access our website and purchase our products at your own risk, and you are responsible for compliance with all applicable laws, rules, regulations and treaties. Further, by choosing to visit our online store, you agree that any dispute over privacy or the terms contained in this Privacy Policy will be governed by the law of the State of Florida, without reference to the choice of law or conflicts of law principles thereof.

Changes to this privacy policy

We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the bottom of this Privacy Policy, so please review it frequently. Changes and clarifications will take effect immediately upon their posting on our website. PetMeds encourages you to check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy whenever you access the website or otherwise interact with us.

Accessibility

Accessibility, diversity and inclusion are important values at PetMeds. It is the goal of PetMeds and its affiliates for our website and mobile application to be accessible to all. We are continually working to conform our website, to the extent possible, to the standards set out in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) or other standards to the extent required by the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"). Please be aware that our efforts are ongoing. If, at any time, you have specific questions or concerns about the accessibility of any particular page on our website or if you have any difficulty accessing or using our website, please email us at [customerservice@1800petmeds.com](mailto:customerservice@1800petmeds.com) or call us toll-free at [1-800-PetMeds](#) (1-800-738-6337). We will make all reasonable efforts to work with you to identify the issue and make our website accessible to you.

Nevada privacy rights

Under Nevada law, certain Nevada consumers may opt out of the “sale” of “personally identifiable information” as such terms are defined under Nevada law. We do not engage in such activity; however, if you are a Nevada resident who has purchased goods or services from us, you may submit a request to opt out of any potential future sales under Nevada law by contacting us at [customerservice@1800petmeds.com](mailto:customerservice@1800petmeds.com) or call us toll-free at [1-800-PetMeds](#) (1-800-738-6337). We will take reasonable steps to verify your identity and the authenticity of the request. Once verified, we will maintain your request in the event our practices change.

California privacy rights

Consumers residing in California have certain additional rights with respect to their personal information under the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA") and the "Shine the Light" Law. The California “Shine the Light” law gives residents of California the right under certain circumstances to request information from us regarding the manner in which we share certain categories of personal information (as defined in the Shine the Light law) with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We do not share your personal information with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes. The CCPA provides California residents with the right to not be discriminated against (as provided for in applicable law) for exercising rights to access and delete your personal information. As a California resident, you have the right to request a report of the information we collect about you, from whom it has been obtained, and the categories of business with which we share the information. This information is provided in this Privacy Policy in the sections above.

You have the right to request:

* The specific categories of personal information we have collected about you during the previous 12 months;
* The specific personal information we have collected about you during the previous 12 months, depending upon verification of your identity or verification of the person authorized to act on your behalf;
* The categories of personal information we have disclosed to third parties about you along with the categories of the organizations receiving that information during the previous 12 months;
* The deletion of your personal information, subject to several exemptions available to us.

Please note that PetMeds does not sell personal information or customer data regardless of the state in which the customer resides.

California residents may request a report of their personal information collected by us and how it has been used and shared with third parties, or request data deletion by emailing us at [customerservice@1800petmeds.com](mailto: customerservice@1800petmeds.com) or call us toll-free at [1-800-PetMeds](#) (1-800-738-6337).

For additional information concerning CCPA, please send a detailed email to [ccpa@1800petmeds.com](mailto:ccpa@1800petmeds.com).

To opt out of email communications or the use of data at a browser level, you may make your selections [here](https://www.1800petmeds.com/email-preferences).

Prior to honoring your request, the Company will make a reasonable attempt to verify your identity. You may designate an authorized agent to make a request not to disclose or to delete your personal information by providing the authorized agent written permission to do so and by verifying your own identity with us. The Company will not discriminate against you if you take advantage of these rights.
