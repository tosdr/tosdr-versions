**Exclusion of return policy**  
The right to return does not apply to contracts:

* if the delivered goods are newspapers, periodicals or magazines with the exception of subscription contracts,
* if the goods are not prefabricated and whose production is based on individual selection or provision by the consumer, or if the goods are clearly tailored to the personal needs of the consumer,
* if the products delivered are sealed goods that are not suitable for return for reasons of health or hygiene, if their seal has been removed after delivery,
* if after their delivery, the goods were inseparably mixed with other goods due to the nature of the products.

* Your payment information is not correct or verifiable;
* Your order or customer account is flagged by our security system as being unusual or fraudulent;
* You are a reseller;
* The displayed price in our online shop was incorrect;
* We are unable to deliver to the address provided;
* We are unable to provide service due to events that are out of our control.

#### 10\. Liability

For negligent breaches of the contract's main obligations, our liability is limited to average foreseeable and direct losses that are typical both for the contract and the nature of the goods. This limited liability also applies to negligent breaches of obligations caused by our legal representatives or auxiliary staff.  
For the rest, we are liable according to legal regulations if the contractual partner asserts compensation claims for damages or losses which are the result of intent or gross negligence, including the result of intent or gross negligence caused by our legal representatives or auxiliary staff. If we are not charged with grossly negligent or intentional breaches of duty, our liability is limited to average foreseeable damages which might be typical for these circumstances.  
The above limitations of liability do not apply when damages or losses are caused by injury to life, body or health.

#### 11\. Warranty

You can contact us by e-mail at [service.en@skatedeluxe.com](mailto:service.en@skatedeluxe.com). We endeavour to settle possible differences of opinion regarding our contract by means of mutual agreement.
