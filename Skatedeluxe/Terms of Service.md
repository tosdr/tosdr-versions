After our receival of the offer to purchase, you will receive an automatically generated e-mail with which we confirm that we have received your order. This receipt does not constitute the acceptance of your offer to purchase.

A purchase agreement is only concluded if we explicitly declare acceptance of the offer to purchase or if we ship the goods without prior express declaration of acceptance. The acceptance period within which we can accept your offer to purchase is a maximum of 3 weekdays.

The conclusion of the contract can be effected in English.

Our offer is directed solely to direct end consumers. Purchasing products for resale is strictly prohibited. If we suspect you intend to purchase products in order to resell them, we reserve the right to refuse orders, cancel orders and/or block and delete your customer account.

#### 4\. Delivery and Shipping Costs

You will receive your order in one package if possible. We reserve the right to deliver your order in multiple packages if it contains bulky products. This is no disadvantage for you since we pay for the additional shipping costs. Find all information about shipping costs for your delivery here: [Shipping Costs](https://www.skatedeluxe.com/en/shipping)

We consider obvious errors, translation errors, mistakes in writing, misprints or calculation errors occurring while offering products or processing orders to be non-binding.

#### 7\. Instructions on cancellations

**Right of Cancellation**  
  
Customers from within the EU have the right to cancel this contract within 30 days without providing a reason. For customers from outside the EU we grant a voluntary right to return any merchandise within 30 days.  
  
The cancellation period will expire after 30 days, starting from the day you, or the recipient, received the order in its entirety.  
  
To exercise the right of cancellation, you must inform us (skatedeluxe GmbH, Am Heuberg 25, 37308 Schimberg, Germany, phone number: +49 3641 79 97 250, e-mail address: [service.en@skatedeluxe.com](mailto:service.en@skatedeluxe.com)) of your decision to withdraw from this contract by means of an unequivocal statement (e.g. a letter sent by post, fax or e-mail). You may use the attached [withdrawal form template](https://www.skatedeluxe.com/images/content/widerruf/com/withdrawal-form-com-en.pdf), but it is not obligatory.  
  
To meet the cancellation deadline, it is sufficient if you communicate your intentions to exercise your right of revocation before the cancellation period has expired.  
  
**Effects of Cancellation**  
  
EU-countries: If you withdraw from this contract, we shall reimburse all payments received from you, including the costs of delivery (with the exception of the supplementary costs resulting from your choice of a type of delivery other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by us), without undue delay and in any event, no later than 14 days from the date on which we are informed of your decision to withdraw from this contract.

NON-EU-countries: In case of a correct exercise of the right of cancellation we refund payments already made  (except shipping costs) within 10 days after receipt of the merchandise.

The reimbursement will be carried out using the same means of payment used for the initial transaction unless expressly agreed otherwise; in any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement. We may withhold reimbursement until we have received the goods back or you have supplied evidence of having sent back the goods, whichever happens first.

You shall send back the goods or hand them over to us, without undue delay and no later than 14 days after you communicate to us your withdrawal from this contract. The deadline is met if you send back the goods before the period of 30 days has expired.  
  
We cover the costs of returning the goods for delivery to the following areas: all EU-countries, Switzerland, Liechtenstein and the United Kingdom. The return of the goods is free of charge if you use the return shipping label provided by us. For deliveries to all other countries, you must cover the costs of the return shipment and any taxes and customs duties incurred. [More info on returns.](https://www.skatedeluxe.com/en/return)  
  
You are only liable for any diminished value of the goods resulting from handling of the goods other than what is necessary to establish their nature, characteristics and function.  
  
  
**Exclusions of the Right of Cancellation**  
The right of cancellation does not apply to contracts:

* if the delivered goods are newspapers, periodicals or magazines with the exception of subscription contracts,
* if the goods are not prefabricated and whose production is based on individual selection or provision by the consumer, or if the goods are clearly tailored to the personal needs of the consumer,
* if the products delivered are sealed goods that are not suitable for return for reasons of health or hygiene, if their seal has been removed after delivery,
* if after their delivery, the goods were inseparably mixed with other goods due to the nature of the products.

#### 8\. Reservation of title

* You are a reseller;
* The displayed price in our online shop was incorrect;
* We are unable to deliver to the address provided;
* We are unable to provide service due to events that are out of our control.

#### 10\. Liability

For negligent breaches of the contract's main obligations, our liability is limited to average foreseeable and direct losses that are typical both for the contract and the nature of the goods. This limited liability also applies to negligent breaches of obligations caused by our legal representatives or auxiliary staff.  
For the rest, we are liable according to legal regulations if the contractual partner asserts compensation claims for damages or losses which are the result of intent or gross negligence, including the result of intent or gross negligence caused by our legal representatives or auxiliary staff. If we are not charged with grossly negligent or intentional breaches of duty, our liability is limited to average foreseeable damages which might be typical for these circumstances.  
The above limitations of liability do not apply when damages or losses are caused by injury to life, body or health.

#### 11\. Warranty

In the case of defects in delivered goods, statutory rights apply.

#### 12\. Complaints
