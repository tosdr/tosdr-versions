SlickVPN’s Terms and Conditions
-------------------------------

We work hard to bring you the very best VPN service available, and we hope you enjoy it. Take a few minutes to read through our terms and conditions page. We take your trust seriously, and we encourage our customers to make sure they read through this page and refer to it as necessary.

This agreement, which will be known as ‘Agreement’, outlines the terms and conditions that apply to users of our VPN and other related services. ‘SlickVPN’ will refer to SlickVPN, while ‘Customer’ will refer to you, the user of our services. By signing up for SlickVPN services, you acknowledge that you have read this Agreement and that you agree to the terms and conditions that it contains.

Here are our terms:

**Lawful Use of Services**

For starters, SlickVPN service may not be used to access, transmit, display, or distribute illegal content. Such content includes that which:

* violates local, state, or federal laws;
* violates copyright, trademark, patent, and other intellectual property rights of any third party including SlickVPN;
* contains child pornography or other material in violation of child abuse or exploitation laws;
* contains viruses that cause damage to third parties including SlickVPN;
* contains harassing, threatening, defamatory, slanderous, or libelous  content; and is otherwise in violation of any laws or is intended to harm or defraud third parties including SlickVPN.

SlickVPN service may not be used to perform any illegal or harassing actions such as spamming, hacking, and any other behavior that is in violation of local, state, or federal laws. Software used when using SlickVPN services must be legally and appropriately licensed.

SlickVPN reserves the right to terminate service at its discretion without prior notice or warning in the event Customer commits any of the above mentioned violations.

**Customer Obligation to Pay Fees for Services**

SlickVPN may, by the 10th day of each payment period (month, quarter, or year) as agreed to by Customer, take action to receive or request payment from Customer. Such actions may include charging Customer’s credit card if such information is given and provided permission to do so, or sending an email to Customer with an invoice outlining the service fees for the month, quarter, or year.

In the case that an invoice is sent to Customer via email, Customer must make payment in no later than 10 days after the due date that is indicated on the invoice. In the event Customer fails to make payment within specified time period, SlickVPN may terminate Customer’s account. Customer is also responsible for providing payment of additional fees not included in monthly, quarterly, or yearly service fees.

If Customer chooses to terminate account in accordance with Section 3 of this Agreement, Customer is responsible for and agrees to pay any fees that have not been paid.

SlickVPN services may be provided monthly, quarterly, or yearly, and Customer is responsible for any fees incurred each month, quarter, or year. Providing termination notice within the month, quarter, or year does not entitle Customer to refund or proration of fees. A refund may only be granted, upon Customer request, within 30 days of payment.

**Account Term, Termination, and Restoration**

The Agreement becomes effective on the day that Customer signs up for SlickVPN’s services. The term of Customer’s account will continue on a monthly, quarterly, or yearly basis unless terminated in accordance with the terms and conditions outlined in this section. Either party, SlickVPN or Customer, may terminate the Agreement upon notifying the other party.

Customer agrees to request termination of his/her account via the cancellation page found on the SlickVPN website. Requests to cancel must be submitted and received by the end of the month, quarter, or year of intended cancellation. Attempts to cancel the account via email or written notice or in any other manner other than that which is outlined in this  
section will be considered void. Sections 3 – 8 of the Agreement will not be terminated and will continue even following the termination of Customer’s account.

Upon account termination, Customer may restore account within 7 business days of cancellation. Upon receiving the payment from Customer, SlickVPN will restore and reactivate Customer’s account within two business days.

**Customer Liability and Indemnification**

SlickVPN shall not be held responsible or liable to a third party for the violation of this Agreement by Customer. Customer will hold harmless and indemnify SlickVPN from any liability, damages, claims from third parties, expenses, and losses that result from Customer’s violation of the Agreement.

**Limitation of Liability**

SlickVPN shall under no circumstances be held liable for damages that are the result of loss of data, use of services, or any incidental, punitive, or other damages that are in connection with the Agreement or SlickVPN services. Cumulative liability of SlickVPN shall not exceed five-hundred U.S. dollars ($500).

**Warranty Disclaimer**

Services that are displayed and available on the SlickVPN.com website are provided ‘as is’ and do not have a warranty. Any warranties, whether express or implied, are disclaimed by SlickVPN.

**Taxes**

Customer agrees that SlickVPN will be held harmless and indemnified from taxes that are the result of the Customer’s use of SlickVPN services. Customer agrees to pay such taxes. These include penalties and interest associated with Customer’s use of services, or other costs associated with Customer’s use of services.

Any provision or portions of provisions in the Agreement found to be invalid under any relevant statute or law will be omitted from the Agreement. The remainder of the Agreement will remain in effect. The Agreement supersedes all previous agreements between the parties whether written or verbal related to the material contained in this Agreement.

The rights and obligations outlined in this Agreement, and the Agreement itself, may not be transferred or otherwise assigned by Customer, but may be transferred or otherwise assigned by SlickVPN. Waivers or provisions of the Agreement, or a delay by either party in enforcing any of the rights outlined below are not to be interpreted as a continuing waiver and will not create any expectation of non-enforcement of the provision or other provisions.

In the event of a legal proceeding between the parties, the prevailing parties may recover any costs, expenses and attorney’s fees. It is recognized that the Agreement is created under and governed by the laws of the United States of America, except when in conflict with law.

The Agreement is subject to changes by SlickVPN at any time and without notice. If the Customer continues to use SlickVPN services after changes have been made is interpreted as Customer’s acknowledgement and acceptance of any changes. For this reason, we recommend Customer checks the SlickVPN website regularly for any changes to the Agreement or SlickVPN policies.
