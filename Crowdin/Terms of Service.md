### 4\. OUR RESPONSIBILITIES

#### 4.1. Provision of Crowdin Services.

Supplier will (a) make the Crowdin Services, Content and Client Data available to a Client pursuant to these Terms, (b) provide applicable standard support for the Crowdin Services to Client at no additional charge, and/or upgraded support (for an additional charge, if applicable), (c) use commercially reasonable efforts to make the Crowdin Services available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, except for: (i) planned downtime (of which Supplier shall give advance electronic notice as provided in the Guidelines), and (ii) any unavailability caused by circumstances beyond Supplier’s reasonable control, including, for example, an act of God, act of government, flood, fire, earthquake, civil unrest, act of terror, strike or other labor problem, Internet service provider failure or delay, or denial of service attack.

#### 4.2. Protection of Client Data.

Supplier will maintain administrative, physical, and technical safeguards for protection of the security, confidentiality, and integrity of Client Data, as described in the Guidelines. Those safeguards will include, but will not be limited to, measures for preventing access, use, modification or disclosure of Client Data by Supplier personnel except (a) to provide the Crowdin Services and prevent or address service or technical problems, (b) as compelled by law in accordance with Section 7.4 (Compelled Disclosure) below, or (c) as a Client or User expressly permit in writing.

The Services may be performed using equipment or facilities located in the European Union, the United States, and Ukraine. The Supplier’s service providers located outside the EU are either Privacy Shield compliant or have executed Standard Contractual Clauses (as approved by the European Commission) that provide legal grounds for assuring that, when processed outside the European Union, the personal data of EU citizens when using the Crowdin Service will receive from the Supplier and its service providers located outside the EU an adequate level of protection within the meaning of Article 46 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation).

By agreeing to these Terms, the Client grants the Supplier a general authorization in the meaning of Article 28 (2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 to engage processors for the purposes of providing the Crowdin Services. For more information about processors or if you want to subscribe to an email list and receive updates on the changes to the list of sub-processors, please see our [List of Sub-processors](https://support.crowdin.com/sub-processors/)

### 5\. USING THE CROWDIN SERVICES

#### 5.1 Establishing an Account.

Certain features, functions, parts or elements of the Crowdin Services can be used or accessed only by holders of an Account. The person who wishes to create an Account must:

1. complete the sign-up form on the Web Site or alternative process provided by a Reseller if access to the Crowdin Services is purchased from a Reseller;
2. and accept these Terms by clicking “Sign up” or other similar button.

Each Client may have only one Account. If several persons need to use an Account on behalf of Client, Client must designate such persons as Users.

Each such User shall be subject to the restrictions set forth in these Terms. If Client has designated Users and granted them Authorization, such Users will be deemed to be authorized to act on behalf of Client when using the Account.

Supplier is not responsible for and shall have no liability for verifying the validity of Authorization of any User. However, Supplier may, in its discretion, request additional information or proof of the person’s credentials. If Supplier is not certain if a User has been granted Authorization, Supplier may, in its sole discretion, prevent such User from accessing the Crowdin Services and/or suspend or terminate the Account.

A User may be associated with multiple Clients and Accounts. Blocking a User from one Account or Project will not remove the User from the Platform if he/she is connected to multiple Accounts. The Client and any User associated with an Account must provide Supplier with true, accurate, current, and complete information about the Client, Users and Account and keep it up to date.

#### 5.2 Logging Into an Account.

Client creates a username and password (“Login Credentials”) to be used to log in to its Account unless the Client uses the single sign-on feature or another service to log in. These Login Credentials must not be used by multiple persons. If Client has designated several Users, each User should create separate Login Credentials. Client and each User are responsible for keeping confidential all login credentials associated with an Account. Client must promptly notify Supplier of any disclosure, loss or unauthorized use of any Login Credentials.

#### 5.3 Termination of Account.

Client may terminate these Terms by terminating the Account at any time as provided in Section 17. Supplier shall permanently delete the Account within six months of the effective date of the termination.

#### 5.4 Fees.

The use of an Account is subject to a Fee. Different rates apply to different Plans. The applicable Fee is charged in advance on monthly or annual payment intervals, unless agreed otherwise between parties. In case of cancellation by Supplier, Supplier shall refund due amount of money paid by the Client for the unused Software Services except the amounts of the discount provided to the Client for the Annual Subscription. If, after signing up, Client elects to upgrade to a more expensive Plan, the unused portion of any prepaid Fees shall be applied to the Fee of the more expensive Plan.

All Fees are stated net and are exclusive of all taxes, VAT, levies, fees, withholdings, or duties applicable under any applicable law, unless stated otherwise stated herein. Client is solely responsible for the payment of such taxes, VAT, levies, fees, withholdings, or duties. The Client shall not make any deductions, withholdings or reduction of the Fees without first obtaining Supplier’s written consent. In the event the net amount received by Supplier is less than the Fee, Supplier shall have the right to stop providing the Services.

#### 5.5 Changing Plans.

Any Client has the right to upgrade or downgrade a current Plan at any time by selecting a new Plan among the collection of Plans determined by the Supplier. In such an event, the Client’s credit card on file with the Supplier will automatically be charged with a Fee for the next payment interval with the rate stipulated in the new Plan. Downgrading of the current Plan may cause the loss of features or capacity of the Account.

#### 5.6 Free Trial.

A new Client may be entitled to a Free Trial, unless the Client has applied for the Account as a result of an ongoing marketing campaign organized by the Supplier in cooperation with its partners. The Client is not required to provide any credit card information during the period of Free Trial. If the period of Free Trial has expired, the Account will be automatically deactivated. In order to prevent deactivation or to reactivate the Account, the Client is required to select a suitable Plan and pay the first Fee. If the Client does not pay the first Fee within 2 weeks as of the expiry of the Free Trial, Supplier has the right to permanently delete the Account, including all Client Data therein.

### 6\. PAYMENT

The following provisions are applicable only if you purchase access to the Crowdin Services directly from Supplier. If you purchase access to the Crowdin Services through a Reseller, the payment terms are set forth in the agreement with your Reseller.

#### 6.1 Credit Card Authorization.

Supplier’s payment processing partner listed in the list of processors may seek pre-authorization of Client’s credit card account prior to your purchase of Crowdin Services in order to verify that the credit card is valid and has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your purchase. You authorize such credit card account to pay any amounts described herein, and authorize Supplier to charge all sums described in these Terms to such credit card account. You agree to provide Supplier updated information regarding your credit card account upon Supplier’s request and any time the information earlier provided is no longer valid.

#### 6.2 Electronic Invoice.

In case the Client is willing to pay via Purchase Order or Wire Transfer, the invoice for payment will be issued on request, all requests should be sent to sales@crowdin.com. The electronic invoices are available only for annual and semi-annual payment intervals. Client must pay the invoice by the due date indicated on the invoice.

### 7\. CLIENT DATA

#### 7.1 Uploading Client Data to Platform.

If the Client uploads Client Data to the Platform, such Client Data and any processing of such Client Data must be in compliance with these Terms and applicable law. By uploading Client Data to the Platform and/or using Crowdin Services, the Client represents that the Client has all necessary legal rights, title and interest in and to the Client Data whether posted and/or uploaded by the Client or with Client’s authorization or made available on or through the Crowdin Services by Supplier. By uploading Client Data to the Platform, Client authorizes Supplier to process the Client Data.

The Client is responsible for ensuring that:

* the Client and any of the Users associated with the Account do not create, transmit, display or make otherwise available any Client Data that violates the terms of these Terms, the rights of Supplier or is harmful (for example viruses, worms, malware and other destructive codes), offensive, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortuous, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, invasive of another’s privacy, hateful or otherwise unlawful;
* and the Client and all of the Users associated with the Account have the necessary rights to use the Client Data, including to insert it into the Platform and process it by means of the Account.
* the Account or Client Data is not used for any illegal or unlawful activities.

#### 7.2 No Guarantee of Accuracy.

Supplier does not guarantee any accuracy with respect to any information contained in any Client Data, and strongly recommends that you think carefully about what you transmit, submit or post to or through the Crowdin Services. You understand that all information contained in Client Data is the sole responsibility of the person from whom such Client Data originated.

This means that Client, and not Supplier, is entirely responsible for all Client Data that is uploaded, posted, transmitted, or otherwise made available through the Crowdin Services, as well as for any actions taken by the Suppliers or other Clients or Users or third parties as a result of such Client Data.

Supplier has no obligations to monitor the use of or ensure that the Client Data does not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of other Clients, Users or third parties. Client or User (as the case may be) is solely responsible for securing all necessary rights to the Client Data.

#### 7.3 Unlawful Client Data.

Supplier is not obliged to pre-screen, monitor or filter any Client Data or acts of its processing by the Client in order to discover any unlawful nature therein. However, if such unlawful Client Data or the action of its unlawful processing is discovered or brought to the attention of Supplier or if there is reason to believe that certain Client Data is unlawful, Supplier has the right to:

* notify the Client of such unlawful Client Data;
* demand that the Client bring the unlawful Client Data into compliance with these Terms and applicable law;
* temporarily or permanently remove the unlawful Client Data from the Web Site or Account, restrict access to it, suspend it or delete it.

If Supplier is presented convincing evidence that the Client Data is not unlawful, Supplier may, at its sole discretion, restore such Client Data, which was removed from the Account or access to which was restricted. In addition, in the event Supplier believes in its sole discretion Client Data violates applicable laws, rules or regulations or these Terms, Supplier may (but has no obligation), to remove such Client Data at any time with or without notice.

Crowdin OÜ as the data processor will assist the Client as the data controller in meeting the Client’s obligations under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, providing subject access, and allowing data subjects to exercise their rights under Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

#### 7.4 Compelled Disclosure.

Supplier may disclose a Client’s confidential information to the extent compelled by law to do so. In such instance, Supplier will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Client with prior notice of the compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and Client shall provide reasonable assistance, at its cost, if Client wishes to contest the disclosure. If Supplier is compelled by law to disclose Client’s confidential information as part of a civil proceeding to which Supplier is a party, and Client is not contesting the disclosure, Client will reimburse Supplier for its reasonable cost of compiling and providing secure access to that confidential information.

### 8\. SERVICES

Subject to these Terms, and the payment of the applicable service Fee, Supplier grants Client and its authorized users a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sub-licensable license to use the Crowdin Services to:

The contacts for all enquiries of support are: chat application on the Web Page, or e-mail: [support@crowdin.com](mailto:support@crowdin.com) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you purchased access to the Crowdin Services from a Reseller, then first-line technical support will be provided by the Reseller and not by the Supplier.

#### 8.3 Modifications to Service.

Supplier reserves the right to modify the Crowdin Services or any part or element thereof from time to time without prior notice, including, without limitation:

* rebranding the Crowdin Services at its sole discretion;
* ceasing providing or discontinuing the development any particular Crowdin Service or part or element of the Platform temporarily or permanently;
* taking such action as is necessary to preserve Supplier’s rights upon any use of the Crowdin Services that may be reasonably interpreted as violation of Supplier’s intellectual property rights, distribution of Internet viruses, worms, Trojan horses, malware, and other destructive activities or illegal activity.

As applicable, Client may be notified of such modifications when logging in to the Account. Modifications, including change in applicable rates for the Crowdin Services, will become effective thirty (30) days before the effective date of such modification.

If the Client does not accept the modification, the Client shall notify Supplier or Reseller (if Client purchased access to the Crowdin Services from a Reseller) before the effective date of the modification, and these Terms will terminate on the effective date of the modification.
