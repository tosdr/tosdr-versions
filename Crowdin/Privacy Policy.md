* Continuously reduce risks within the organization’s ISMS.

This strategic objectives are supported by annual KPIs, described in more detail in the _ISMS-PL-Monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of ISMS Policy_ policy:

* Availability time of the service (>99,95% yearly)
* Data confidentiality incidents count (goal: 0)
* Data integrity incidents count (goal: 0)
* Physical security incidents count (goal: 0)
* Prioritized issues to be fixed immediately (goal: <100)
* Vulnerabilities count found during pentest (security level: strong or very strong)
* Vulnerabilities count found via reporting program (goal: no critical reports)
* Planned ISMS tasks done in previous period (goal: 100%)
* Quantity of unsuccessful or defective system updates (goal <25)
* Active risks distribution (decrease or increase of identified risks number) (goal <10 risks classified as very high)
* Phishing testing: percentage of compromised users (goal: 0%)

### What will be done

Current policies, processes, and security measures will be continuously reviewed. Any gaps in alignment with ISO/IEC 27001:2022 standards will be identified and addressed.

A proactive risk management strategy will be maintained. This strategy includes conducting regular risk assessments, vulnerability scans, and security audits. Identified risks will be analyzed, and continuous mitigation measures will be implemented.

### What resources will be required

* Professionals with expertise in information security, data protection, and risk management.
* Security technologies, including secure data storage solutions, device management solutions, encryption technologies, vulnerability assessment tools.
* Skilled auditors and analysts to assess the effectiveness of implemented security measures and identify areas for improvement.
* Access to up-to-date threat intelligence sources
* Adequate budget allocation to support investments in security technologies, personnel, training programs, and processes improvements.

### Who will be responsible

The ISMS Committee has the final responsibility for Information Security Risks across Crowdin.

Detailed information about the functions, regulation, duties and responsibilities of the ISMS Committee is in the Regulation on ISMS Committee.

Managers/Head of Departments are responsible for information security within their departments/teams. They must ensure that the department/team has communicated their own informational security needs to the CISO.

CISO is clearly accountable for the provision of appropriate, timely advice to the management to ensure that an effective information risk management framework is implemented, operated and maintained in alignment with the business strategy, the business and the legal requirements.

All personnel, regardless of function, level and role, shall have explicit personal responsibilities for Information Security Management.

Responsibilities are described in detail in the _ISMS-FR-Information Security Management Framework_, and in other corresponding policies.

### When it will be completed

Continuous monitoring and improvement of ISMS will be an ongoing task to maintain compliance.

Regular risk assessments and mitigation activities will be scheduled periodically. Vulnerability assessments will be conducted regularly as part of the organization’s ongoing security practices. Proactive measures will be implemented immediately upon identification of vulnerabilities to ensure continuous protection.

The Incident Response Plan is annually reviewed, updated and tested to ensure its effectiveness in minimizing potential damage in the event of a security incident.

### How the results will be evaluated

Systems, processes and activities that can be monitored in the ISMS include, but are not limited to:

* Audit;
* Risk assessment process;
* Risk management of third parties;
* Business continuity management;
* The maturity of implementation of ISMS processes;
* Incident management;
* Vulnerability management;
* Configuration management;
* Training and level of awareness raising activities;
* Access control, firewall and other event logs;
* Management of physical and environmental safety; and
* System monitoring.

The organization’s compliance with ISO/IEC 27001:2022 is evaluated through internal audit, management review, ISMS committee meetings. Annual external audits conducted by certification bodies will further validate our compliance status.

Key performance indicators defined will be closely monitored. Any security breaches or incidents will trigger immediate investigation and corrective action to ensure the security of customer and employee data, as well as our internal business processes.

Monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of ISMS processes is described in the _ISMS-PL-Monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of ISMS Policy_
