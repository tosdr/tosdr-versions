Community Guidelines
====================

At ASKfm we believe that questions and answers are the key to staying close to friends, exploring the world around us and learning something new about ourselves. Using anonymity makes it easier to ask questions and get to know others.

With millions of users globally, our goal is to support and empower our users to create an environment on ASKfm that feels safe and inclusive. That is why we have put together the following general guidelines to help you better understand what we expect from our users on ASKfm.

**Respect**  
Respect is the foundation of our community. We want to make sure that everyone can have a great experience on ASKfm. It’s not OK to make a poll with photos of other users without their consent. We will remove such poll, if it’s reported.

Remember: posting threatening, bullying or harassing questions and answers is ALWAYS unacceptable on ASKfm.

It can be really easy to miscommunicate online and accidentally offend people — watch out for sarcasm with people you do not know because it can sometime cause conflict.

**Real YOU**  
There is no need to pretend to be someone else on ASKfm. In fact, it’s NEVER allowed. You can ask anonymous questions if you want, but creating a fake profile is not OK.

Remember:

* Using ASKfm if you’re under 13 is a no-go. The age requirement is there for your own protection.
* Posting spam or ‘collecting likes’ is considered rude.

**YOUR well-being**  
While we have put various [safety tools](http://safety.ask.fm/safety-tools/) in place, you too can do a lot to be in charge of your ASKfm experience: use settings, report or block anyone that bothers you.

Remember:

* Promoting and encouraging suicide, self injury and eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia is unacceptable. There is more info available if you need [help](http://safety.ask.fm/).
* Asking yourself questions is OK, but sending yourself cruel messages is not.

**Respecting others**  
ASKfm is proud to have people of different cultures, races, religions, and sexual orientation on the platform. We are all equal and have equal rights. It is unacceptable to post content which is racist, sexist, ageist or discriminatory in any other way.

Terrorist organisations and violent extremist groups that intend to encourage or commit terrorist or violent criminal activity are prohibited from maintaining a presence on ASKfm to promote any of their campaigns or plans, celebrate their violent acts, fundraise, or recruit young people.

**What’s not OK to share?  
**Sometimes it can be really tricky to figure out what is and is not appropriate to post. For example, remember that the following content is NEVER allowed on ASKfm:

* Bullying, doxxing, hating, insults, intimidation;
* Encouraging people to commit suicide, examples of unsafe behavior, life-threatening challenges, threats to the life of any person or animal or wish for death or any form of self-harm (or glamourising such things);
