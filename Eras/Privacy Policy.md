1\. Introduction [↑](#top)
--------------------------

We, eras, take the protection of your personal data very seriously and strictly adhere to the rules laid out by data protection laws and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR-EU and GDPR-UK).

This privacy notice gives you information on how we collect and process your personal data through your use of this site and any data you may provide if you contact us regarding our products and services.

We have appointed a data protection officer (DPO) who is responsible for monitoring and providing guidance with our GDPR status. If you have any questions about this privacy notice, including any requests to exercise your legal rights, please contact the DPO using the contact information in [section 16](#16) of this privacy notice.

2\. Why We Collect Your Personal Information [↑](#top)
------------------------------------------------------

We collect your personal data for one of the following purposes:

### 2.1 All Users

* • To manage communications between you and us
* • To provide you with information you have requested or which we feel may be of interest to you
* • To ensure the safe operation of our website and to monitor the performance of our website

### 2.2 Clients

* • Where we need to perform the contract we have entered into with you
* • For marketing and advertising purposes

### 2.3 Assessment Participants

* • To personalise reports on the results of your assessments
* • To provide assistance and support

3\. Lawful Basis of Processing Information
------------------------------------------

We only collect and use personal information about you when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we use it where:

* • The data subject (you) has given consent to the processing activity taking place
* • If the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract
* • If the processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject
* • If the processing is necessary for the purpose of the legitimate interest pursued by us or our partners

Where legitimate interest is identified as a lawful basis, we will undertake a legitimate interest assessment which is a three-part test covering:

* **The purpose test** - to identify the legitimate interest
* **Necessity test** - to consider if the processing is necessary for the purpose identified
* **Balancing test** - considering the individual's interests, rights or freedoms and whether these override the legitimate interests identified.

4\. What Information We Collect and Where From [↑](#top)
--------------------------------------------------------

We collect personal information from you, for example, if you register to our website, request product information, call us or use any of our services. The categories of personal information that we may collect, store and use about you include:

### 4.1 Special Category Data

* • Name, address, telephone number, email.
* • IP address
* • Date of birth

### 4.2 Third Party Collection of Personal Data

We may also collect your data through Third Parties such as professional conference attendee lists.

5\. How Long We Keep Information for? [↑](#top)
-----------------------------------------------

### 5.1 Assessment Participants

If you have been asked to complete an assessment via The Psychometric Portal we (eras ltd) act only as the **data processor**, it is our client that has asked you to complete the assessment that is the **data controller** and is responsible for defining the retention period for your data.

### 5.2 Others

We pride ourselves on ensuring that your personal data is only retained for the period that we need it for, or in accordance with laws, regulations and professional obligations that we are subject to. All personal information collected has a defined retention period, which is in-line with our retention policy. If you would like to find out how long your information is being retained, please see "additional information", [section 16](#16) of this policy.

6\. Security of Personal Information [↑](#top)
----------------------------------------------

We take the responsibility for protecting your privacy very seriously and we will ensure your data is secured in accordance with our obligations under the Data Protection laws. We have in place technical and organisational measures to ensure personal information is secured and to prevent your personal data from being accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. We have in place a robust access control policy which limits access to your personal data to those employees, contractors and other third parties who only have a business need to know. The processing of your personal data will only take place subject to our instruction.

We have policies and procedures to handle any potential data security breaches and data subjects, third parties and any applicable regulators will be notified where we are legally required to do so.

We have ensured that all employees have had information security and data protection training. If you would like more details of the security we have in place, please see "additional information", [section 16](#16) of this policy.

7\. Children's Information [↑](#top)
------------------------------------

We do not knowingly collect information on children. If we have collected personal information on a child, please contact us immediately using the details in [section 16](#16) , so we can remove this information without any undue delay.

8\. Your Individual Rights [↑](#top)
------------------------------------

In this section, we have summarised the rights that you have under General Data Protection Regulation. Some of the rights are complex, and not all the details have been included in our summaries. Accordingly, you should read the relevant laws and guidance from the regulatory authorities for a full explanation of these rights.

Your principal rights under General Data Protection Regulation and when you can exercise them are as follows:

| Your right | When you can exercise it |
| --- | --- |
| Right to object | * Processing relies on legitimate interest<br>* Processing is for scientific or historical research<br>* Processing includes automated decision making and profiling<br>* Processing is for direct marketing purposes |
| Right of access | * You or any third party acting on your behalf with your authority may request a copy of the personal data we hold about you without charge.<br>* We will ask to verify your identity or request evidence from the third party that they are acting on your behalf before releasing any personal data we hold about you. |
| Right to be informed | We are required, to provide clear and transparent information to you about how we process your personal data. This privacy notice addresses this right. |

| Right to erasure | If there is no legal basis or legitimate reason for processing your personal data, you may request that we erase it. |

------------------------------------------------------
