We may also share your information with vendors who help us verify your identity by performing biometric or other analyses to help us detect and prevent fraud.

**Clear GIFs (Web Beacons)**

We may employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons) that help us better manage content on our Website by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements and actions of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We may tie the information gathered by clear gifs to other Personal Information. We may use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.

**"Do Not Track" Signals**

Our Website currently currently responds to the Global Privacy Control signal. It does not respond to other  “Do Not Track” (DNT) signals at this time.

VI. How long we keep your information

We will retain your information for as long as you use our Services or as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected, provide our products and Services, resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, enforce our agreements, and comply with applicable laws or regulations.

**External Websites**

Our Services may contain links to other websites and other websites may reference or link to our Services. These websites are operated by third parties not controlled by us, and by linking to them or being linked from them Step does not endorse, approve or make any representations about third party websites or domains. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of each and every website and domain that you interact with. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such other websites or domains and you visit them at your own risk.

**Social Media**

Our Services may contain links and interactive features with various social media platforms. If you already use these platforms, their cookies may be set on your device when using our Services. You should be aware that Personal Information which you voluntarily include and transmit online in a publicly accessible social media platform, blog, or chat room, or otherwise online, or that you share in an open forum, may be viewed and used by others without any restrictions. We have no control over such uses of your information when interacting with a social media platform, forums or otherwise online and by using such services you assume the risk that the Personal Information provided by you may be viewed and used by third parties.

**Security**

Step takes commercially reasonable steps to protect the data you have given us from accidental or intentional manipulation, loss, destruction or access by unauthorized persons. However, please be aware that no transmission of Personal Information over the Internet or the electronic storage of this information can be absolutely guaranteed to be free from unauthorized use or access. Before submitting any Personal Information via the Services, please keep in mind these risks and know that you do so at your own risk.

All changes will become effective when posted unless indicated otherwise. If we make any material changes we will notify you in accordance with applicable law. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.

IX. Use of the services by children

Our Website is not intended for children under the age of thirteen.  Children under the age of thirteen are permitted to use our App with their parent or guardian’s consent. Where we determine that an individual attempting to set up a Step account is a U13 User, we will ask for that U13 User’s parent or guardian’s contact information in order to obtain verifiable consent before allowing that U13 User to use our Services.

**What Information Does Step Collect from Children and How Is It Used?**

To participate in our Services, U18 Users and their Sponsors must create an account using the App. We ask all U18 Users to provide us with the phone number of their Sponsor, so we can notify the Sponsor of the U18 User’s interest in Step, request consent for the U18 User to use our Services and provide us with their personal information, and authorize the Sponsor to oversee the U18 User’s account. 

We request personal information from U18 Users that is reasonably necessary for their use of the Services, including their name, date of birth, phone number, email address, and mailing address. We also collect technical information and utilize cookies and analytics technologies when U18 Users engage with our Website. When we collect Personal Information from U18 Users, we will retain that information only as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was provided, ensure the security of our users and our Services, or as required by law. 

Parents or legal guardians of U18 Users older than thirteen who are not their child’s Sponsor can contact us at [privacy@step.com](mailto:privacy@step.com) to request the identity of their child’s Sponsor. Parents or legal guardians of U13 Users can contact us at [privacy@step.com](mailto:privacy@step.com) to access and review the Personal Information we have collected about their child, update their child’s information, request deletion of their child’s information, or restrict further collection or use of their child’s information. In the event we discover we have collected information from a U13 User in a manner inconsistent with applicable law, we will either delete the information or promptly seek consent from a parent or legal guardian. Please note that our deletion of your child’s information means that they will no longer be able to have a Step account or otherwise use our Services.

For more information, see our [Children’s Privacy Statement](https://step.com/policies/coppa).
