The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Company.

#### 13.4 Waiver of Jury Trial.

YOU AND COMPANY HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.

All other claims shall be arbitrated.

#### 13.6 30-Day Right to Opt Out.

You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: [\[email protected\]](https://scribehow.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection), within 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement.

#### 13.7 Severability.

Except as provided in subsection 13.5, if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.

This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company.
