==============

Virgin Australia is committed to being transparent in relation to how we collect and otherwise handle your personal information. This Cookie Policy explains how Virgin Australia Airlines Pty Ltd and its group companies listed in section 1 of the [Privacy Policy](https://www.virginaustralia.com/au/en/about-us/policies/privacy/privacy-policy/ "Read Virgin Australia's Privacy Policy") (“we”/”our”/“us”) use cookies and similar technologies on the websites we own and operate.

We want our websites to be as user friendly, informative and personal as possible and our use of cookies and similar technologies as described in this Cookie Policy helps us achieve this goal.

To the extent that information collected through our use of cookies and similar technologies constitutes personal information, the provisions of our [Privacy Policy](https://www.virginaustralia.com/au/en/about-us/policies/privacy/privacy-policy/ "Read Virgin Australia's Privacy Policy") apply to that information.

### What are cookies?
