Forward-Looking Statements
==========================

Certain statements may be forward looking in nature or “forward-looking statements” as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, trends and uncertainties that could cause actual performance to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. A number of those risks, trends and uncertainties are discussed in the company’s SEC reports, including the company’s annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Any forward-looking statements should be evaluated in light of these important risk factors. TEGNA is not responsible for updating or revising any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.
