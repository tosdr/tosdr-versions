Privacy and Security
====================

* * *

ETS recognizes the importance of protecting your privacy. This Privacy Notice describes our practices related to personal information privacy and security.

ETS has a global privacy program to protect all "Personal Information." Personal Information is any information that we can use to identify you (such as your name, username or identification number) or contact you (such as your email address or telephone number). Personal Information includes other types of information (such as test scores or demographic data) when that information is associated with your Personal Information.

Privacy Notice
--------------

This Privacy Notice describes our practices with respect to Personal Information we collect via ETS websites, platforms and applications that collect Personal Information from you. It also describes our practices with respect to Personal Information collected in other ways, such as when you register for and take ETS tests, or when we receive information from a school or test center administrator. If you are a test taker, additional information about privacy and security is included in many of the ETS Test Bulletins.

By using an ETS platform or otherwise providing us with Personal Information, you agree to our privacy terms. You can contact us at any time with questions or concerns about privacy by sending an email to [**etsinfo@ets.org**](mailto:etsinfo@ets.org) or by writing to us at the addresses in the Contact section below.

Please note that this Privacy Notice applies to all Personal Information collected by ETS via its online test registrations system. Our distributors and agents may provide vouchers to facilitate test registration, but test candidates must provide their data to ETS to register for and take tests. We will use and protect all test taker data in accordance with this Privacy Notice. 

Within this Privacy Notice, you will find information about:

### Children

ETS is committed to handling children’s data appropriately and in compliance with applicable laws.

* Our websites and test registration platforms are not designed for children under 16, and ETS does not knowingly collect Personal Information directly from children under the age of 16 on these sites. Parents and schools may create accounts for children, such as registering them for tests. The parent or school (acting for the parent) must consent to our processing of the child’s data as described in this Privacy Notice for ETS to administer the test.  
    We encourage parents and teachers to spend time online with children and to monitor their online activities. If you believe that a child has created an account on our website without having proper parental consent, please contact us to have the account deactivated by sending us an email at [**etsinfo@ets.org**](mailto:etsinfo@ets.org) or by calling us at **1-609-921-9000**.
* ETS provides parents and teachers with the ability to download certain apps that they and their children or students can use for educational purposes, such as to improve reading fluency. Some of these apps are intended for use by children under 13. ETS may collect the child's first name or nickname, age or grade in school, and basic demographic data from the parent or guardian when the child’s account is created. When the child uses the app, ETS collects audio recordings of the child's voice when the child reads passages (or a transcript of the recording), the child's responses to questions that test skills such as reading comprehension and other data relating to the child's use of the app, such as how long the child spends using the app. Our apps do not collect any other Personal Information from children, and they do not use cookies or other data-collection technologies.  
    ETS anonymizes the information collected by its educational apps and uses the information for research purposes. ETS does not maintain identifiable data about children, and children cannot make their own data publicly available via the apps. ETS does not (and will not permit any third party to) associate identifying information with research data.  
    Parents and teachers can review and delete the child's information at any time in the app. Parents and teachers can restrict ETS' collection of additional information at any time by deleting the app. Parents or teachers who have questions about how ETS handles children's data may contact ETS by sending us an email at [**etsinfo@ets.org**](mailto:etsinfo@ets.org) or by calling us at **1-609-921-9000**.

### Special Notice to California Residents

**The California Consumer Privacy Act (or "CCPA")** provides California residents with specific privacy rights, including the right to receive a privacy notice and to tell companies not to sell your Personal Information.

As a nonprofit, ETS is not directly subject to the CCPA. However, we are deeply committed to protecting the privacy and security of all the Personal Information that is entrusted to us. We do not sell Personal Information.

We have a global privacy program that protects your Personal Information no matter how or where it is collected, used or stored. We also comply with the privacy and security laws that are applicable to us. Our [**Privacy and Security Statement**](https://www.ets.org/content/ets-org/language-master/en/home/legal/privacy.html) describes our privacy and security practices in detail.

If you have any questions or concerns about your privacy, please email us at [**etsinfo@ets.org**](mailto:etsinfo@ets.org).

### Special Notice to Residents in the European Economic Area, Switzerland and the U.K.

ETS is providing this supplemental privacy notice to give individuals in the European Economic Area (EEA) the additional information required by the EU General Data Protection Regulation. These provisions, together with the statements in the ETS Privacy Notice, explain our practices with regard to EEA personal data. These statements also apply to personal data collected in Switzerland and the United Kingdom.

#### **_Information About ETS_**

This notice is being given by ETS in the United States, for itself, its EU Representative (ETS Global B.V.) and its other **EEA affiliates**.

**The Purposes and Legal Basis for Processing, Including Legitimate Interests**

The Privacy Notice explains the reasons why we process your Personal Information. We only process Personal Information when we have a legal basis for the processing, such as:

* To fulfill a contract with you, such as to provide you with an ETS test or a test offered by another company through ETS.
* For closely related purposes, such as payment processing and financial account management, contract management, website administration, business continuity and disaster recovery, security and fraud prevention, corporate governance, reporting and legal compliance.
* With your consent (or provided you have not objected, as may be applicable), such as to provide you with marketing communications or to send your scores to your designated recipients.

We may also process your Personal Information for the purposes of our legitimate interests, provided that such processing shall not outweigh your rights and freedoms. In particular, we may process your Personal Information as needed to:

* Protect you, us or others from threats (such as security threats or test fraud)
* Improve ETS' tests and support ETS Research initiatives
* Comply with the laws that are applicable to us around the world
* Enable or administer our business, such as for quality control, consolidated reporting and customer service
* Manage corporate transactions, such as mergers or acquisitions
* Understand and improve our business, improve test integrity and for research purposes

**Automated Decision Making and Profiling**

ETS may use automated processes in connection with scoring tests and for similar purposes as needed to provide the test services that you have requested. All such decisions are subject to human review. We will not make automated decisions about you that may significantly affect you, unless (1) the decision is necessary as part of a contract that we have with you, (2) we have your explicit consent, or (3) we are required by law to use the technology. You can learn more about test scoring by reading the information posted about each of our tests.

In some cases, we use certain elements of personal data for ETS Research. For example, we may consider how certain types of test takers (such as nonnative English speakers) respond to specific test questions. Our research initiatives reflect our commitment to fairness and equity in testing, helping to ensure that our tests are accessible and free from bias. They also seek to improve teaching, learning and assessment. Our research results do not contain any identifiable data and are not used to target or profile individuals. Learn more about [**ETS Research**](https://www.ets.org/content/ets-org/language-master/en/home/research.html).

**When You Are Required to Provide Personal Information to ETS**

In most cases, you are not required by law to provide any Personal Information to ETS. You are required to provide certain Personal Information to enable us to enter into a contract with you so that you can use our products and services. Our registration forms indicate which data elements are required for our contracts. If you do not provide these data elements, we cannot do business with you.

If you request an accommodation from ETS, such as special testing conditions needed because of a health condition or disability, you may be required to submit additional Personal Information (including special categories of data) as needed for us to evaluate and respond to your request.

**Your Rights**

As stated in the Privacy Notice, you always have the right to object to our marketing communications. To opt out of emails, simply click the link labeled "Unsubscribe" at the bottom of any email we send you. To revoke permissions that you may have given to send text messages, text STOP in response to any message.

ETS also respects the rights of EEA, Swiss and U.K. residents to access, correct and request erasure or restriction of their personal information as required by law. This means:

* You generally have a right to know whether or not ETS maintains your Personal Information. If we do have your Personal Information, we will provide you with a copy (subject to the rights of others). If your information is incorrect or incomplete, you have the right to ask us to update it.
* You have the right to object to our processing of your Personal Information.
* You may also ask us to delete or restrict your Personal Information.

To exercise these rights, please see **_Your Privacy Rights and Choices_** Please understand that we may need to verify your identify before we can process your request. Additionally, our ability to delete Personal Information will be limited in those cases where we are required to retain records, such as in connection with score reports and test security processes.

If you believe that we have processed your Personal Information in violation of applicable law, you may file a complaint with the ETS Office of the General Counsel or with a supervisory authority.

**International Transfers**

As stated in the Privacy Notice, your Personal Information may be transferred to, stored at or processed in the United States and other countries which may not have equivalent privacy or data protection laws.

We generally use approved Standard Contractual Clauses to assure that Personal Information is adequately protected when it is transferred out of the EEA, U.K. or Switzerland, but we may also make transfers to recipients in places that have been declared adequate, with approved Binding Corporate Rules or pursuant to another derogation.

Please contact us via email at [**etsinfo@ets.org**](mailto:etsinfo@ets.org) if you would like more information about cross-border transfers or to obtain a copy of the Standard Contractual Clauses.

**Data Retention**

We will retain your Personal Information for as long as the information is needed for the purposes set forth above and for any additional period that may be required or permitted by law. If you would like us to delete your personal information, please see **_Your Privacy Rights and Choices_** for information about how to submit a deletion request. Unless we are required by law or have a legitimate interest to retain your information, we will delete it within 30 days of your request.
