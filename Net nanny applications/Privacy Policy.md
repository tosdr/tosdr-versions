Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your information for the relevant purpose.

* if you want us to establish the data's accuracy;
* where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it;
* where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or

###### Right not to be subject to automated decision making:

You have the right not to be subject to automated decision-making (including profiling) which has legal or other significant effects on you.

###### Right to complain:
