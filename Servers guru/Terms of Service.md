    2. **Relationship:** Nothing in this Agreement will be construed as creating a partnership or relationship of employer and employee, principal and agent, partnership, or joint venture between Servers.guru and its customers. Each of Servers.guru and its customers will be deemed an independent contractor at all times and will have no right or authority to assume or create any obligation on behalf of the other, except as may be expressly provided herein.
        
    3. **Liability for Delay in Performance:** Servers.guru will not be liable for delays in its performance of the TOS or Servers.guru services caused by circumstances beyond Servers.guru’s reasonable control, including acts of God, wars, insurrection, civil commotions, riots, national disasters, earthquakes, strikes, fires, floods, water damage, explosions, shortages of labor or materials, labor disputes, transportation problems, accidents, embargoes, or governmental restrictions (collectively “Force Majeure”). Servers.guru will make reasonable efforts to reduce to a minimum and mitigate the effect of any Force Majeure. Notwithstanding anything contained elsewhere herein, lack of finances will not be considered an event of Force Majeure, nor will any event of Force Majeure suspend any obligation of customers for the payment of money due. Waiver and Amendment: Any waiver, modification, or amendment of any provision of the TOS or other agreement for Servers.guru services, initiated by a customer, will be effective only if accepted in writing and signed by an authorized representative of Servers.guru.

        1. Your use of and access to the platform or our services;
            
        2. Your violation of any provision of these Terms or the policies or agreements incorporated herein; and/or

    2. **Survival of Indemnification:** The indemnification obligations under this section shall survive any termination or expiration of these Terms or your use of the platform or our services.
        

13. **CUSTOMER RESPONSIBILITY**
    1. Customers are required to use the Servers.guru network responsibly. This includes respecting the other customers of Servers.guru. Servers.guru reserves the right to suspend and/or cancel service with any customer who uses the Servers.guru network in such a way that adversely affects other Servers.guru customers.
        
    2. While Servers.guru may monitor its service electronically to determine that its facilities are operating satisfactorily, as a general practice, Servers.guru does not monitor its customers’ communications or activities to determine whether they are in compliance with the TOS. However, when Servers.guru becomes aware of any violation of the TOS or other user agreements, Servers.guru may take any action to stop or correct such violation, including, but not limited to, denying access to Servers.guru’s services and equipment or to the Internet. Servers.guru anticipates that customers who offer Internet services will cooperate with Servers.guru in any corrective or preventive action that Servers.guru deems necessary.
        
    3. Failure to cooperate with such corrective or preventive measures is a violation of Servers.guru policy, and Servers.guru reserves the right to take any such action even though such action may affect other customers of the Servers.guru customer.
        

14. **ACTIONS TAKEN BY SERVERS.GURU**
    
    1. The failure by a customer to meet or follow any of the TOS is grounds for account deactivation. Servers.guru will be the sole arbiter as to what constitutes a violation of the TOS. Servers.guru reserves the right to remove any account without prior notice and to refuse service to anyone at any time.
        
    2. In case, we, through our operation of the Servers.guru platform, become aware of an alleged violation of its TOS, an investigation will be initiated. During this process, we may restrict access to services provided via the Servers.guru platform to prevent further potentially unauthorized activity. Depending on the severity of the violation, Servers.guru may, at its sole discretion, restrict, suspend, or terminate a customer’s web hosting account or VPS and/or pursue other civil remedies.
        
    3. If such violation is a criminal offense, Servers.guru will notify the appropriate law enforcement authorities of such violation. An unlisted activity may also be a violation of the TOS if it is illegal, irresponsible, or constitutes disruptive use of the Internet.
        
    4. Servers.guru does not issue credits for outages incurred through service disablement resulting from TOS violations. Servers.Guru does not issue refunds for banned customers due to TOS violations. Violators of the policy are responsible, without limitations, for the cost of labor to rectify any damage done to the operation of the network and business operations supported by the network and to respond to complaints incurred by Servers.guru.
        

15. **TERMINATION FOR BANKRUPTCY**
    
    1. If you become insolvent or any bankruptcy petition is filed by you or any third party against the customer, Servers.guru may immediately terminate the provision of Servers.guru’s services to you without prior notice or penalty. You consents to the grant of relief from any automatic stay of proceedings against Servers.guru in such event.
        

**MISCELLANEOUS**

16. **ASSIGNMENT**

    2. We may freely assign, transfer, or delegate any of our rights, interests, or obligations under these Terms without your consent.

17. **NO WAIVERS**
    1. Any failure or delay by either party to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. No waiver by either party of any term or condition set forth in these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition.
        
    2. Any waiver of any provision of these Terms must be in writing and signed by the waiving party. A waiver of any term or condition of these Terms shall only be effective for the specific instance and purpose for which it was given and shall not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or default.
        
    3. The parties agree that the exercise or non-exercise of any right or remedy under these Terms shall not preclude the exercise of any other right or remedy available under these Terms or at law or in equity.

    2. **Mandatory Arbitration:** Any claim, dispute, or controversy arising from or relating in any way to your purchase of products or services via the Site shall be resolved exclusively and conclusively by binding arbitration.
        
    3. **Arbitration Process:** The arbitration will be administered by American Association of Arbitration (AAA) in accordance with its rules then in effect, except as modified by this section of this Agreement. The arbitrator will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to arbitrability and/or enforceability of this arbitration provision. The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this section.
        
    4. **Individual Basis:** You agree to arbitration on an individual basis. In any dispute, neither you nor we will be entitled to join or consolidate claims by or against other customers in court or in arbitration or otherwise participate in any claim as a class representative, class member, or in a private attorney general capacity.
        
    5. **Class Arbitration Waiver:** The arbitral tribunal may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. Any challenge to the class arbitration waiver may only be raised in a court of competent jurisdiction.

21. **SEVERABILITY:** If any provision of these Terms is invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable, then that provision will be deemed severed from these Terms and will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions of these Terms.

However, Servers.guru makes NO warranty of any kind, either express or implied, regarding the quality, accuracy, reliability, validity, or continued existence of any or all aspects of such Technologies. Moreover, Servers.guru specifically disclaims all warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose for such Technologies. Furthermore, no customer will hold Servers.guru liable in any way for the revocation of any license, which has been licensed to Servers.guru. The use of the Technologies obtained from or through Servers.guru, or any other referred third party, whether directly or indirectly, is at the sole risk of customers.
