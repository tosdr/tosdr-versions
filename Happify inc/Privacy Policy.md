    When providing our Services, we may use the following types of cookies and tracking technologies for the purposes set out below.
    
    Cookies and local storage may be set and accessed on your computer. Upon your first visit to the Services, a cookie or local storage may be sent to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. “Cookies” and local storage are small files containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer's browser and stored on your device when you visit a website. Many major Web services use cookies to provide useful features for their users. Each Web site can send its own cookie to your browser. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent; however, if you reject cookies, you will not be able to sign into the Services or take full advantage of our Services. Additionally, if you clear all cookies on your browser at any point after setting your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent, you will have to again reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent.
    
    To support our Services, we may use one or more of the following cookies for the purposes set forth below:
    
    | Type of Cookie | Purpose |
    | --- | --- |
    | Analytics and Performance Cookies | These cookies are used to collect information about traffic to our Services and how users use our Services. The information gathered does not identify any individual visitor. The information is aggregated and therefore anonymous. It includes the number of visitors to our Services, the websites that referred them to our Services, the pages that they visited on our Services, what time of day they visited our Services, whether they have visited our Services before, and other similar information. We use this information to help operate our Services more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information and to monitor the level of activity on our Services. We use Google Analytics for this purpose. Google Analytics uses its own cookies. It is only used to improve how our Services work. You can find out more information about Google Analytics cookies here: [Find out more information about Google Analytics cookies](https://developers.google.com/analytics/resources/concepts/gaConceptsCookies). You can find out more about how Google protects your data here: [www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html](https://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html). You can prevent the use of Google Analytics relating to your use of our Services by downloading and installing the browser plugin available via this link: [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB) |
    | Essential Cookies | These cookies are essential to provide you with services available through our Services and to enable you to use some of its features. For example, they allow you to log in to secure areas of our Services and help the content of the pages you request load quickly. Without these cookies, the services that you have asked for cannot be provided, and we only use these cookies to provide you with those services. |
    | Functionality Cookies | These cookies allow our Services to remember choices you make when you use our Services, such as remembering your language preferences, remembering your login details, remembering which polls you have voted in and in some cases, to show you poll results, and remembering the changes you make to other parts of our Services which you can customize. The purpose of these cookies is to provide you with a more personal experience and to avoid you having to re-enter your preferences every time you visit our Services. |
    | Social Media Cookies | These cookies are used when you share information using a social media sharing button or “like” button on our Services or you link your account or engage with our content on or through a social networking website such as Facebook® or Twitter®. The social network will record that you have done this. |
    
    You can find more information about cookies and how they work, what cookies have been set on your computer or mobile device and how to manage and delete them at [http://www.allaboutcookies.org/](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/) and [www.youronlinechoices.com/uk](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk).
    
    We may also use “pixel tags,” which are small graphic files that allow us and third parties to monitor the use of the Services and collect Usage Data. A pixel tag can collect information such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the tag appears; the URL of the page on which the pixel tag appears; the time (and length of time) the page containing the pixel tag was viewed; the type of browser that retrieved the pixel tag; and the identification number of any cookie previously placed by that server on your computer.
    
    We may use pixel tags, either provided by us or by our third party advertisers, service providers and ad networks, to collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the links you click and other actions taken in connection with our sites and Services and use them in combination with our cookies to provide offers and information of interest to you. Pixel tags may also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit the Services or other websites.
    
    In addition, we may use a variety of other technologies that collect similar information for security and fraud detection purposes.
    
9. ### 9\. Location Information
    
    When you use the Site, Happify™ Offerings, the Services, or Promotions, and based on our legitimate interest to improve them, we may collect location information either provided by a mobile device interacting with our Site or one of our applications, or associated with your IP address, where we are permitted by law to process this information.
    
10. ### 10\. Aggregate Data
    
    Happify™ reserves the right to transfer and/or sell aggregate or group data about Happify™ users (including Usage Data not linked to Personal Information) for lawful purposes. Aggregate or group data is data that describes the demographics, usage or other characteristics of Happify™ users as a group, without disclosing personally identifiable information.
    
11. ### 11\. Mobile Devices
    
    One or more of our Apps may require that you be registered and signed in in order to use them. The information that we collect through your use of our Apps and tools will be treated as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. When you download and install one of our mobile Apps onto your mobile device, we assign a random number to your App installation. This number cannot be used to identify you personally, and we cannot identify you personally unless you choose to become a registered user of the App. We use this random number in a manner similar to our use of Cookies as described in this Privacy Policy. Unlike Cookies, the random number is assigned to your installation of the App itself and not a browser, because the App does not work through your browser. Therefore, the random number cannot be removed through settings. If you do not want us to use the random number for the purposes for which we use Cookies, please do not use our mobile device Apps. Because some of the content on our mobile device Apps directs your mobile device to our website you will be exposed to the Cookies that we use and to third party Cookies that may be contained in advertisements that we do not control and will be unable to delete any of these Cookies with your mobile device. Therefore, if you do not want to be exposed to Cookies when you use your mobile device you should not use our mobile device Apps and you should set your mobile device to reject Cookies when you use our mobile optimized sites. Our use of Cookies and Web Beacons on our mobile optimized sites are similar to our use on our desktop sites. Your choices to reject Cookies are available on our mobile optimized site. If you have questions about how to reject Cookies on your specific device please check with the device manufacturer.
    
12. ### 12\. Third-Party Websites
    
    This Site may contain links to third-party owned and/or operated websites. Happify™ is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. In some cases, you may be able to make a purchase through one of these third-party websites. In these instances, you may be required to provide certain information, such as a credit card number, to register or complete a transaction at such website. These third-party websites have separate privacy and data collection practices and Happify™ has no responsibility or liability relating to them.
    
13. ### 13\. Security
    
    We endeavor to safeguard and protect our Members’ Personal Information. When Members make Personal Information available to us, their Personal Information is protected both online and offline (to the extent that we maintain any Personal Information offline). The privacy of your Personal Information is very important to us. When our registration process asks users to submit Personal Information (if any), and when we transmit such Personal Information, that information is encrypted and is protected with the appropriate current industry standard software that employs state-of-the-art, best-practice encryption methods and algorithms.
    
    Access to your Personal Information is strictly limited, and we take reasonable measures to ensure that your Personal Information is not accessible to the public. The servers that we store Personal Information in are kept in a secure physical environment. We also have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of Personal Information under our control. Please be advised, however, that while we take every reasonable precaution available to protect your data, no storage facility, technology, software, security protocols or data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100%% secure. Computer hackers that circumvent our security measures may gain access to certain portions of your Personal Information, and technological bugs, errors and glitches may cause inadvertent disclosures of your Personal Information; provided, however, that any attempt to breach the security of the network, our servers, databases or other hardware or software constitutes a crime punishable by law. For the reasons mentioned above, we cannot warrant that your Personal Information will be absolutely secure. Any transmission of data at or through the Site is at your own risk.
    
    All of our Members’ Personal Information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees or third-party agents who need the Personal Information to perform a specific job are granted access to Personal Information. Our employees are dedicated to ensuring the security and privacy of all user Personal Information. Employees not adhering to our firm policies are subject to disciplinary action. In compliance with applicable federal and state laws or other laws applicable to persons using our Offerings in foreign countries, we shall notify you and any applicable regulatory agencies in the event that we learn of an information security breach with respect to your Personal Information. You will be notified via e-mail in the event of such a breach. Please be advised that notice may be delayed in order to address the needs of law enforcement, determine the scope of network damage, and to engage in remedial measures.
    
14. ### 14\. Information from users outside the U.S.A.
    
    The Services are operated in the United States of America. If you are located in another jurisdiction, please be aware that information you provide to us may be transferred to, stored and processed in the U.S.A. Except under Privacy Shield, by using the Services or providing us with any information, you consent to this transfer, processing, and storage of your information in the U.S.A., a jurisdiction in which the privacy laws may not be as comprehensive as those in the country where you reside or are a citizen. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
    
    Happify™ complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield.
    
    Happify™ has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to such data. If there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy policy and data subject rights under the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit [https://www.privacyshield.gov/](https://www.privacyshield.gov/).
    
    With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, Happify™ is subject to the regulatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.
    
    Pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, EU, UK and Swiss individuals have the right to obtain our confirmation of whether we maintain personal information relating to you in the United States. Upon request, we will provide you with access to the personal information that we hold about you. You may also correct, amend, or delete the personal information we hold about you.
    
    We will provide an individual opt-out choice, or opt-in for sensitive data, before we share your data with third parties other than our agents, or before we use it for a purpose other than which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized. To request to limit the use and disclosure of your personal information, please submit a written request to [support@happify.com](mailto:support@happify.com).
    
    In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. Happify™’s accountability for personal data that it receives in the United States under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party is described in the Privacy Shield Principles. In particular, Happify™ remains responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if third-party agents that it engages to process personal data on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless Happify™ proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
    
    In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, Happify™ commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information transferred to the United States pursuant to Privacy Shield. European Union and Swiss individuals with Privacy Shield inquiries or complaints should first contact Happify™ by email at [support@happify.com](mailto:support@happify.com).
    
    Happify™ has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the Privacy Shield Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit [https://www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/file-a-complaint/](https://www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/file-a-complaint/) consumers for more information and to file a complaint. This service is provided free of charge to you.
    
    If your Privacy Shield complaint cannot be resolved through the above channels, under certain conditions, you may invoke binding arbitration for some residual claims not resolved by other redress mechanisms.

    Initially, visitors to the Site may be offered a proprietary Happify™ “Happiness Assessment or “Track Recommender”.” Upon completion, Happify™ may invite the visitor to register on the Site to become a Member. Visitors also may register for membership or become members
    
    1. by and through their Facebook® account or Twitter® accounts,
    2. through a Happify Health™ program offered by various healthcare providers, health plans and/or employers (“Happify Health Program Companies”), or
    3. through any other means designated by Happify™.
    
    Happify™ reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to deny membership, as well as any Happify™ Offering, to anyone, for any reason whatsoever, as permitted by applicable law. The registration data that you must supply on the Site in order to obtain access to the Happify™ Offerings as a Member may include, without limitation, depending on the method used by you to register: full name; e-mail address; date of birth; home address; telephone number; user name and password; where you register via your Facebook® account, your: Facebook® ID; Facebook® profile name; Facebook® profile picture; education history (as included in your Facebook account); interests (as included in your Facebook® account); Facebook® photographs included in your Facebook® account; and any and all other information made available to Happify™ by and through your Facebook® account; where you register via your Twitter® account, your: Twitter® user ID; Twitter® profile name; Twitter® avatar; and any and all other information made available to Happify™ by and through your Twitter® account; information you submit or that we receive from your Happify Health Program Company when you access Happify™ through a program offered by such providers (such as, your GU I.D., employee or other employer-issued I.D., username, email address, telephone number); and any and all other information requested on the applicable registration form (collectively, “Registration Data”). You agree to provide true, accurate, current and complete Registration Data and to update your Registration Data as necessary to maintain it in an up to date and accurate fashion.

    You can access your specific Member account on the Site using your user name and password or logging in via your Facebook® account and/or Twitter® account, as applicable and where authorized by Happify™, or through the Happify Health program. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Member account, user name and password and for restricting access to your computer. You agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur through use of your Member account, user name and password.
    
    If you have reason to believe that your Member account is no longer secure (for example, in the event of a loss, theft or unauthorized disclosure or use of your user name, password, or any credit, debit or charge card number stored) you will notify Happify™ of the problem to avoid possible liability for any unauthorized charges to your account. To access and use some of our Services you will need to pay the applicable fees described on the Site for such Services, including applicable taxes (the “Subscription Fees”), unless you are accessing and using the Services through a program offered by a Happify Health Program Company, in which case the terms of payment, if any, will be established by the Happify Health Program Company. When you subscribe for Services requiring a payment, you hereby agree to pay the Subscription Fees, in accordance with billing terms in effect at the time the fee or charge becomes payable, and you agree to abide by the Terms and Conditions like any other user or Member.

We may also place limitations on the use of certain Services, content or features, and/or limit your access to parts of the Site or Services without notice or liability.
    
    Happify™ agrees that it will terminate any paid or unpaid subscription to Services upon notice from the Member. A Member's right to use the Site is subject to any limits established by Happify™ or by the Member's credit card issuer, unless the Member is using the Site through a Happify Health Program Company when other payment terms may apply. If payment cannot be charged to a Member's credit card or a Member's charge is returned for any reason, including chargeback, Happify™ reserves the right to either suspend or terminate the Member's access and account, thereby terminating this Agreement and all obligations of Happify™ hereunder.
    
    Happify™ may reject your application and/or terminate your membership at any time and for any reason, in our sole discretion. Such reasons may include, without limitation: where Happify™ believes that you are in any way in breach of the Agreement; and where Happify™ believes that you are, at any time, conducting any unauthorized commercial activity by and through the Services.

    Participating members are entitled to one week of private coaching without charge. If the member elects to continue with private coaching after the free trial, the member must select a payment plan, either monthly, quarterly or yearly.

    The coach will be available 5 days per week, Monday to Friday, and will respond to the user within 24 hours or the next business day if the communication is made on a Friday or before a holiday. The coach may be unavailable for 15 work days per year. If the coach should become permanently unavailable for any reason, the user will select another coach with comparable expertise.
    
    All communications with coaches shall be through electronic means, primarily text messaging through the Happify™ iOS app or the Happify™ website messaging interface, or through posts on the user’s bulletin board.
    
    All messages will be private, confidential and secure. The coach will be permitted to access the member’s user data, including happiness statistics, character strength assessment results, user posts and comments (public and private).
    
    By participating in the coaching program, you are consenting to the disclosure of this information to any coach with whom you are working. The coach is under a duty to maintain the confidentiality of this information and any other personal information you share with the coach, and the coach may not disclose this information to anyone else unless under a legal requirement to do so.
    
7. ### Payment Policy
    
    Access to some sections of the Happify™ website or through certain Happify programs is free, but we charge for some of our products and services on a subscription fee basis. This Payment Policy applies to users who have purchased a Happify™ subscription plan to access Happify™ either online or through a mobile application.
    
    1. Overview of Subscription Plans and Payments
        
        We offer several types of individual plans and gift plans. The pricing terms applicable to your account may vary depending on promotions, the type of subscription and the term you select at the time of purchase. Most of our subscription plans renew automatically, as described in more detail below. If you have questions regarding your plan after you sign up, please refer to your Membership page and the confirmation email that will be sent to you after your purchase.
        
        We may from time to time, at our discretion, offer a 30-day trial period for the yearly and two-year subscription plans, and if you sign up under that offer, you will not be billed for the full term until the end of the 30-day trial period. Note that trial periods are not available with the mobile subscription plans. After the end of any trial period, our mobile and online subscription plans are billed in one up-front payment for the entire term of the plan you choose. Thus, if you purchase a monthly plan, you will be charged for the full month’s payment at the beginning of each month; and if you purchase a yearly plan or two-year plan, you will be charged for the entire year or two-year term at the beginning of the term. You will also be able to cancel the yearly or two-year subscription within 30 days after the fee has been charged to your account, in accordance with our cancellation terms. We may use a third-party payment processor to facilitate your payments.
        
    2. Lifetime Subscription Plans
        
        Happify™ offers a Lifetime subscription plan. A Happify™ Lifetime subscription plan allows you to access the Happify™ services available at the time of your purchase for as long as those services are available. You may not assign a Lifetime subscription plan to any other person. Happify™ makes no warranties or representations that any of its services will continue to be available for any period of time, and in purchasing a Lifetime plan, you acknowledge and agree that the Happify™ services could change or terminate at any time in the future.
        
    3. Refund Policy
        
        Happify™ offers a 30-day, 100%% money - back guarantee for subscriptions made online at Happify.com for the yearly, two-year, and lifetime plans. The monthly plan is excluded from this offer as are subscriptions for mobile applications. You may receive a refund by contacting our Customer Service team within 30 days of your purchase. Requests made after 30 days will not be eligible. We do not prorate refunds or offer partial refunds except in an instance where we have terminated your membership for any reason other than your breach of our terms. Purchases of subscriptions made through the Apple iTunes Store or our iPhone or iPad applications are final, and are not eligible for a refund. These purchases are subject to Apple’s terms and payment policy, and Apple’s policy may exclude refunds as well.
        
        Purchases of subscriptions made through the Google Play Store or our Android applications are final, and are not eligible for a refund. These purchases are subject to Google Play's terms and payment policy, and Google Play's policy may exclude refunds as well.
        
    4. Renewals
        
        All Happify™ subscriptions made online at Happify.com, except gift purchases, renew automatically using the payment details on file for your account. If you purchase a subscription with the automatic renewal feature, you agree that we are authorized to use the payment information on file to charge the renewal fee.
        
        The date of automatic renewal of your subscription is shown on your Membership page and in the payment confirmation email sent after your initial purchase. You may cancel the automatic renewal feature at any time before the renewal date by following the instructions on your Membership page or by contacting our Customer Service team. Additionally, for annual and two - year subscriptions, we will refund renewal payments in full if you contact our Customer Service team within 7 days after the renewal payment is made. We do not offer refunds for renewal payments for monthly subscriptions after the monthly subscription fee has been charged to your account.
        
        If you signed up for our services using a promotion discount, fees for your renewal may be higher than your initial rate. Please refer to your Membership page or the confirmation email sent after your initial purchase for details regarding the renewal amount and the date of the next renewal.
        
    5. Price Increases
        
        Our prices may change in the future. We will notify you at the time of any price change, and provide you an opportunity to change or cancel your subscription before applying those changes to your account or changing your payment details in connection with an automatic renewal.
        
    6. Payment Information
        
        By providing payment information to us, you represent that the payment information is accurate, current and in your own name or in the name of an individual who has authorized you to use his or her payment information for your subscription purchase.
        
        If you provide someone else’s payment information, you agree that we may make a refund to that person if he or she so requests and if the account is eligible for a refund under our Payment Policy. This may cause interruption to or termination of your Happify™ Services.

13. ### Cash Reward Program
    
    Happify™ may from time to time offer cash rewards to select Members for participating in the certain Services and completing activities as outlined on the Member’s Cash Reward page.
    
    A Member may request payment equal to the cash balance of your Member account only as permitted by these Terms and Conditions. Redeeming your cash balance and receipt of any corresponding payment by you is contingent upon:
    
    1. your full compliance with these Terms and Conditions;
    2. our receipt of your request to convert the cash balance in your Member account to a payment,
    3. your establishing an account with PayPal to receive your payment, and
    4. your compliance with the specific rules and terms then in effect for the particular reward program.
    
    A Member may use only one Member account to participate in a cash reward program. Under no circumstances may a Member attempt to establish multiple accounts using multiple computers, names, or any program that masks the Member’s identity. All cash rewards are subject to review. Happify reserves the right to withhold, deny or cancel any cash rewards and/or terminate your Account if Happify, in its sole discretion, deems any cash rewards as fraudulent, abusive, unethical, suspicious or otherwise inconsistent with our cash rewards program terms, this Agreement or any other applicable law or regulation. For avoidance of doubt, faking completion of activities on Happify for cash rewards, will be disqualified from participation in the cash rewards program and their Account will be terminated. Happify decisions are final.
    
    1. Minimum Cash Request Amount  
        NO REDEMPTION OF CASH BALANCE UNTIL YOU HAVE AT LEAST TEN DOLLARS POSTED TO YOUR MEMBER ACCOUNT ($10.00) (the “minimum payment amount”). The terms “cash,” “dollars,” and similar terms are used interchangeably in this document and throughout our Services. Cash posted to your account is unearned and you have no right to redeem the “cash” in your account, and we have no liability or obligation to pay you, unless and until the amount posted to your account meets at least the minimum payment amount and you have otherwise complied with these Terms and Conditions. The “cash” in your account has no cash value and may be cancelled at any time pursuant to these Terms and Conditions.
    2. Requesting Payment/Required Account  
        You can request payment of the cash balance in your Member account, subject to these Terms and Conditions, by clicking the “Request Payment” link located on the Cash Reward page and completing all additional steps relating to verification of information and completion of request. As noted above, you may not request payment and the Cash in your account (which has no actual cash value) until at least the Minimum Payment Amount is posted to your account and the conditions herein are otherwise satisfied. A link to request payment will be displayed. Currently, the Minimum Payment Amount required when requesting a payment is $10.00; however, we reserve the right to change this amount. Members may have only one pending payment request at a time.  
        If a Member is eligible for a cash reward program, the Member will be responsible for establishing an account with PayPal. Happify™ will make payments to the PayPal account. Members are responsible for establishing a PayPal account and assuring that it is secure and reliable. Members must establish their own account. Happify™ will not make payments to third party accounts. Members should read and understand PayPal’s terms and rules. The same PayPal account cannot be used to claim a prize for multiple Member Accounts. Happify™ is not responsible for any actions taken by PayPal once payment has been made.
    3. Payment Schedule  
        Requests to process payment will be processed within ten (10) business days after the request is received. Happify™ does not permit more than one (1) payment request to be pending at any given time.  
        All payment requests are inspected immediately prior to processing. Payment requests made by inactive Members will not be processed. Accounts found to be in violation of these terms will have accounts closed and any payment request cancelled.
    4. Lost Payments  
        Happify™ is not responsible for any lost payments and will not replace payments allegedly converted or improperly accessed by third parties so long as such payment was sent to the PayPal account or email address provided to us when you signed up or provided to us at the time such payment was processed. If a payment that is processed for a Member is rejected due to an error in processing, we will re-send the payment after the Member provides us with accurate PayPal account information. We reserve the right to cancel a payment if rejected more than once or if we have reason to believe any of our terms have been violated.  
        You are responsible for usage of your account, whether or not authorized, including your log in, password and account information. Any violation of these terms or of site usage may result in the closure of your account and loss of eligibility to receive payments.
    5. Tax Matters  
        You are responsible for all tax liability arising from your receipt of payments under Happify™’s cash rewards program. We will require you to provide necessary tax information about yourself prior to receiving payment when requesting payment greater than $300 at one time or cumulatively during a calendar year. Happify™ will file a 1099 tax form with respect to any Member who earns $600 or more in one calendar year.
    6. Termination  
        Happify™ reserves the right to terminate the cash rewards program at any time, provided that if the Member has met the criteria and earned the cash rewards prior to termination of the program, the Member will be paid notwithstanding the termination of the program. Happify™ makes no guarantees regarding the number or dollar amount of cash rewards it will issue over the life of any cash reward program.

GDPR Commitment
---------------

1. ### 1\. Introduction
    
    As has been widely reported, the European Union has taken a large step in protecting the fundamental right to privacy for every EU resident with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which went into effect on 25th May 2018.
    
    EU residents will now have greater say over what, how, why, where, and when their personal data is used, processed, or disposed of. This rule clarifies how the EU personal data laws apply even beyond the borders of the EU. Any company that works with EU residents' personal data in any manner, irrespective of location, has obligations to protect the data.
    
    At Happify, we take the trust placed in us to strictly secure and protect our customers data very seriously and welcome the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).  We believe that every business should be held accountable to the same high standards to which we hold ourselves and appreciate these new measures of accountability that we can use to improve our practices.
    
2. ### 2\. Commitment
    
    We are fully committed to GDPR and have published updates to our [Privacy Policy](#privacy) and [Terms of Service.](#terms-and-conditions) The changes reflect the increased transparency requirements of the GDPR.
    
    As always, Happify is committed to protecting our users’ privacy. That will never change. These enhancements clarify and provide additional information about:
    
    * Our users’ privacy rights and how to exercise them;
    * How we collect, use, share and protect personal data;
    * How we operate in our capacity as a data processor acting on our users’ behalf.
    
    We will continue to actively monitor regulatory guidance and interpretations of key GDPR requirements to make sure we stay current with all legal requirements and privacy best practices.
    
    Individuals in the European Union may have a right to lodge a complaint regarding an alleged infringement of GDPR with the appropriate European Supervisory Authority, in particular in the Member State of his or her habitual residence or place of work. A list of Supervisory Authorities is available here: [https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members\_en](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en).
