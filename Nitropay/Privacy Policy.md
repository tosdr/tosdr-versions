* The categories of sources for the personal information we collected about you.
* Our business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information.
* The categories of third parties with whom we share that personal information.
* The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you (also called data portability request)

We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:

* Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or imposing penalties.
* Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.
