**Walgreens Privacy & Security Policy**

Last Updated: July 1, 2024

This Privacy Policy lets you know how we collect, use, share, and protect information about you. By interacting with Walgreens through our stores, websites, mobile applications, and any other Walgreens affiliate websites where you may interact with Walgreens, you consent to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. Any changes in our Privacy Policy will appear on this page so that you are aware of the data we collect and how we use it. We will notify you of material changes to this Privacy Policy by posting on our websites notification that the Privacy Policy has been revised and by updating the effective date of the Privacy Policy. For California, Colorado, Connecticut, Oregon, Texas, Virginia, and Utah residents, there is an ["Information for California Consumers"](#InformationforCaliforniaConsumers), ["Information for Colorado Consumers"](#InfoForColoradoConsumers), ["Information for Connecticut Consumers"](#InformationForConnecticutConsumers), ["Information for Oregon Consumers"](#InformationforOregonConsumers), ["Information for Texas Consumers"](#InformationforTexasConsumers), ["Information for Virginia Consumers"](#InformationforVirginiaConsumers), and ["Information for Utah Consumers"](#InformationforUtahConsumers) section in this Privacy Policy.

In some circumstances, Walgreens' use of your information will be subject to the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (commonly known as "HIPAA"). For example, if you log in to your pharmacy account and submit information regarding a prescription order, that information is subject to HIPAA's requirements. In those circumstances, the Walgreens [Notice of Privacy Practices](https://www.walgreens.com/topic/help/general/noticeprivacypractices.jsp) and not this Privacy Policy will apply. If you have questions about which policy applies to the information you have submitted, please do not hesitate to [Contact Us.](mailto:privacy.office@walgreens.com)

**Our Privacy Program**

At Walgreens, we are committed to maintaining our customers' privacy. We take great care to safeguard the information that we collect to maintain our customers' privacy. We have provided this Privacy Policy to you to describe information collection and use practices at Walgreens. This Privacy Policy describes the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

* * *

**Information We Collect**

We want you to understand how information you provide to us is collected and used. When you interact with Walgreens or use our services, we collect certain information about you and the services you use. An example of using our "services" would be when you visit one of our stores or websites. We may collect and store information from you in the following situations:

**Information you provide to us directly, including when you:**

* Make an in-store or online purchase, or other transaction with us;
* Create an account on one of our websites or mobile application;
* Participate in our loyalty programs;
* Participate in a contest, sweepstake, promotion, or survey;
* Correspond directly with us, such as through our websites, postal mail, customer service, or dispute resolution mechanisms; or
* Post a review or comment on one of our websites, or post other user-generated content on one of our websites or mobile application.

**Information we collect when you use our services, including:**

**Identifiers:** such as name, address, telephone number, email address, age, date of birth, username and password for our websites, online identifiers, IP address.  
**Commercial information:** such as products or services purchased, obtained or considered, other purchasing or consuming histories or tendencies, payment information, health and medical information, health insurance information, loyalty program participation information.  
**Inferences:** such as consumer preferences, characteristics, predispositions, and behavior.  
**Biometric Information:** such as facial scans for safety, security, and product feature purposes.

**Device Information**

* We may collect device-specific information when you visit our websites or use our mobile applications or services. This includes information such as Internet Protocol (IP) address, hardware model, operating system, unique device identifiers, mobile network information, location data such as zip code, the address of referring websites, the path you take through our websites, and other information about your session on our websites. We may also associate the information we collect from your different devices, which helps us provide consistent services across your devices.

**Log Information**

* This includes details of how you used our websites or mobile applications including clicks and page information such as the address (or URL) of the website or mobile application you came from before visiting our website or mobile application, which pages you visit on our website or mobile application, which browser you used to view our website or mobile application, and any search terms entered.
* Other information from your interaction with our websites, services, content and advertising, including computer and connection information, statistics on page views, traffic to and from the websites, ad data and other standard weblog information.

**Precise Location Information**

* When you use our services on your mobile phone or device and enable location services on your mobile phone or device browser, we may collect information about your physical location through satellite, cell phone tower, WiFi signal, beacons, Bluetooth and near field communication protocols ("precise location information"). If you use our mobile application, your device may share precise location information when you enable location services for our application. To learn how to opt-out of sharing your precise location information with Walgreens, go to the ["Your Choices"](#YourChoices) section of this Privacy Policy. When you use our mobile application, we may also request access to your Bluetooth signal from your device. If you enable our mobile application to use your Bluetooth signal, we may be able to determine your device's in-store location. To learn how to opt-out of sharing your device's Bluetooth signal with Walgreens, go to the ["Your Choices"](#YourChoices) section of this Privacy Policy.
* We may also collect certain precise location information that may be considered "precise geolocation" under state law. Please see the ["Information for California Consumers"](#InformationforCaliforniaConsumers), ["Information for Connecticut Consumers"](#InformationForConnecticutConsumers), ["Information for Oregon Consumers"](#InformationforOregonConsumers), ["Information for Texas Consumers"](#InformationforTexasConsumers), ["Information for Virginia Consumers"](#InformationforVirginiaConsumers), and ["Information for Utah Consumers"](#InformationforUtahConsumers) sections for additional information on precise geolocation.

**Cameras**

* We use cameras in and around our stores for security purposes and for operational purposes such as measuring traffic patterns and tracking in-stock levels.

**Interactive Services**

These third parties may collect information about your use of our services over time and that information may be combined with information collected on different websites and online services.

However, you may set your Web browser to not accept new cookies or web beacons, be notified when you receive a new cookie, or disable cookies altogether.

We will verify each member of the household using the verification criteria explained below.
* **Verification of Requests.** Our verification process depends on the type of request you submit to exercise a California Consumer Right as described above.  
      
    Access and Correction Requests  
      
    For Access and Correction requests, you will enter a two-part verification process. You must verify your identity by correctly answering demographic questions powered through LexisNexis® and confirm control over the email address you provide in the request form. If you successfully complete the LexisNexis® demographic questions and email confirmation, you will proceed to part two of the process in which we will attempt to match the data provided in the request form to the data we maintain. If you are matched to a reasonably high degree of certainty, your request will be processed as follows:  
      
    
    * **Access request:** Your access report will include the specific pieces of CA Personal Information not otherwise subject to an exception pursuant to law that we match to you. If requested, your access report will also be provided in a portable, machine-readable format.
    * **Correction request:** If we determine the contested data to be inaccurate based on the totality of the circumstances, unless otherwise subject to an exception pursuant to law, your data will be corrected.
    
    If you fail the LexisNexis® demographic questions but successfully complete email confirmation, you proceed to part two of the process in which we will attempt to match the data provided in the request form to the data we maintain. If you are matched to a reasonable degree of certainty, your request will be processed as follows:  
      
    
    * **Access request:** Your access report will include the categories of CA Personal Information we match to you unless otherwise subject to an exception pursuant to law.
    * **Correction request:** Your correction request cannot be processed if you fail the LexisNexis® demographic questions.
    
    If you fail both LexisNexis® and email confirmation, your Access or Correction request will be cancelled, and you will be notified.  
      
    Deletion and Appeal Requests  
      
    For Deletion and Appeal requests, you must confirm control over the email address you provide in the request form. If you successfully complete email confirmation, we will attempt to match the data provided in the request form to the data we maintain. If you are matched to a reasonably high degree of certainty, your request will be processed as follows:  
      
    
    * **Deletion request:** All data matched to you and not otherwise subject to an exception pursuant to law will be deleted.
    * **Appeal request:** Your appeal request will be reviewed, and you will receive a communication with the outcome of the appeal, including any additional rights you may have.
    
    If you are matched to a reasonable degree of certainty, your request will be processed as follows:  
      
    
    * **Deletion request:** Certain limited data we associate to you will be deleted.
    * **Appeal request:** We will review your appeal request and, after considering the totality of the circumstances, will respond accordingly.
    
    If you fail email confirmation, your Deletion or Appeal request will be cancelled, and you will be notified.  
      
    Opt-Out Requests and Requests to Limit  
      
    Requests to opt-out of profiling or sale and sharing of your CA Personal Information and requests to limit the use and disclosure of your Sensitive Personal Information do not require LexisNexis® verification or email confirmation.

**Nondiscrimination.** Should you wish to request the exercise of your rights as detailed above with regard to your CA Personal Information, we will not discriminate against you. To the extent you provide CA Personal Information in connection with programs such as myWalgreens, additional information about the terms applicable to those programs, including our use of CA Personal Information in exchange for the applicable financial incentives, can be found in the terms and conditions for those programs and in the Notice of Financial Incentive section above.

**No Sale of Minors' Personal Information.** Additionally, California law requires California residents under the age of 16 to opt-in to the sale or sharing of CA Personal Information. We have protections in place to prevent the sale and sharing of, and do not intend to and have no actual knowledge that we "sell" or "share" the CA Personal Information of California residents under the age of 16. As a result, certain programs and services may be unavailable to California residents under the age of 16.

**Metrics.** California law requires recording of metrics regarding requests for Access, Correction, Deletion, Opting-out of Sale/Sharing, and Limiting the use of Sensitive Personal Information submitted by California residents pursuant to the California Privacy Rights Act. The metrics below reflect the time period from January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023.

|     | **Access** | **Correction** | **Deletion** | **Opt out of Sale/Sharing** | **Request to Limit** |

If you are a Colorado resident, we are required to provide additional information to you about how we collect, use and disclose your information that may be considered "Personal Data " under Colorado Law ("CO Personal Data"), and you may have additional rights with regard to how we use and disclose your CO Personal Data. In addition, certain information about you may be considered “Sensitive Data” under Colorado Law, and, unless the processing falls under a legal exception, we cannot process Sensitive Data without obtaining your consent. We have included this Colorado-specific information below.

* **myWalgreens Loyalty Program.** If you enroll and participate in the myWalgreens Loyalty Program, the following information about how we collect, use and disclose your CO Personal Data applies.

* The categories of CO Personal Data collected from participants of the myWalgreens Loyalty Program include those listed under the “CO Processing” section below and the categories of CO Personal Data sold or processed for targeted advertising include those listed below under the “CO Sale and Targeted Advertising” section.

* We partner with Synchrony Bank to offer the myWalgreens credit card to myWalgreens loyalty members. As a loyalty member, you can apply for the myWalgreens credit card online or in our stores.
* If you request deletion of your CO Personal Data and are a myWalgreens loyalty member, your loyalty profile may be deleted. We use your loyalty profile to provide myWalgreens loyalty program benefits to you as a loyalty member. Without a loyalty profile, you would lose myWalgreens Cash rewards and other benefits such as sales prices in-store and online, personalized offers, and paperless coupons.

* **CO Processing.** Consistent with the ["Information We Collect"](#InformationWeCollect) section above, we process certain categories and specific pieces of CO Personal Data about individuals who reside in Colorado.

**Profiling Activities.** Consistent with the "myWalgreens Loyalty Program" section above, we process certain categories of CO Personal Data from myWalgreens loyalty members in a manner that may be considered “profiling” under Colorado law, such as prescreened credit card offers. For myWalgreens loyalty members that have identifiers such as name and address populated in their loyalty account, our business partner, Synchrony Bank, may process those identifiers to complete a prequalification check for the myWalgreens credit card. This processing occurs at the point of sale, either in-store or online, and involves a soft credit check by Synchrony Bank to determine loyalty members’ eligibility for a credit card preapproval offer. If deemed eligible, you may receive a myWalgreens credit card preapproval offer at the point of sale. Those that are deemed ineligible may not receive a myWalgreens credit card preapproval offer at the point of sale but may still apply for a myWalgreens credit card online or in-person at any Walgreens or Duane Reade store. You may stop our processing of your CO Personal Data for these purposes by opting-out of profiling.

**Information for Oregon Consumers**

If you are an Oregon resident, we are required to provide additional information to you about how we collect, use and disclose your information that may be considered "Personal Data" under Oregon Law (**"OR Personal Data"**), and you may have additional rights with regard to how we use and disclose your OR Personal Data. In addition, certain information about you may be considered “Sensitive Data” under Oregon Law, and, unless the processing falls under a legal exception, we cannot process Sensitive Data without obtaining your consent. We have included this Oregon-specific information below.

* **Processing.** Consistent with the ["Information We Collect"](#InformationWeCollect) section above, we process certain categories and specific pieces of OR Personal Data about individuals who reside in Oregon. In the 12 months prior to the date of this Privacy Policy, we collected the following types of categories of OR Personal Data, which we will continue to collect:

* **Identifiers:** such as name, address, telephone number, email address, age, date of birth, username and password for our websites, online identifiers, IP address;
* **Commercial information:** such as products or services purchased, obtained or considered, other purchasing or consuming histories or tendencies, payment information, health and medical information, health insurance information, loyalty program participation information;
* **Internet or other electronic network activity information:** such as computer and connection information, statistics on page views, traffic to and from the websites, ad data and other standard weblog information;
* **Geolocation information:** including location data and precise location data such as physical location information through the use of our services on your mobile phone or device by, for example using satellite, cell phone tower, WiFi signal, beacons, Bluetooth and near field communication protocols, when you are in or near a Walgreens store;

**Profiling Activities.** We process certain categories of OR Personal Data from myWalgreens loyalty members in a manner that may be considered “profiling” under Oregon law, such as prescreened credit card offers. For myWalgreens loyalty members that have identifiers such as name and address populated in their loyalty account, our business partner, Synchrony Bank, may process those identifiers to complete a prequalification check for the myWalgreens credit card. This processing occurs at the point of sale, either in-store or online, and involves a soft credit check by Synchrony Bank to determine loyalty members’ eligibility for a credit card preapproval offer. If deemed eligible, you may receive a myWalgreens credit card preapproval offer at the point of sale. Those that are deemed ineligible may not receive a myWalgreens credit card preapproval offer at the point of sale but may still apply for a myWalgreens credit card online or in-person at any Walgreens or Duane Reade store. You may stop our processing of your OR Personal Data for these purposes by opting-out of profiling. You can do so by submitting an opt-out request through this link [here](https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/e56ed7f6-6f9b-4d8c-b480-6fd18a73178b/2bf4e837-9c6c-4bdb-81fe-ef068f2008a0) or by contacting us at 800-925-4733.
