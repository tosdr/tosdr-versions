Welcome to Walgreens! Please take a few minutes to read these important terms and conditions ("Terms").

IMPORTANT ARBITRATION NOTICE: PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS. THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CONTAIN A MANDATORY ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND A CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER, REQUIRING ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND WALGREENS, SUBJECT TO LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, TO BE RESOLVED BY FINAL AND BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND REQUIRING YOU TO FOREGO JURY TRIALS, CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS, AND ALL OTHER TYPES OF COURT PROCEEDINGS OF ANY KIND. UNLESS YOU OPT OUT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE OPT-OUT PROCEDURES IN SECTION II BELOW, YOU WILL BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE (AS DEFINED BELOW). YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND AND EXPRESSLY AGREE TO THE MANDATORY ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER SET FORTH HEREIN.

I. Introduction
---------------

These Terms govern your use of the online services provided by Walgreen Co. and its affiliates ("Walgreens," "us," or "we"), including websites, mobile applications, photo services, Rx reminders, in-store wifi, Walgreens Content (as defined in Section III), and other services ("Services"). The Services are intended for use by users that reside in the U.S. and are 18 or older (or 13 or older, with the consent and involvement of a parent or guardian). If you are not the intended audience or you object to these Terms, you may not use our Services. These Terms act as a binding agreement between you and us, and by accessing any Services in any way, you agree to be bound by all of them, including, but not limited to, **resolving disputes via binding individual arbitration**, conducting this transaction electronically, disclaiming warranties, damage and remedy exclusions and limitations, and a choice of **Illinois law**.

From time to time we may update the Services and these Terms. Your use of the Services after we post any changes to these Terms constitutes your agreement to those changes. You agree to review these Terms periodically to ensure that you are familiar with the most recent version. We may, in our sole discretion, and at any time, discontinue the Services or any part thereof, with or without notice, or may prevent your use of the Services with or without notice to you. You agree that you do not have any rights in the Services and that we will have no liability to you if the Services are discontinued or your ability to access the Services (including any content you may have posted) is terminated.

II. Dispute Resolution: Binding Individual Arbitration & Waiver of Class/Representative Actions and Jury Trials ("Agreement to Arbitrate")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The informal resolution and binding individual arbitration requirements in this Section II apply to all Disputes between you and Walgreens. "Dispute"** means any dispute, claim, or controversy (excluding those exceptions listed below) between you and Walgreens, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, that either party seeks legal recourse for, and irrespective of whether the Dispute relates to the Services or to your experiences in or purchases from any Walgreens physical store. In Disputes involving minors, claims asserted by the minor(s) and by the minor’s or minors’ parent(s) or guardian(s) are subject to this agreement to arbitrate. **A Dispute is subject to this Agreement to Arbitrate, whether it arose before, on, or subsequent to you entering these Terms, and if not resolved through the informal dispute resolution procedure outlined below, shall be exclusively resolved by individual, binding arbitration in accordance with this Agreement to Arbitrate.** The scope of Disputes delegated to the arbitrator to decide shall be construed as broadly as applicable law allows, and explicitly extends to Disputes relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this Agreement to Arbitrate, including any claim that all or any part of the Terms, including this Agreement to Arbitrate, is void or voidable. The arbitrator shall also be responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether any part of the Terms are unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including waiver, delay, laches, or estoppel. The sole exceptions to the requirement to arbitrate Disputes are (1) you and Walgreens each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights; (2) Disputes may be brought as individual actions in small claims court in the jurisdiction where you reside, if that small claims court has jurisdiction to hear the Dispute; and (3) procedural issues that this Agreement to Arbitrate expressly says are for a court to decide, such as whether a party complied with pre-dispute informal resolution requirements.

Unless otherwise prohibited by law, the arbitrator may award relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief necessitated by that party's individual claim(s).

In the event of a Dispute, you and Walgreens will attempt to resolve the Dispute informally before an arbitration is filed. For one of us to notify the other of a Dispute, we must send a written notice of such Dispute (a "Notice of Dispute") stating the name, address, and contact information of the party giving notice; the facts giving rise to such Dispute; and the relief requested. You must send any Notice of Dispute by mail to Walgreen Co. c/o Illinois Corporation Service Company, 801 Adlai Stevenson Drive, Springfield, IL 62703. We will send any Notice of Dispute to you at the email address or mailing address we have for you, if any. All statutes of limitations applicable to the Dispute will be considered tolled beginning on the day one of us sends a compliant Notice of Dispute to the other. You and Walgreens agree to attempt in good faith to resolve any Dispute through informal negotiation for 60 days after the notice of such Dispute is sent. After the end of that 60-day period and not before, you or Walgreens may commence an arbitration proceeding as set forth in this Agreement to Arbitrate. If you or Walgreens proceeds to arbitration without having provided a compliant Notice of Dispute and waiting until the conclusion of the 60-day negotiation period, a court may enjoin the filing and order the party that has not followed this mandatory informal resolution process to reimburse the other party for any arbitration fees and costs already incurred. The compliance of a Notice of Dispute with these Terms, including whether a Notice of Dispute contained all required information, is an issue to be decided by a court. We hope you will try informal resolution with Walgreens before bringing an individual action in small claims court, but informal resolution is mandatory only as a prerequisite to arbitration.

These Terms affect interstate commerce, so the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq., governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate, which shall be conducted by National Arbitration and Mediation ("NAM"), [https://namadr.com,](https://namadr.com/) according to NAM's Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures in effect at the time the Dispute arose.

Instructions for filing a Demand for Arbitration with NAM are available on the NAM website or by emailing NAM at [commercial@namadr.com.](mailto:commercial@namadr.com) Walgreen Co. C/O Illinois Corporation Service Company, 801 Adlai Stevenson Drive, Springfield, IL 62703. Walgreens will send any Demand for Arbitration to the email address and to any billing address you have provided us, if any.

You and Walgreens both agree that the arbitration will be conducted in the English language. The arbitrator will apply all applicable contractual terms as a court would and will adjudicate any Disputes according to applicable law and fact based only upon the record before the arbitrator.

For Disputes in which the claimant seeks less than USD $10,000, the arbitrator will decide the matter solely on the basis of written submissions, without a formal hearing, unless the arbitrator decides that a formal hearing is necessary. For matters in which the claimant seeks USD $10,000 or more, or smaller matters in which the arbitrator determines a hearing to be necessary, hearings shall be conducted by video or telephone, unless the arbitrator determines an in-person hearing to be necessary. If an in-person hearing is required and you reside in the United States, the hearing will take place in Chicago, Illinois, unless the arbitrator determines that this would pose a hardship for the claimant, in which case the in-person hearing may be conducted in the claimant’s state and county of residence. If you reside outside the United States, the site of any in-person hearing will be determined by the applicable Rules. Unless you and Walgreens agree otherwise, any decision or award will include a written statement stating the decision of each claim and the basis for the award, including the arbitrator’s essential factual and legal findings and conclusions.

**Coordinated Filings**

If 20 or more Notices of Disputes are sent that raise similar claims and have the same or coordinated counsel, these will be considered **"Coordinated Cases"** and will be treated as mass filings or multiple case filings according to the Rules, if and to the extent Coordinated Cases are filed in arbitration as set forth in this Agreement. Walgreens or you may advise the other of its or your belief that cases are Coordinated Cases, and disputes over whether a case or cases meet the contractual definition of "Coordinated Cases" will be decided by the arbitration provider as an administrative matter. **Demands for Arbitration in Coordinated Cases shall only be filed with the arbitration provider as permitted by the bellwether process set forth below. Applicable statutes of limitations will be tolled for claims asserted in a Coordinated Case from the time a compliant Notice of Dispute has been received by a party until, under the terms of this Agreement, the Coordinated Case may be filed in arbitration or court.**

Once counsel in the Coordinated Cases has advised Walgreens that all or substantially all of the Notices of Dispute have been provided, counsel for the parties shall confer in good faith regarding the number of cases that should proceed in arbitration as bellwethers, to allow each side to test the merits of its arguments. If counsel for the parties do not agree on the number of bellwethers, an even number shall be chosen by the arbitration provider as an administrative matter (or, in the arbitration provider’s discretion, by a process arbitrator). Factors that the arbitration provider may consider in making this decision include the complexity of the dispute and differences in facts or applicable laws among various cases. Once the number of bellwethers is fixed, by agreement or by the arbitration provider, each side shall select half that number from among the claimants who have provided compliant Notices of Dispute, and **only** those chosen cases may be filed with the arbitration provider. The parties acknowledge that resolution of some Coordinated Cases will be delayed by this bellwether process.

Unless the parties agree otherwise, each bellwether trial should be assigned to a different arbitrator.

Once all bellwether trials have concluded (or sooner if the counsel for the claimants and Walgreens agree), the parties must engage in a single mediation of all remaining Coordinated Cases, with each side paying half the applicable mediation fee. Walgreens and counsel for the claimants must agree on a mediator within 30 days after the conclusion of the last bellwether trial. If counsel for Walgreens and claimants cannot agree on a mediator within 30 days, the arbitration provider will appoint a mediator as an administrative matter. Walgreens and counsel for the claimants will cooperate for the purpose of ensuring that the mediation is scheduled as quickly as practicable after the mediator is appointed.

If the mediation does not yield a global resolution, this arbitration requirement shall no longer apply to Disputes that are the subject of Coordinated Cases for which a compliant Notice of Dispute was received by the other party but that were not resolved in bellwether proceedings. Such Disputes may be filed only in state court in Cook County, Illinois, or if federal jurisdiction exists, only in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, and you consent as part of the Terms to venue such cases exclusively in these courts. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as prohibiting either you or Walgreens from removing a case from state to federal court if removal is allowed under applicable law. To the extent you are asserting the same claims as other persons and are represented by common or coordinated counsel, you agree to waive any objection that the joinder of all such persons is impracticable. If a formerly arbitrable Dispute is brought in court, claimants may seek class treatment, but to the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, the classes sought may comprise only the claimants in the Coordinated Cases who provided compliant Notices of Dispute, and any party may contest class certification at any stage of the litigation and on any available basis.

A court shall have authority to enforce this bellwether process and may enjoin the filing of lawsuits or arbitration demands not made in compliance with it.

**Choice of Law.** The arbitrator will decide all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of Illinois, without regard to its choice of law principles, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different Walgreens users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same Walgreens user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

**Opt-Out Procedures.** You can choose to reject the Agreement to Arbitrate by mailing us a signed opt-out notice ("Opt-Out Notice") within 30 days after the date you first access the Services or accept any subsequently published version of these Terms. The Opt-Out Notice must include a statement that you do not agree to this Agreement to Arbitrate, your name, address, phone number, and any email address(es) used to log in to any applicable account(s) to which the opt-out applies. You must mail the Opt-Out Notice to Walgreens, Attn: Litigation and Regulatory Law Department, 104 Wilmot Road, MS 1431, Deerfield, IL 60015. This procedure is the only way you can opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate. If you opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate, all other parts of these Terms, including all other provisions of this Section, will continue to apply. Opting out of this Agreement to Arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with us.

To the extent permitted by applicable law, any claims arising in connection with the use of the Services or these Terms must be filed within one (1) year of the date of the event giving rise to such action.

This Section II shall survive any expiration or termination of your relationship with Walgreens. Although Walgreens may revise the Terms in its discretion, Walgreens does not have the right to alter the Terms to arbitrate or the rules specified herein with respect to any Dispute once that Dispute arises, if such change would make arbitration procedures less favorable to the claimant. Whether charged procedures are less favorable to the claimant is an issue to be decided by the arbitrator, and if multiple claimants are proceeding in Coordinated Cases, the applicability of revised terms to the Coordinated Cases will be decided by the arbitration provider as a process matter.

**Severability.** If all or any provision of this Section II is found invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then you and Walgreens agree that the provision will be severed, and the rest shall remain in effect and be construed as if any severed provision had not been included. The sole exception is that if the prohibition on class arbitrations is found invalid, unenforceable, or illegal as to a Dispute, you and Walgreens agree that this entire Agreement to Arbitrate is null and void as to that Dispute and that such Dispute will be resolved in court subject to the venue and choice of law clauses specified in these Terms. Under no circumstances does Walgreens consent to arbitrate a Dispute using class arbitration procedures.

**Class Action Waiver.** To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, for any matter not subject to the requirement to arbitrate (except to the limited extent discussed above for Coordinated Cases), including if you have opted out of the arbitration requirement, you and Walgreens will only bring claims against the other in an individual capacity and shall not (1) seek to bring, join, or participate in any class or representative action, collective or class-wide arbitration, or any other action where another individual or entity acts in a representative capacity (like private attorney general actions); or (2) consolidate or combine individual proceedings or permit another to do so without the express consent of all parties.
