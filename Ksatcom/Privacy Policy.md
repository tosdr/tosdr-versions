#### General

Unless varied by the terms or privacy policy posted on a particular website or provided to you as part of your relationship with GMG, the privacy practices described below apply to all personal information collected by GMG. This includes information collected through any websites, mobile applications, widgets, tools, features, and content (including videos and images) that we may offer or employ on any platform (collectively, the “Services”) that is owned or managed by GMG. This policy does not apply to information collected by third parties, including through any platform or content that may link to or be accessible from any of our websites.

Included below is an overview of our approach to privacy:

* We collect information about you to provide you with the best experience using our media platforms or accessing other Services we provide.
    
* We do not make money by selling your information to third parties.
    
* We only give third-parties access to your information when it is necessary to provide you with the Services we make available or because you have asked us to do so.
    

You have choices with how we use the information we collect and maintain about you and can ask us to update or remove that information at any time.

This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and made part of the [Terms of Use](https://www.grahammedia.com/terms/) which govern your use of the Services we provide.

#### Information We Collect

While legal definitions of personal information or personal data can vary in different jurisdictions, we consider “personal information” to be any information that identifies you as an individual or is directly linkable to you as an identifiable individual. Not all information we collect is personal information under this definition. For example, information that has been de-identified or aggregated in a way that no longer allows identification of a particular person would not meet this definition. Similarly, information we gather about you from publicly available sources, such as government databases, may not be considered personal information in your jurisdiction. Where permitted, we may combine personal information that you have given us with publicly available information about you to create a profile about you, your interests, and your preferences that helps us personalize your experience of the Services.

We may collect, store, and process personal information from various categories. These categories include:

* **Identifiers**: This may include your name, address, physical telephone number; email address, and date of birth.
    
* **Demographic information**: This may include your gender and/or age.
    
* **Internet or other electronic network activity:** This may include browsing information, site navigation data, referring source (including referring URLs), exit URL, browser type, browser identifier, IP address and other similar information collected via cookies and other online tracking technologies.
    
* **Audio, visual, or similar information:** This may include photos, videos or other recordings you choose to share with us.
    
* **Geolocation data**: This may include geolocation data from your computer or phone (e.g., to provide live weather radar maps).
    
* **Commercial information**: This may include records of products or services purchased, obtained, or considered, payment methods, or other purchasing or consuming histories or tendencies.
    
* **Inferences**: This may include profiles created about you that reflect your interests and preferences.
    

**Our listing of these categories does not mean that all categories or examples listed in each category are collected about everyone who uses the Services. We are providing a complete list in the spirit of transparency.**

We collect this information:

* Directly from you when you provide it to us, for example, by signing up for an Insider account, submitting an inquiry or comment to us online or via email, or providing us with your contact information to receive news and weather alerts.
    
* We may supplement the information you provide directly with information received or otherwise obtained from third parties. This information may be received or obtained from our partners in sponsored content sections of the Services or from other third parties who provide us with user group and audience data they have compiled based on factors such as age, gender, geography, interests, and online activity. For example, we may receive information about you from a social media site if you connect to the Services through that site.
    
* Automatically when you visit or use our Services or interact with us in other ways through cookies (small text files containing a string of characters sent to your computer) and similar tracking technologies (such as web beacons or pixels) that tell us which pages were visited and by how many users, the order in which pages were visited, and which hyperlinks were “clicked.” Not all of this information is personal information, as we define it above. Information collected by these technologies can be necessary for site navigation and performance or, in some instances, used by our business partners or us for targeted advertising purposes.
    

* Certain of our sites employ a tool from data-privacy software provider [Osano](https://protect-us.mimecast.com/s/57zmCVOr91u2mOw2Sz9nVJ?domain=osano.com/ "https://www.osano.com/") that allows you to customize your cookie preferences. Where we make that tool available, you can access it to change your preferences anytime by clicking the Cookie Preferences link located at the bottom of any of our web pages. The tool will record when you have acknowledged our use of cookies and will periodically prompt you to consider your choices to ensure you stay up to date with changes to our privacy practices. The tool controls the marketing and analytical cookies set by using the Services. Essential cookies cannot be disabled from the cookies tool. All users may have additional options to control how and whether cookies and similar technologies will be accepted through settings available from your chosen web browser. For more information on how to change these settings, please refer to your browser help menu. Be aware that if you choose to disable cookies at the web browser level, some features of the Services may not function properly or be accessible to you.
    

The Services may contain links to other websites, including the websites of our sponsors and partners. These third-party websites may collect information directly from you or set cookies or other tracking tools on your device. We are not responsible for the privacy practices these third parties employ when you visit their websites. If you have any questions about an advertisement or other targeted content received from a third party, you should contact the responsible provider directly.

#### How We Use the Information Collected

The specific local media hub or other GMG entity that collects your personal information will generally be the primary user of information collected from you. This includes using that information on Services that might be on different platforms than the platform through which the information was initially provided. Other GMG entities may access your information where they perform services on behalf of the collecting entity, unless prohibited under applicable law, for use on their behalf for the purposes described in this privacy policy. Consistent with applicable law and the choices and controls that may be available to you, we may use information collected from you or from devices associated with you as follows:

* _To Provide and Manage the Products and Services You Request_. This includes, for example, creating and maintaining your local media Insider account, processing your subscription, sending you confirmation notices regarding services you have requested, delivering localized weather and news alerts consistent with your choices, and notifying contest or sweepstakes winners. This may also include using your personal information to personalize and improve your experience on our Services.
    
* _To Contact You_. We may periodically contact you with information about upcoming events and programs or other content that might interest you. You may opt out of receiving commercial email messages from us by following the instructions contained in those email messages.
    
* _To Better Understand Our Users and Improve Our Services_. We may collect information on our users’ demographics, interests, and behavior and analyze that data. We do this to better understand and serve our users and to improve our products and Services.
    
* _To Deliver Targeted Advertising_. We may use your information, including your location information, to facilitate the delivery of targeted ads, promotions, and offers to you, on behalf of ourselves and advertisers, on and off the Services.
    
* _To Protect the Services and the Rights of Users and Others_. We may use your personal information as we believe is necessary or appropriate to protect, enforce, or defend the legal rights, privacy, and safety of property displayed on the Services, our employees or agents, or other users, and comply with applicable law.
    
* _In Limited Circumstances With Your Consent_. We may obtain your consent to process personal information for other specified purposes.
    
* _To Comply with Legal Obligations, Resolve Disputes and Enforce Agreements_. For example, to notify you regarding any concerns with the Services, including, as required by law, if personal information you provided to us is exposed to unauthorized third parties.
    

When we sponsor promotions or sweepstakes, or third parties’ sponsor promotions or sweepstakes in conjunction with us, either the third party or we will post any additional relevant privacy information in the official rules and/or registration area for the promotion or sweepstakes. To the extent it conflicts with this Privacy Policy, that privacy information will govern that promotion or sweepstakes.

#### How We Share Your Information

The categories of personal information that we may have shared for a business or commercial purpose include any of the categories of personal information shown in the Information We Collect section of this Privacy Policy.

**_We process certain categories of personal information for purposes of targeted advertising. Those include identifiers, demographic information, Internet browsing or other electronic network activity information, geolocation data, and inferences drawn from the above. We may share these categories of personal information with our affiliates, business partners, and certain service providers. You may opt out of this type of sharing by using the form here:_** 

Select Your Station - Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information Form KPRC (Houston, TX) KSAT (San Antonio, TX) WDIV (Detroit, MI) WJXT (Jacksonville, FL) WKMG (Orlando, FL) WSLS (Roanoke, VA)

The parties with whom we may share personal information are:

* _Affiliates_. We may share information within GMG.
    
* _Business Partners_. We may also share information with business partners to provide you with the Services you request. For example, if you choose to enter a contest or sweepstakes that we are hosting with third parties, we may provide your information to those third parties. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these entities.
    
* _Service Providers_. We may share information with and receive information from companies providing services on our behalf, such as advertising service providers, website or database hosting companies, address list hosting companies, email service providers, analytics companies, distribution companies, fulfillment companies, payment processing companies, and other similar vendors and services providers. We will not authorize these third parties to use your personal information except as necessary to provide services to us or for purposes authorized by us. [Hearken](https://wearehearken.com/) is a third-party service provider.
    
* _Social Media Sites and Other Similar Platforms_. When you direct us to share your personal information with or link the Services to third-party sites or platforms, such as social media sites, we will comply with that request. Please note that once we share your personal information with another company in this circumstance, the information received by the other company is controlled by that company and becomes subject to their privacy practices.
    
* _Information Posted to Public Forums_. The Services may make chat rooms, forums, message boards, news groups, and/or other similar features available to users. Please remember that any information disclosed in these areas becomes public information. You should exercise caution when disclosing personal information about you or anyone else in such a forum. GMG does not accept responsibility for ensuring the privacy of any information you choose to disclose in these areas. Any content or information you provide to these areas of the Services is done at your own risk.
    
* _Other Parties When Required or Permitted by Law, or As Necessary to Protect Our Users and Services_. We may use and share your personal information as we believe necessary or appropriate to protect the legal rights, privacy, safety, or property of GMG, our employees, or users, to detect, suppress or prevent fraud, or where otherwise required or permitted by law or legal process, including responding to requests from public authorities.
    
* _Other Parties in Connection With a Corporate Transaction_. We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you if we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets to a third party, such as in the event of a merger, acquisition, or in connection with a bankruptcy reorganization.
    

We may use information, including personal information, we have collected about you to create de-identified and/or aggregated data sets, such as de-identified demographic information, aggregated trends, reports, or statistics about how users interact with the Services. De-identified and aggregated information is used for various functions, including measuring visitors’ interest in and use of various portions or features of the Services we offer. Such de-identified and aggregated information does not identify you individually and is, therefore, not personal information for purposes of this Privacy Policy. We may disclose such de-identified or aggregated information in several ways, including to improve the Services, for our internal business purposes, and any other legally permissible purpose.

#### How We Protect Your Information

We take the security of your personal information seriously. We implement commercially reasonable technical, physical, and administrative security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction of personal information collected through the Services.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. We cannot and do not guarantee that your personal information will never be accessed by an unauthorized party or otherwise breached during transmission through the Internet. Additionally, any contact with us by email or through the Services might not be secure. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for the circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on our websites.

If we believe the information you provided to us has been exposed to unauthorized third parties, we will notify you as required by law or upon our own choice. In the event of such unauthorized exposure, we expressly reserve the right to provide notice to you electronically via any email address you have provided if permitted by law. If you have reason to believe that your personal information, including any password you created for access to the Services, is no longer secure, please notify us immediately by contacting us via one of the methods listed below.

If you submit the request through an authorized agent, we may need to collect additional information to verify your identify before processing your request. If you are using an authorized agent to exercise your rights, we may deny a request if the authorized agent does not submit proof that they have been validly authorized to act on your behalf.

**_Authorized Agents_**.

You may designate an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf. We will require verification that you did in fact give that person your authorization. Unless the law requires otherwise, your authorized agent must provide contact details for you. We will contact you to confirm that you authorized the agent to act on your behalf. Once you confirm, we will promptly respond to the rights request. Please note, we will not share information about a business customer with anyone not clearly affiliated with that business.

**_Response Timing_**

Upon receiving your request, we will attempt to respond within 45 days. The response period may be extended when reasonably necessary. We will inform you of any such extension within 45 days of receiving your request, together with the reason for the extension.

**_Right to Appeal_**

If we decline to take action regarding your request, we will inform you of our decision and reasoning behind it. If you wish to appeal our decision, please e-mail us at:

Select Your Station - Website Policy Email KPRC (Houston, TX) KSAT (San Antonio, TX) WDIV (Detroit, MI) WJXT / WCWJ (Jacksonville, FL) WKMG (Orlando, FL) WSLS (Roanoke, VA) Graham Media Group (Detroit, MI)

Within 60 days of receipt of an appeal, we will inform you in writing of any action taken or not taken in response to the appeal, including a written explanation of the reason(s) for the decision. If your appeal is denied, you may contact your state’s Attorney General to submit a complaint related to the denial.

#### Additional Privacy Choices

In addition to the rights discussed above, there are various other ways to access, update, or limit the personal information you provide to us.

* _Additional Choices With Respect to Targeted Advertising_. As described above, we may allow third parties to compile information or aggregate statistics from our use of tracking pixels, cookies, and other tracking technologies to help them assess the effectiveness of online marketing and enable our advertisers and us to deliver targeted advertising. This allows users to see advertising more likely to be of interest to them and advertisers to send their messages to people who are most likely to be receptive, improving both the viewer’s experience and the effectiveness of the ads. You can learn more about specific types of targeted advertising by visiting the [Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.aboutads.info/) or our [Ad Choices page](https://youradchoices.com/control). In addition to disabling cookies and other tracking technologies described above, you may opt out of receiving targeted advertising from participating ad networks, audience segment providers, ad-serving vendors, and other service providers by visiting websites operated by the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1) and [Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.aboutads.info/). Please also note that many of our websites also feature built-in cookie preference menus.
    

* _Global Privacy Control_. Some browsers feature a universal global privacy control (GPC) setting. You may choose to enable GPC where available. We will process a readable GPC signal as an opt-out request for targeted advertising.
    
* _Google® Analytics_. Among other technologies, the services use Google Analytics, a service provided by Google, Inc. Google Analytics uses cookies to analyze how visitors interact with the Services. [Google Analytics’s policy](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/terms/us/) describes how it collects and processes data. You can opt out of Google Analytics collection and use of data generated using the Services by going to [http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).
    
* _Nielsen TV Ratings_. Our properties may feature Nielsen proprietary measurement software, allowing you to contribute to market research, such as Nielsen TV Ratings. To learn more about the information that Nielsen software may collect and your choices, please see the [Nielsen Digital Measurement Privacy Policy](http://www.nielsen.com/digitalprivacy).
    
* _Unsubscribe from Emails_. If you have registered to receive email updates or newsletters from us, you may opt out of receiving those communications by following the “unsubscribe” instructions included in the message.
    
* _Mobile Application Users_. Due to differences between using apps and websites on mobile devices, you may need to take additional steps to disable tracking technologies in mobile apps. Many mobile devices allow you to opt out of targeted advertising for mobile apps using the settings within the mobile app or your mobile device. For more information, please check your mobile settings. You also may uninstall our apps using the standard uninstall process available on your mobile device or app marketplace.
    
* _Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms._ Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites with which the user communicates. Because there currently is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, the Services currently do not act in response to these signals.
