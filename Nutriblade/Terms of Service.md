**Any dispute relating in any way to these use of the this Site, to these Terms and Conditions of Use, to the Privacy Policy, to our advertising or solicitation practices or to the products or servies that you purchase through the this Site, shall be resolved by mandatory arbitration before a single impartial arbitrator pursuant to proceedings administered by the American Arbitration Association under its rules for resolution of commercial disputes, except that, to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights, we may seek injunctive or other appropriate relief in any state or federal court in the State of New York, and you consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in such courts. Arbitration shall be conducted under the rules then prevailing of the American Arbitration Association for consumer disputes. The arbitration shall take place in New York, New York before a single arbitrator. The arbitrator's award shall be binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. YOU AND EMSON AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding, whether through class arbitration proceedings or otherwise. The arbitrator shall have no power to add to, subtract from, disregard, alter or modify any of the terms of the Terms and Conditions or the Privacy Policy. Any claim or controversy as to the enforceability of this arbitration provision’s restriction on your right to participate in or pursue a class action or class wide arbitration shall be brought only in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York or any court of the State of New York located in New York County, New York. You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you are waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action or representative action. This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.

**WAIVER**  
The failure of either party to require performance by the other party of any provision of this agreement shall not affect in any way the first party's right to require such performance at any time thereafter. Any waiver by either party of a breach of any provision in this agreement shall not be taken or held by the other party to be a continuing waiver of that provision unless such waiver is made in writing.
