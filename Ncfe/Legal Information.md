1. **How we collect personal information about you:**

When you give it to usÂ **directly,**Â for example, personal information that you give to us when you communicate with us by email, phone, or letter.

When we obtain itÂ **indirectly,**Â for example, your personal information will be shared with us by training/learning providers after you enrol for a course in relation to which we provide the relevant qualification.

When it isÂ **available publicly.**Â Your personal information may be available to us from external publicly available sources. For example, depending on your privacy settings for social media services, we may access information from those accounts or services.

When you visit ourÂ **website,**Â we automatically collect the following types of personal information:

(a) Technical information, including the internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your device to the internet, browser type and version, time zone setting, browser plug-in types and versions and operating systems and platforms.

(b) Information about your visit to the websites, including the uniform resource locator (URL) clickstream to, through and from the website (including date and time), services you viewed or searched for, page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, referral sources, page interaction information (such as scrolling and clicks) and methods used to browse away from the page.

We collect and use your personal information by using cookies on our website â€“ please see our Cookie Notice below.

When you visit ourÂ **premises**, for example, where CCTV is used on our premises.

In general, we may combine your personal information from these different sources set out above, for the purposes set out in this Notice.

2. **What personal information do we use?**

We may collect, store and otherwise process the following kinds of personal information:

1\. your name and contact details including postal address, telephone number, email address and emergency contact details and, where applicable;

2\. your date of birth and gender;

3\. your financial information, such as bank details and/ or credit/ debit card details;

4\. information about your computer/ mobile device and your visits to and use of this website, including, for example, your IP address and geographical location;

5\. unique candidate identifiers/unique learner numbers;

6\. details of your qualifications/ experience;

7\. details of courses you have attended or delivered;

8\. details of sickness or absence;

and/ or any other personal information which we obtain as per paragraph 1.

**Do we process special categories of data?**

The UK General Data Protection Regulation ("UK GDPR") recognises certain categories of personal information as sensitive and therefore requiring more protection, for example information about your health, ethnicity and religious beliefs.

In certain situations, NCFE may collect and/or use these special categories of data (for example, information on learnersâ€™ medical conditions so that we can make arrangements for reasonable adjustments and/or special considerations). We will only process special category data where we have an Article 9 exception allowing us to do so.

3. **How and why will we use your personal information?**

Your personal information, however provided to us, will be used for the purposes specified in this Notice. In particular, we may use your personal information:

1\. to register you as a learner and allow you to sit examinations;

2\. for examination administration purposes;

3\. to conduct examinations and assessments;

4\. to issue examination results and certificates;

5\. to carry out any reviews or appeals;

6\. to otherwise provide you with services, products or information you have requested;

7\. to communicate as necessary with training/learning providers;

8\. to provide further information about our work, services or activities (where necessary, only where you have provided your consent to receive such information);

9\. to answer your questions/ requests and communicate with you in general;

10\. to contact you to offer you future work opportunities in line with our annual contracting procedures covering, for example, flexible workers; individual â€“ sole traders (â€˜independent contractorsâ€™);

11\. to manage relationships with our partners and service providers;

12\. to analyse and improve our work, services, activities, products or information (including our website), or for our internal records;

13\. to keep our facilities safe and secure;

14\. to run/administer the activities of NCFE, including our website, and ensure that content is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your device;

15\. to audit and/or administer our accounts;

16\. to satisfy legal obligations which are binding on us, for example in relation to regulatory, government and/or law enforcement bodies with whom we may work (for example requirements relating to the payment of tax or anti-money laundering);

17\. for the prevention of fraud or misuse of services;

18\. for the establishment, defence and/ or enforcement of legal claims; and/or

19\. to notify you about changes to our services;

20\. to communicate with you for example, respond to queries and requests

4\. **Lawful bases**

The UK GDPR requires us to rely on one or more lawful bases to use your personal information. We consider the grounds listed below to be relevant:

1\. Where necessary so that we can **comply with a legal obligation**Â to which we are subject (for example, where we are obliged to share your personal information with regulatory bodies which govern our work and services).

2\. WhereÂ **necessary for the performance of a contract**Â to which you are a party or to take steps at your request prior to entering a contract (for example, to provide you with a certified award after sitting an examination).

3\. Where there is aÂ **legitimate interest**Â in us doing so.

4\. Where the above reasons have not been satisfied and / or you have provided yourÂ **consent**Â for us to use your personal information in a certain way.

The UK GDPR allows us to collect and process your personal information if it is reasonably necessary to achieve our or othersâ€™ legitimate interests (as long as that processing is fair, balanced and does not unduly impact your rights as an individual).

In broad terms, our "legitimate interests" means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience

When we process your personal information to achieve such legitimate interests, we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative), and on your rights under data protection laws. We will not use your personal information for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you, for example where use would be excessively intrusive (unless, for instance, we are otherwise required or permitted to by law).

5. **Supporter research**

We may also analyse your personal information to create a record of your interests and preferences. This allows us to ensure communications are relevant and timely, to contact you in the most appropriate and relevant way and in general to provide you with an improved user experience. It also helps us to understand the background of our supporters so that we can make appropriate requests to those who may be willing and able to give more than they already do, enabling us to raise funds and help beneficiaries sooner and more cost-effectively.Â **If you would prefer us not to use your personal information for supporter research please let us know by using the contact details below.**

6. **Communications for marketing/promotional purposes**

We may use your contact details to provide you with information about our work, events, services and/or activities which we consider may be of interest to you (for example, about other certified awards we offer or training/learning providers we work with).

Where we do this via email, SMS or telephone (where you are registered with the Telephone Preference Service), we will not do so without your prior consent (unless allowed to do so via applicable law).

Where you have provided us with your consent previously but do not wish to be contacted by us about our work, events, services and/or activities in the future, please let us know by email at [\[emailÂ protected\]](https://www.ncfe.org.uk/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). You can opt out of receiving emails from NCFE at any time by clicking the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of our emails.

7. **Donations/payments**

When you use our secure online payment function you will be directed to a specialist payment services provider who will receive your financial information to process the transaction. We will not directly store your financial details as needed for these transactions. We will provide your personal information to the payment services provider only to the extent necessary for the purpose of processing your payment.

8. **Childrenâ€™s personal information**

When we process childrenâ€™s personal information, we will not do so without their consent where we require it or, where required, the consent of a parent/ guardian. We will always have in place appropriate safeguards to ensure that childrenâ€™s personal information is handled with due care.

9. **How long do we keep your personal information?**

In general, unless still required in connection with the purpose(s) for which it was collected and/or processed, we remove your personal information from our records six years after the date it was collected. However, if before that date (i) your personal information is no longer required in connection with such purpose(s), (ii) we are no longer lawfully entitled to process it or (iii) you validly exercise your right of erasure (please see Section 13 below), we will remove it from our records at the relevant time.

If you request to receive no further contact from us, we may keep some basic information about you on our suppression list in order to comply with your request and avoid sending you unwanted materials in the future.

10. **Will we share your personal information?**

We do not share, sell or rent your personal information to third parties for marketing purposes. However, in general we may disclose your personal information to selected third parties in order to achieve the purposes set out in this Notice.

These parties may include (but are not limited to):

1\. training/learning providers;

2\. individual examiners;

3\. educational authorities such as Department for Education, Welsh Government, Department of Education Northern Ireland, HESA, UCAS, ESFA and the Learning Records Service;

4\. local authorities and other public bodies responsible for education;

5\. other educational establishments/prospective employers (for example if a reference is sought);

6\. suppliers and sub-contractors for the performance of any contract we enter into with them, for example IT service providers such as website hosts or cloud storage providers;

7\. professional service providers such as accountants and lawyers;

8\. parties assisting us with research to monitor the impact/effectiveness of our work, events, services and activities;

9\. the police, for example in sharing data in relation to malpractice cases linked to fraud;

10\. regulatory bodies who govern our work, such as Ofqual, Qualifications Wales, CCEA Regulation, SQA or Ofsted; and/or

11\. other companies within NCFE group (i.e., subsidiary companies of NCFE);

In particular, we reserve the right to disclose your personal information to third parties:

* in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we will disclose your personal information to the (prospective) seller or buyer of such business or assets;
* if substantially all of our assets are acquired by a third party, personal information held by us may be one of the transferred assets;
* if we are under any legal or regulatory duty to do so; and/or
* to protect the rights, property or safety of NCFE, its personnel, users, visitors or others.

11. **Security/storage of and access to your personal information**

NCFE is committed to keeping your personal information safe and secure and we have appropriate and proportionate security policies and organisational and technical measures in place to help protect your information and handle any potential security breaches. We have in place a robust access control policy which limits access to your personal data to those employees, contractors, volunteers and other third parties who only have a business need to know. The processing of your personal data will only take place subject to NCFEâ€™S instruction.

Personal Data is stored on secure servers which have features to prevent your personal data from being accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed.

12. **International Data Transfers**

Given that we are a UK-based organisation we will normally only transfer your personal information within the European Economic Area ("**EEA**"), where all countries have the same level of data protection law as under the UK GDPR.

However, because we may sometimes use agencies and/or suppliers to process personal information on our behalf, it is possible that personal information we collect from you will be transferred to and stored in a location outside the EEA, for example the United States. For any transfers to the United States, NCFE follow the EU-US Data Privacy Framework and UK-US Data bridge.

Please note that some countries outside of the EEA have a lower standard of protection for personal information, including lower security requirements and fewer rights for individuals. Where your personal information is transferred, stored and/or otherwise processed outside the EEA in a country that does not offer an equivalent standard of protection to the EEA, we will take all reasonable steps necessary to ensure that the recipient implements appropriate safeguards which include:

* International Data Transfer Agreement
* EU Standard Contractual Clauses + UK Addendum
* An exception as defined in Article 49 of the EU GDPR

If you have any questions about the transfer of your personal information, please contact us using the details below.

Unfortunately, no transmission of your personal information over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Once we have received your personal information, we use strict procedures and security features to try and prevent unauthorised access.

13. **Exercising your Rights**

Where we rely on your consent to use your personal information, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. This includes the right to ask us to stop using your personal information for marketing or fundraising purposes or to unsubscribe from our email list at any time. You also have the following rights:

**1\. Right of access**Â â€“ you can write to us to ask for confirmation of what personal information we hold on you and to request a copy of that personal information without charge. Provided we are satisfied that you are entitled to see the personal information requested and we have successfully confirmed your identity, we will provide you with your personal information subject to any exemptions that apply.

**2\. Right of erasure** â€“ at your request we will delete your personal information from our records as far as we are required to do so. In many cases we would propose to suppress further communications with you, rather than delete it.

**3\. Right of rectification**Â â€“ if you believe our records of your personal information are inaccurate, you have the right to ask for those records to be updated. You can also ask us to check the personal information we hold about you if you are unsure whether it is accurate/up to date.

**4\. Right to restrict processing** â€“ you have the right to ask for processing of your personal information to be restricted if there is disagreement about its accuracy or legitimate usage. Or you have exercised your right to object to processing and require processing to be halted while a decision on the request to object is made. Or if you are exercising your right to rectification.

**5\. Right to object**Â â€“ you have the right to object to processing where we are (i) processing your personal information on the basis of our legitimate interests (see section 4 above), (ii) using your personal information for direct marketing or (iii) using your information for statistical purposes or (iv) Processing includes automated decision making and profiling

**6\. Right to data portability â€“**Â to the extent required by the UK GDPR, where we are processing your personal information (that you have provided to us) either (i) by relying on your consent or (ii) because such processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party or to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract, and in either case we are processing using automated means (i.e. with no human involvement), you may ask us to provide the personal information to you â€“ or another service provider â€“ in a machine-readable format. Where you have given consent for processing, or explicit consent in relation to the processing of special category data, you have the right to withdraw this consent at any time, but this will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.

**7\. Rights related to automated decision-making**Â â€“ you have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing of your personal information which produces legal or similarly significant effects on you, unless such a decision (i) is necessary to enter into/perform a contract between you and us/another organisation; (ii) is authorised by EU or Member State law to which NCFE is subject (as long as that law offers you sufficient protection); or (iii) is based on your explicit consent.

Please note that some of these rights only apply in limited circumstances. For more information, we suggest that you contact us using the details in section 16 below.

If you have any queries or concerns in relation to your personal data we hold or you wish to raise a subject access request, please contact us using the details provided in section 16 below. You are further entitled to make a complaint to the Information Commissionerâ€™s Office
