How we transfer and store your Personal Data

We operate globally and we may share some of your Personal Data, with organizations (including our affiliates and our service providers) who are outside of the jurisdiction in which the Personal Data was collected. Because we are headquartered in the United States, Personal Data collected in other countries is routinely transferred to the United States for processing. That is, Personal Data collected in one jurisdiction may be transferred, stored, and processed outside the country of origin. For these transfers, we have the relevant legal safeguards in place, including (for example) by way of contractual arrangements based on sets of standard contractual clauses that have been pre-approved by the European Commission (or otherwise consistent with the requirements of the relevant jurisdiction) to ensure adequate protection, or in certain circumstances we may rely on one of the exceptions to the rules that allows us to perform these transfers. This reflects our commitment to protecting your Personal Data regardless of where your Personal Data resides. Personal Data stored or processed in a foreign jurisdiction may be accessed under a lawful order made in that jurisdiction.

How we protect your Personal Data  

We are committed to protecting the security of your Personal Data. We use reasonable technical and organization measures, in compliance with applicable law, to protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage.

How long we retain your Personal Data

We will retain your Personal Data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected, such as providing our services, or as required by applicable laws or regulations. This period may extend beyond the termination of our relationship with you.
