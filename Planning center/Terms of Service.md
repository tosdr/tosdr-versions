_Last updated March 20, 2024_

This page outlines the Terms of Service under which Ministry Centered Technologies, Inc. (“we” or “us”) provides the use of our Planning Center software service, websites, and desktop and mobile applications (collectively referred to herein as “Planning Center”).

Please read this page carefully. By using Planning Center, “you” (whether you are a Customer, Organization Administrator, Authorized User or Individual, as described in further detail below) are indicating your acceptance to be bound by these Terms of Service. In other words, these Terms of Service are a binding contract between you and us. If you are unwilling to be bound to these Terms of Service, please do not use Planning Center.

By entering into these Terms of Service, you further acknowledge your understanding and acceptance of our [Privacy Policy.](https://www.planningcenter.com/privacy)

Please note that these Terms of Service are subject to change. We may, in our sole discretion, revise the Terms of Service at any time by updating this page. You should visit this page periodically to review the Terms of Service, as it is binding upon you.

**In addition, please be advised that this Agreement contains provisions that govern how disputes between us are resolved, including arbitration, a jury trial waiver and a class action waiver.**

2\. Customers, Organization Administrators, Authorized Users, and Individuals
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Planning Center supports four categories of users: Customers, Organization Administrators, Authorized Users and Individuals. Each type of user has different permissions and responsibilities, which are more fully defined below. For ease of reference, we will use the term “you” in these Terms of Service to refer to the user of Planning Center (whether they be a Customer, Organization Administrator, Authorized User, or Individual).

1. ### Customers
    
    The organization (e.g., the Church) is our customer (the “Customer”). An individual who has the full authority to enter into binding contracts and conduct business on behalf of the Customer (the “Initial User”) must be the person who creates the Planning Center account on Customer's behalf (the “Account”). We may require the Initial User to provide proof of authority to enter into contracts on behalf of the Customer, and we reserve the right to suspend the Customer's access to Planning Center until such proof is provided. However, we specifically disclaim all liability for an Account that was opened by an individual who had no authority to do so on Customer's behalf.
    
    By creating an Account, Customer represents and warrants that the Initial User has full authority to create the Account; that all registration information that the Initial User submits is truthful and accurate; and that Customer will maintain the accuracy of such information. If any of the Account information changes, the Account must be immediately updated with the current information. Information related to the Account can be changed or updated by going to the “Settings” area of Planning Center and modifying the pertinent information. You can also contact us with questions on how to update or change your information by email at [support@planningcenter.com](mailto:support@planningcenter.com).
    
2. ### Organization Administrators
    
    Upon the creation of the Account, the Initial User is automatically deemed an Organization Administrator of the Account. The Initial User may delegate additional administrators who have full access to manage the Account and use Planning Center (collectively, the “Organization Administrators”). The Organization Administrators must also have full authority to enter into binding contracts and conduct business on behalf of Customer. We may require the Organization Administrators to provide proof that they have the authority to enter into contracts on behalf of the Customer. However, we specifically disclaim all liability for the actions of Organization Administrators who had no authority to act on Customer's behalf.
    
    Organization Administrators may be added or deleted by another Organization Administrator. In the event an Organization Administrator is deleted, the Organization Administrator shall cease to have access to Planning Center and any information within Planning Center. In addition, an Organization Administrator, acting on behalf of the Customer, may delete the Account and therefore all data and information related to the Account in Planning Center. Organization Administrators, acting on behalf of the Customer, may also rename the Account or sign up for additional features of Planning Center. However, Organization Administrator's shall not take any action or inaction that is disparaging to the Customer or contrary to the Customer's mission or instructions. We are not liable for the conduct of a Customer or Organization Administrator, including, without limitation, deletion of data, improper use of data, inappropriate information posted, violation of laws related to privacy, or any other conduct by a Customer or Organization Administrator.
    
    In the event of a conflict among Organization Administrators or between Organization Administrators and the Customer, the Customer must resolve the issue and provide us with written instructions on how to proceed that are signed by the Chief Executive or President of the organization. We will proceed based on those instructions. In the event of a conflict over the identity of the Chief Executive or President, we will act in accordance to a court order that names the Chief Executive or President. If a dispute requires us to engage counsel, the Customer agrees to pay our fees and costs. We may suspend the Planning Center account until said conflict is resolved.
    
3. ### Authorized Users
    
    “Authorized Users” are users who are granted permission to access Planning Center by either (i) an Organization Administrator, or (ii) another Authorized User that has been given the permissions to add additional Authorized Users by an Organizational Administrator. However, Authorized Users will not have access to the same administrative features as Organization Administrators. Authorized Users acknowledge and agree that an Organization Administrator or another Authorized User may (a) remove their access to Planning Center; (b) delete or change any information that such user has entered into Planning Center; or (c) delete the entire Account, which would result in the deletion of all data from Authorized Users.
    
    Authorized Users shall not take any action or inaction that: interferes with the Customer's ability to use Planning Center, is disparaging to the Customer, or is contrary to the Customer's mission and/or instructions.
    
4. ### Individuals
    
    “Individuals” are single users who have a connection with the Customer (e.g., a member of the congregation). Individuals can sign up to use and access certain features of Planning Center such as event registration and donations. To be clear, Individuals do not have full access to all features of Planning Center, and Individuals' accounts are linked to the corresponding Customer. This means that the Customer, Organizational Administrators and/or Authorized Users can view information and data that Individuals have entered into Planning Center.
    
    Individuals acknowledge and agree that the Customer and its agents can view, access and use the information and data Individuals have entered into Planning Center. Individuals also acknowledge and agree that Organization Administrators or Authorized Users may (a) remove their access to Planning Center; (b) delete or change any information that such Individual has entered into Planning Center; or (c) delete the entire Account, which would result in the deletion of all data from Individuals.
    

3\. Responsibilities of Customers, Organization Administrators, Authorized Users, and Individuals
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. ### Responsibilities of the Customer
    
    The Customer shall ensure that Customer and all Organization Administrators, Authorized Users and Individuals comply with these Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy. The Customer further represents and warrants that it is responsible for itself as well as the conduct of Organization Administrators, Authorized Users and Individuals. The Customer agrees to hold us harmless for the conduct of Customer, the Organization Administrators, the Authorized Users and the Individuals per Section 13 (indemnification). The Customer shall cooperate with us in ensuring that they, Organization Administrators, Authorized Users and Individuals comply with these Terms of Service.
    
    Some of the features of Planning Center allow the Customer, Organization Administrators, Authorized Users or Individuals to enter data into Planning Center (“Customer Data”). Customer Data may include or incorporate information related to third-party individuals – for example, the names and addresses of the Customer's members, and any donations from said members (“Third-Party Information”). The Customer represents and warrants that it has the rights, basis, and permissions to enter the Customer Data and Third-Party Information into Planning Center. Customer further understands and agrees that it shall bear all responsibility for the Customer Data and Third-Party Information, and Customer shall resolve all disputes involving the Third-Party Information.
    
    In the event that we are contacted by a person who has a dispute related to the Customer Data or Third-Party Information, we will notify Customer within 45 days. We have the right to suspend or terminate the Planning Center account until the Customer and said person resolve their dispute. The Customer represents and warrants that it will hold us harmless from all claims and/or disputes related to the Customer Data and Third-Party Information, as more fully described in Section 13 (indemnification).
    
    To be clear, Customer is responsible for complying with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, and represents and warrants that it and its Organization Administrators, Authorized Users and Individuals will not use Planning Center in a manner that violates the laws, rules and regulations in the applicable jurisdiction.
    
2. ### Responsibilities of the Organization Administrator
    
    Organization Administrators shall follow the instructions of the Customer, and shall comply with the Customer's policies and practices that are relevant to the use of Planning Center. Organization Administrators shall also provide us with all necessary rights, permissions and/or consents necessary to grant us the rights and licenses in these Terms of Service, and all rights, permissions and/or consents necessary for the lawful use and transmission of personal information and data that is required for the use and operation of Planning Center.
    
    Furthermore, Organization Administrators shall (a) ensure that Authorized Users and Individuals understand and comply with all Customer policies and practices that are relevant to their use of Planning Center; (b) ensure that the Authorized Users and Individuals understand and comply with these Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy; (c) obtain all rights, permissions and/or consents from Authorized Users and Individuals that are necessary to grant us the rights and licenses in these Terms of Service; and (d) obtain all rights, permissions and/or consents from Authorized Users and Individuals for the lawful use and transmission of their personal information and data that is required for their use and operation of Planning Center. Organization Administrators shall cooperate with us in ensuring that they, the Customer, Authorized Users and Individuals comply with these Terms of Service.
    
3. ### Responsibilities of Authorized Users and Individuals
    
    Authorized Users and Individuals shall follow the instruction of Organization Administrators and the Customer. Authorized Users and Individuals shall: (a) comply with all Customer policies and practices that are relevant to the use of Planning Center; (b) comply with these Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy; (c) provide the Customer and/or Organization Administrators with all rights, permissions and/or consents that are necessary to grant us the rights and licenses in these Terms of Service; and (d) provide all permissions and/or consents to the Customer and/or Organization Administrators for the lawful use and transmission of their personal information and data that is required for the use and operation of Planning Center.

You agree to notify us immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account. You acknowledge and agree that we will not be liable for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your username and password. You shall keep your account password secure, and take appropriate measures to safeguard the security of your username, password and electronic device(s).
    
    In addition, all users of Planning Center are responsible for providing their legal full name, a valid email address or mobile phone number, and any other information requested in order to complete the signup process. If any of this information changes, the information must be immediately updated with the current information. Information can be changed or updated by going to the “Profile” area of Planning Center and modifying the pertinent information. All users can also contact us with questions on how to update or change their information by email at [support@planningcenter.com](mailto:support@planningcenter.com).
    
    Finally, all users of Planning Center shall be responsible for complying with these Terms of Service, and further understand and agree that they are responsible for all information, data and content that they enter into Planning Center, and all activity that occurs using Planning Center.

6\. Service Provider Status
---------------------------

We are a Service Provider, as defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798 et seq.), and receive personal information from you for the business purposes of providing Planning Center. We will not retain, use, or disclose your data, including personal information, for any purpose other than as we specify in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.planningcenter.com/privacy). Please review our Privacy Policy for information on how we use the data we collect and/or process. You can request to add a Data Processing Addendum (DPA) to any existing service agreement with us [here](https://pcoprivacy.churchcenter.com/people/forms/333096).

7\. Monitoring, Security, and Third-Party Payment Processing
------------------------------------------------------------

### Monitoring

We have no obligation to monitor Planning Center or your use of Planning Center. You acknowledge and agree that we have the right to monitor Planning Center electronically from time to time and to disclose any information that we deem necessary to satisfy any law, regulation or other governmental request, to operate Planning Center properly, or to protect itself or its users, affiliates, partners and contracted parties, as discussed in further detail in our Privacy Policy.

### Security

While we take the security of Planning Center very seriously, we cannot ensure or guarantee the security of Planning Center. Any such use shall be at your sole risk, and you shall relieve Ministry Centered Technologies and our affiliates of all liability in connection therewith.

### Third-Party Payment Processing

We use a third-party to process payments related to Planning Center, which is currently Stripe. Therefore, you may be asked by the third-party payment processor to supply certain information, including credit card or other payment mechanisms. You agree that all information you provide any third-party payment processor through Planning Center will be accurate and complete. You agree to pay all charges incurred by you at the prices in effect when such charges are incurred. We are in no way responsible for any charges you or (if you are a Customer) any Organization Administrator, Authorized User or Individual incurs when making purchases or other transactions. We may retain sufficient personal information from your purchase to report to the IRS or other government authority, and retain such information for at least the minimum statutory period. Customers specifically acknowledge and agree that they are responsible for the use of data related to tracking donations through Planning Center. You acknowledge and agree that your use of Stripe is governed by Stripe's terms of use, available at [https://stripe.com/legal/ssa](https://stripe.com/legal/ssa), and you further agree Planning Center is neither responsible nor liable for disputes arising out of or relating to your use of Stripe.

8\. Payment, Refunds, Upgrading, And Downgrading Terms
------------------------------------------------------

### How we bill for Planning Center

If you sign up for a paid account, you have the option of paying by check or by credit card in the following manner:

If you elect to pay via check, we will send you an invoice 30 days before payment is due. You have the option to choose to pay for your account every three (3), six (6) or twelve (12) months.

If you elect to pay via credit card and you (i) initially sign up for a paid account, and (ii) do not cancel that account within 30 days, your card will be **_automatically_** charged starting on the 30th day after your account was initially created. We will continue to charge your credit card each month on the same day of the month that your credit card was first charged _until you cancel your account with Planning Center_. For example, if you signed up for a paid account on April 1, your credit card will be charged on May 1 (30 days later), and will be charged on the 1st of the month every month thereafter until you cancel the Services. If you cancel prior to the processing of your first invoice prior to the 30th day, you will not be charged. See Section 8, below, for how to cancel Planning Center.

To be clear, if you sign up for a paid account and (i) choose to pay via credit card and (ii) do not cancel at the end of 30 days, **YOUR CREDIT CARD WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY CHARGED THE AMOUNT OF THE PAID ACCOUNT PLAN AND YOUR PAID ACCOUNT PLAN WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY EXTENDED FOR SUCCESSIVE PERIODS OF ONE MONTH. AS SUCH, YOUR PAYMENT METHOD WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY CHARGED AT THE THEN-CURRENT RATE ON THE SAME DAY OF THE MONTH, EACH MONTH, UNTIL YOU CANCEL YOUR PLANNING CENTER ACCOUNT.** For current pricing, you can contact us or visit [https://planningcenter.com](https://planningcenter.com/).

### How we charge for paid plans

Payments for paid account plans are processed through Stripe. You agree to pay the the amount charged for the paid account plan that you selected. You are also responsible for paying any sales and use taxes that may apply to your purchase of the paid account. If you do not pay on time or if your payment method cannot be charged for any reason, we reserve the right to either suspend or terminate your access to Planning Center. We will not be responsible for any costs, expenses, or liabilities arising out of or related to the cancellation of your Services for this reason. Our third-party payment service provider (Stripe) may receive updated payment/banking information from your credit card or payment method issuer. The disbursement of this updated information is provided at the election of your credit card and payment method issuer. Neither we nor our third-party payment service provider is responsible for the distribution of your credit card or payment method information. It is at the sole election of your credit card or payment method issuer. Your credit card or payment method issuer may give you the right to opt out of the update service. It is your responsibility to contact your credit card or payment method issuer with regards to your right to opt out of the update service.

### Account upgrades

When you upgrade your subscription level, the new features will be available to you immediately upon upgrade and the new charges will appear on your next billing cycle unless a 30-day free trial is available for those particular new features. If you sign up for a free trial, we will send you an email ten (10) days before the free trial ends reminding you that (a) the free trial is concluding in ten days, and (b) new charges will appear on the billing cycle after the 30-day free trial is finished. Please note when you upgrade from the free account to a paid account you will be billed and charged for your first month _immediately_ upon upgrading and each month after that in accordance with the above section (How we bill for Planning Center).

### Planning Center is non-refundable

Planning Center billed in advance on a monthly basis and is **non-refundable.** There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for unused months of Planning Center. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

### Taxes

We collect sales tax when we are obligated to do so, as determined by our tax advisor and applicable law. Sales tax is non-refundable. If you have a valid Tax Exemption Certificate, then we will abide by the law regarding charging you sales tax provided that you provide us with your valid Tax Exemption Certificate for our records. We will retain your Tax Exemption Certificate, as well all tax records related to you, even after you are fully deleted from our system in all other respects.

### Billing for upgrades and downgrades

For any upgrade or downgrade in plan level, the credit card that you provided will automatically be charged the new rate on your next billing cycle. Downgrading your Services may cause the loss of content, information, features, or capacity of your Account. We shall not be liable for any such loss.

### Expired credit cards

In the event your credit card expires or cannot be charged, we must suspend Planning Center until you remit payment. You have 30 days to remit payment to us before we terminate your Account and your access to Planning Center pursuant to our termination provision below. We will not be responsible for any costs, expenses, or liabilities arising out of or related to the termination of your Account.

9\. Cancellation and Termination
--------------------------------

### Cancelling your Account

Customer is solely responsible for properly cancelling the Account. An email or phone request to cancel your Account is not considered cancellation. To cancel the Account, an Organization Administrator must click on the “Accounts” link in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Accounts screen provides a simple no-questions-asked cancellation link for each application. If you have questions regarding cancelling an Account, we are happy to help. Just email us at [support@planningcenter.com](mailto:support@planningcenter.com) or give us a call at (866) 726-2730. However, please be aware that you will no longer have access to Planning Center and all Customer Data will be deleted after one year from the date of cancellation, and in accordance with our Privacy Policy. Customer Data that is deleted is NOT recoverable. Thus, we require that the Organization Administrator who is cancelling the Account on behalf of the Customer have the Customer's full authorization and consent.

We, in our sole discretion, have the right to suspend or terminate your Account and refuse any and all current or future use of Planning Center for any reason at any time, including a violation of these Terms of Service. In addition, in the event you fail to remit payment for Planning Center, we shall suspend your account and, after 30 days, terminate your Account. In the event we terminate your Account, the termination will result in (i) the deactivation or deletion of your Account, and (ii) the forfeiture and relinquishment of all Customer Data after one year from the date of termination has passed. After termination, you will no longer have access to Planning Center.

**Credits and Billing for Text Messaging Services**

For Planning Center text messaging services, Customers can purchase prepaid credit packages for the then-current rates, which can be viewed on [https://accounts.planningcenteronline.com/products](https://accounts.planningcenteronline.com/products). These credits can be used for sending messages, typically at an exchange of 1 credit for 1 message segment (this may differ in the case of international texts, MMS, or other rate exceptions, which will be made clear at the time of sending). There is no recurring billing or subscription for these purchases.

Credits for text messaging services may only be used by the purchaser of the credit. The credit packages cannot be transferred, sold, or gifted to other Customers. Credits will expire twelve months from the purchase date.

Standard message and data rates may apply for any messages sent to or from the subscribers. Message frequency varies. Carriers are not liable for delayed or undelivered messages.

### “Text2Give” (84321) in Planning Center Giving

Text2Give is a feature of Planning Center Giving. This system allows Individual subscribers (i.e., donors) a way to initiate one-time donations to the Customer (i.e., their church) by sending a text message to 84321. Example: “$15” After each donation the Text2Give subscriber receives a confirmation reply.

Payment methods and contact data are always managed on the subscriber’s web-portal at churchcenter.com – never via the text messages themselves.

Text2Give subscriber data is never shared or with third parties or used for marketing.

Standard message and data rates may apply for any messages sent to or from the subscribers. Message frequency varies as messages are sent in response to incoming messages from the Subscriber. Carriers are not liable for delayed or undelivered messages.

### No waiver and partial validity

The failure of Ministry Centered Technologies to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. The Terms of Service constitutes the entire agreement between you and Ministry Centered Technologies and governs your use of Planning Center, superseding any prior agreements between you and Ministry Centered Technologies (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of the Terms of Service). If any provision of these Terms of Service is found to be invalid by any court having competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of the Terms of Service, which shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any term of the Terms of Service shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term.

### YouTube

Planning Center uses YouTube for some features. Use of these features is subject to [YouTube's terms of service](https://www.youtube.com/t/terms).

### Arbitration

Please read this Section carefully. It is part of your agreement with us, and it affects your rights. It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION.

You agree that any dispute related to this Agreement, your use of Planning Center, or any dispute related to your relationship with Ministry Centered Technologies, Inc. or our affiliates, directors, officers, agents, shareholders, members, subsidiaries, parents, shall be submitted to binding arbitration under the rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (JAMS), located in San Diego, California.

The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator, with the prevailing party to pay all costs and attorney fees. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

### Jury Trial Waiver

Please read this Section carefully. It is part of your agreement with us and affects your rights. It contains a WAIVER OF YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.

You hereby waive your constitutional and statutory rights to go to court and have a trial in front of a judge or a jury, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and Ministry Centered Technologies, Inc. in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.

If you do not send this notice, then you agree to be bound by the terms of the Arbitration, Jury Trial Waiver and Class Action Waiver Provisions in this Section. Agreeing to arbitration and waiving your rights to jury trial and class action participation is an important decision for you to make. It can shorten the litigation process and result in cost savings, but it also takes away certain rights, such as the right to a trial in front of your peers. Thus, please take time to carefully consider the Arbitration, Jury Trial Waiver and Class Action Waiver Provisions of this Agreement. Since the information provided in this Agreement is not intended to contain a complete explanation of the consequences of arbitration, class action or jury waiver, you may want to consult an attorney.
