Who we are

We are Highsoft AS. Our address is Sentrumsgata 44, 6893 Vik i Sogn, Norway.

You can contact us by postal mail at the above address, or by email at privacy@highsoft.com.

You can read more about us here.



In collecting information about you, we are acting as a data controller and we are required to

provide you with information about why and how we collect and use your data, and about the

rights you have over your data.



We are not required to have a data protection officer. Any inquiries about our use of your

personal data should be addressed to the contact details above.



Introduction

Highsoft is committed to protecting your privacy and will make every commercially viable

measure to secure your data according to European Union’s General Data Protection

Regulation (GDPR) guidelines. Any and all information collected is safeguarded according to

the applicable legislation concerning personal data and is updated to comply with the GDPR.

This privacy policy outlines the information, including any personal data we collect when you

use and interact with our website and services.



How we collect your information

In the course of providing content, products, and services to our visitors and customers, we

collect or receive information about you in different ways.

You provide some data directly, and some data we get by collecting data about your

interactions, usages, and experiences with our website, products, and services. When collecting

your data we will give you the chance to choose what information to provide for e.g. enabling us

to market and promote products or services.

We collect and process personal data about you only where we have a legal basis for doing so

under applicable European Union (EU) laws, even if you are located outside the European

Economic Area (EEA).



Why we collect your information

We collect information in order to be able to understand, analyze and improve our website and

services. In some cases, we may require certain information in order to provide certain products

and services and to ensure our services and offerings are performing optimally and to protect

our, and your legal rights and interests.



Version 8.5 Page 4 of 17

Privacy Policy



Information storage and security

We rely on third-party partners to collect data about you and your use of our website and

services as well as for some of the features and functionality. We have Data Processing

Agreements (DPA) with all third-party data processors that commits them to provide an

appropriate level of safeguards for your personal data, which includes compliance with GDPR.



Most of our data is collected and processed within the EEA. For processing that is taking place

outside EEA, we have provided appropriate safeguards to ensure our partners accept the EU

Standard Contractual Clauses (SCC) for International Data Transfers.



3rd party Systems and Processors

We have DPAs with all our Processors, and they all adhere to the Payment Card Industry Data

Security Standard (PCI DSS) for Service Providers.



Below you will find more information about how we collect and process information, including

how we use third-party partners in connection with our services.



When you use our website

Our legal basis for collecting the information described in this section is based on legitimate

interest, in reference to Article 6-1(f) of the GDPR, or consent in reference to Article 6-1(a) of the

GDPR.

This section details the information we collect from you when you use our website to browse our

products and services and view the content we make available.



Cookies

Cookies are small pieces of text sent by a website and stored on your computer by your web

browser. A cookie file is stored in your web browser and allows the service or a third-party to

recognize you and make your next visit easier and the service more useful to you.



Please refer to our Cookie Policy for detailed information on which cookies we set when visiting

our website and using our services, including what purpose each serves.



We use JSFiddle to display code demos and samples on our webpages and on our blog.

JSFiddle does not track personal data but sets a session cookie to prevent cross-domain

attacks in the embedded code samples. Please refer to JSFiddle - Terms \& Conditions and

JSFiddle - Privacy Policy for additional information.



Version 8.5 Page 5 of 17

Privacy Policy



We use website analytics services called Google Analytics, Google Ads, and Google Tag

Manager to record usage and performance data of our website and web-services. We will also

use a marketing automation tool to gather certain website data related to campaigns.



We analyze aggregated anonymized data based on e.g. the date you visit the site, how often

you come to this site, what pages you visit when you do so, and what other sites you used prior

to coming to this site, observing trends, visitor numbers and behavior. We have ensured that the

data we collect through website analytics services are anonymized in such a manner that it can

not be used to re-identify you by e.g. excluding IP addresses or your detailed location. If you

consent to us using Statistics cookies in our consent manager, we additionally use Google

Analytics built-in demographic, and extended ecommerce tracking to the same end. This

tracking provides aggregated data on Age, Gender, Affinity Categories, In-Market segments,

and other categories, along with Purchasing Information (Product, Quantity) from our web-shop

in the event a purchase is made. Demographics data is collected by Google and its Affiliates,

and shared with Highsoft in an aggregated form. Google and its Affiliates may use collected

data for targeted advertising. Further details on how Google collects, processes, and stores this

data can be found here. The use of Statistics cookies requires that you give your consent in our

cookie declaration. You may also prevent data from being used by Google Analytics by

installing the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.



Web beacons

Pages on our site and emails we send to our users may contain web beacons. Web beacons

(also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs) are small electronic file references

that are embedded onto a web page or an email to analyze traffic, for example, whether a user

has successfully opened an email, visited a page or completed a purchase.

In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, web beacons are

rendered invisibly on web pages when you open a page.



UTM codes

We may also make use of UTM codes. These are strings that are appended to a URL (the

“Uniform Resource Locator,” which is typically the HTTP or HTTPS address entered to go to a

web page) when a user moves from one web page or website to another, where the string can

represent information about browsing, such as which promotion, page, or publisher sent the

user to the receiving website.



UTM codes are used to enhance our web analytics solutions to understand, for example, if the

visitor’s journey on our site started with a newsletter or ad campaign. Any analytics gathered on

the basis of UTM codes are, and will remain, anonymous and analyzed in aggregate form.



Version 8.5 Page 6 of 17

Privacy Policy



Google reCAPTCHA

In the prevention of spam and abuse, we use the reCAPTCHA feature of Google on our

website. This function is primarily used to distinguish whether an input is made by a natural

person or abusive by automated processing. The service includes the sending of the IP address

and possibly other data required by Google for the reCAPTCHA service to Google. Additional

information about Google reCAPTCHA and Google's privacy policy can be found here.



Hotjar user behavior tracking

When consenting to Statistics cookies in our consent manager, we use Hotjar in order to better

understand our users’ needs and to optimize this service and experience. Hotjar is a technology

service that helps us better understand our users’ experience (e.g. how much time they spend

on which pages, which links they choose to click, what users do and don’t like, etc.) and this

enables us to build and maintain our service with user feedback. Hotjar uses cookies and other

technologies to collect data on our users’ behavior and their devices. This includes a device's IP

address (processed during your session and stored in a de-identified form), device screen size,

device type (unique device identifiers), browser information, geographic location (country only),

and the preferred language used to display our website. Hotjar stores this information on our

behalf in a pseudonymized user profile. Hotjar is contractually forbidden to sell any of the data

collected on our behalf.



For further details, please see the ‘about Hotjar’ section of Hotjar’s support site.



Why do we collect this information?

Some tracking mechanisms are considered necessary and are required in order to provide

certain functionality like navigation and search. Other tracking mechanisms are essential for us

in order to understand how our visitors find and use our site. We also monitor our website

performance, such as what pages our visitors navigate to in order to understand how to improve

our service and offerings, as well as measuring marketing efforts and user experience to ensure

intended and proper functionality.



If you do not want us to track your website interactions, you may revise your cookie preferences

on our website. We will not deny you access to our site or services should you choose to

decline the use of such tracking mechanisms, but when declined, there may be cases where the

user experience is not optimal.



What do we do with your information?

Besides the functionality necessary for our website and services to function, we may use

portions or aggregated numbers for internal marketing presentations or use Google Data Studio

for analytics.

We do not share or sell any information collected, even when anonymized.



Version 8.5 Page 7 of 17

Privacy Policy



Google provides some additional privacy options for Google Analytics cookies.



How long do we keep your information?

The information we collect will be anonymised and kept for a maximum of 38 months. Google

provides some additional privacy terms.

IP address to prevent fraud and identify geographical clusters of customers so we may serve

you better.



Version 8.5 Page 11 of 17

Privacy Policy

keep track of your engagement and ensure we send you relevant information or if you have

been inactive for more than the retention limit, we will ensure that your email will be deleted

from our database.

Read more about web beacons here.



We use UTM codes to identify specific sources of traffic and to customize content but never

used for profiling or other, user identifiable, tracking.

Read more about UTM codes here.



What do we do with your information?

The information you provide when you sign up to receive content from our website is stored and

Privacy Policy



purchasing. This is limited to information necessary to process your payment as detailed above

in When you purchase a product from our website.

The products are downloadable, and we do not track further usage of it, except as set forth

herein.



When you use our Export Server

This section outlines the information we collect from you when you use our Export Server. If you

choose to make use of this service, our legal basis for collecting information falls under the

premise of contractual obligations in reference to Article 6-1 (b), as this is a service that you can

use optionally, when you have purchased a license from us, and by using it, you agree to us

processing your chart - data. The export server is not to be used in cases where charts may

contain personal data. In such cases the Export server must be self-hosted, or alternatively the

offline export module can be used.

The export server converts either a chart configuration (in JSON format) or a vectorized chart (in

SVG format) to one of several possible output formats (namely PNG/JPEG/SVG/PDF). This is

offered as a service to our customers in order to convert charts to e.g. print-ready formats.



When using the export server, either as an API service or indirectly through the export module

in Highcharts Products Suite, your chart is sent to our server. This is the default behavior of the

export module. We also have an offline export module that operates without the need for a web

service, however, this is not fully compatible with all browsers and formats.



The file is publicly available, as it must be for the service to work, however, the filenames are

created using UUID’s and as such, it is highly unlikely that anyone would be able to guess the

filenames within the lifespan of the files. The export server itself is also fully open-source, so

you are free to host your own server should your company policies require more control over the

exporting process.



What do we do with your chart data?

We use the chart data in order to convert your chart to the desired output format.



How long do we keep your data?

When not using async exporting, the result from the chart export will be stored on our server for

15 minutes before it deletes itself.



Additional rights as a data subject

In collecting this information, we are acting as a data controller and you have additional rights

with regards to the data we store and process, which is outlined in the section below called

update-notices about the specific entry you commented or to initiate a private one-to-one email

conversation with you about your post.



How long do we keep your information for?

Your information is kept for as long as you continue to consent, but we cease to send you

updates and will remove your data from our records if you are inactive for more than 2 years.
