### 3\. **Storage of personal data and International Data Transfer**

Axur will store the information collected on cloud servers of service providers contracted by Axur, located in the state of Northern Virginia in the United States of America. Suppliers are evaluated to provide the security expected by Axur, so that all personal data processed by Axur is kept confidential, complete and accessible, when necessary. If there is any change to the cloud country, Axur will notify its Clients and the change will only be made if the new cloud provides the same degree of security, privacy and data protection. Furthermore, the data may also be accessed by employees and Clients located in other countries, with the same adequate degree of security and in accordance with the applicable law.  
  
Axur uses recognized and legally required means to preserve the privacy of the data collected. We note that Axur suppliers use a level similar to or more rigorous than the applicable nationals and international law. Therefore, it adopts the following precautions:  
  
i. When necessary, Axur uses standard and market methods to encrypt and anonymize the data collected;  
  
ii. Axur has protection against unauthorized access to its systems and databases; and  
  
iii. Those who come into contact with the information are contractually committed to granting strict confidential treatment regarding any personal data to which they have access, under penalty of liability, under the EUA and foreign laws.  
  
Axur uses its best efforts to preserve the privacy of user data. In addition, Axur includes all the practices of ISO 27001, ISO 27701 and TSC 2017 Section 100 in its business. However, no website/Platform is completely secure and Axur cannot fully guarantee that all information that passes through the pages will not be data subject to unauthorized access perpetrated through methods designed to improperly obtain information.  
  
For this reason, we encourage users to take appropriate measures to protect themselves, such as keeping all created usernames and passwords confidential.

### 4\. **Data Sharing**

Like any other technology company, Axur operates in partnership with a series of companies to offer its services and products, which have the same degree of security and commitment. Axur may disclose personal data collected from third parties in the following situations and within the limits authorized by law:  
  
  
i In the event of a consolidation, spin-off, acquisition, or merger of Axur;  
  
ii. For the purpose of delivering the product and/or service contracted by the Client with Axur;  
  
iii. When necessary to comply with a legal obligation, determination of a competent authority, or court order;  
  
iv. With suppliers, providers, and commercial partners: For example, cloud hosting companies, cyber security companies, security companies, companies that provide benefits to employees, among others.

### **5\. Legal events for disclosure of data**

In some cases, Axur may disclose personal data collected for the purpose of complying with the applicable law or through a judicial or administrative order or subpoena.

ii. Collaboration with investigations by public bodies and authorities and/or to protect national security;  
  
iii. Performance of agreements;iv. Investigation and defense of third-party allegations;

Information may be retained, for example: to comply with regulatory and contractual obligations, defense in litigation, among others.

### **7\. What are the data subjects’ rights and how to exercise them**

Some rights are guaranteed to data subjects, in accordance with applicable legislation in the USA, Brazil and foreign law. Below we provide examples:  
i. confirmation of the existence of processing;  
  
ii. access to data;  
  
iii. correction of incomplete, inaccurate, or outdated data;  
  
iv. anonymization, blocking, or deletion of unnecessary, excessive, or non-compliant data, if applicable;  
  
v. portability to another service or product provider, upon express request by the data subject;  
  
vi. deletion of data processed with the data subject's consent, if requested by them;  
  
viii. obtaining information about the public or private entities with which Axur shared your data, if permitted by law;  
  
viii. information about the possibility of not providing your consent, as well as being informed about the consequences in case of refusal; and

Axur is available to comply with the rights of data subjects through the subject's request, which shall be sent to the email address privacy@axur.com. In the event of a request to delete personal data from Axur's database, if it is found that there is a need to retain such personal data due to legal and regulatory obligations or based on any other legal basis, this will be informed to the data subject. It is important to note that as Axur is a B2B company and therefore does not have a legal relationship with data subjects in these cases, it is possible that the basis of processing are not based on consent, but this does not affect your right to object and to contact Axur.   
  
In cases where Axur acts as a Personal Data Operator and receives a request, it will be redirected to the data Controller, so that it can be responded to directly by him, within the legal term or Axur will indicate this aspect directly to the data subject.

### **8\. Contact of the personal Data Protection Officer**
