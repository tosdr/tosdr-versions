Ad Personalization and Opt Out Information

Google and other third party ad network/exchanges personalize ads to be more relevant.

Users in the United States may opt out of many third-party ad networks. For example, you may go to the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) [Consumer Choice Page](https://app.termly.io/dashboard/website/1c489055-1353-4aad-9754-f2cfc9c60b7c/privacy-policy#whoshare) for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding having information used by [DAA companies](http://www.aboutads.info/participating/).

Opting out from one or more companies listed on the DAA [Consumer Choice Page](https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN) or the [NAI Consumer Opt-Out Page](https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1) will opt you out from those companies’ delivery of interest-based content or ads to you, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any advertising through our sites or on other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you opt out on the DAA or NAI websites, your opt out may not be effective. Additional information is available on the DAA’s website at [aboutads.info](https://youradchoices.com/) or the NAI’s website at [networkadvertising.org](https://thenai.org/).
