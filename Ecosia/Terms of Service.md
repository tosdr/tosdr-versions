1\. Acceptance of the Terms of Service
======================================

Welcome to Ecosia! (a.k.a. "we" or "us" or the "Company"). We are excited to have you as user and member of the community. The following terms and conditions (collectively, these "Terms of Service") apply to your use of www.ecosia.org, including any content, functionality and services offered on or via Ecosia.org (the "Website"). The Terms of Service also include our Privacy Policy (-> link).

We want to keep our relationship with you as lean and informal as possible, but please read the Terms of Service carefully before you start using Ecosia, because by using the Website you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms of Service.

Should you disagree with some of the provisions herein, you can either leave the Website (although we'll be sad to see you go!), or contact us at info@ecosia.org. Ecosia is all about improving our level of service, and we'll be happy to hear your comments and suggestions.

You must treat such information as confidential, not disclosing it to any third party and only using Ecosia in person. There is a password reset procedure in case you forget your password, but please notify us of any breach of security.
