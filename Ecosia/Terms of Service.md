1\. Acceptance of the Terms of Service
======================================

Welcome to Ecosia! (a.k.a. "we" or "us" or the "Company"). We are excited to have you as user and member of the community. The following terms and conditions (collectively, these "Terms of Service") apply to your use of www.ecosia.org, including any content, functionality and services offered on or via Ecosia.org (the "Website"). The Terms of Service also include our Privacy Policy (-> link).

We want to keep our relationship with you as lean and informal as possible, but please read the Terms of Service carefully before you start using Ecosia, because by using the Website you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms of Service.

Should you disagree with some of the provisions herein, you can either leave the Website (although we'll be sad to see you go!), or contact us at info@ecosia.org. Ecosia is all about improving our level of service, and we'll be happy to hear your comments and suggestions.

In any case, we will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of the Website is unavailable at any time or for any period, nor for any data loss.

To access certain features of the Website you have to register by entering your email and choosing a password as part of our security procedures. You must treat such information as confidential, not disclosing it to any third party and only using Ecosia in person. There is a password reset procedure in case you forget your password, but please notify us of any breach of security. We highly recommend to choose a strong password (e.g. "[correcthorse](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://xkcd.com/936/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1721534729165509&usg=AOvVaw3moB7sttLN_7tjjLXXksvv)?12") and that you log out from your account at the end of every session.

It is a condition of your use of the Website that all the information you provide on the Website is correct, current and complete. As custom for internet websites, we reserve the right to disable any user account, at any time in our sole discretion for any or no reason, including, if in our opinion you have failed to comply with any provision of these Terms of Service.

We do not guarantee that the Website or any content provided on the Website is error free. We manage your personal data according to our Privacy Policy.
