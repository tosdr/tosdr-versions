Introduction
------------

Synology holds itself to high standards in handling and processing personal information. The statement outlined below establishes the boundaries of what Synology processes and what you, as our customer and the data subject ("**users**"), are entitled to. This Privacy Statement applies when you use our features and services ("**Services**"). Additionally, we have a Cookie Policy for use of our website.

Synology operates around the world and has adopted English as the controlling language of this Privacy Statement. Additional translations are provided for convenience. You may switch to other languages by using the language selection button at the bottom of the webpage.

This Privacy Statement applies to Synology-provided services offered on Synology-owned websites, Synology-branded applications, services provided from physical Synology products ("**Synology Devices**"), and digital or physical services directly offered by Synology.

Your Personal Data
------------------

Personal data refers to identifying information that relates to, describe, is capable of being associated with, or can reasonably be linked directly or indirectly to, an individual or a household. Identification can be by the data alone or in conjunction with any other data in the data controller's possession or likely to come into such possession. Synology collects information only to provide you with the Services and to improve user experiences. To provide you with Synology Devices or Services, including responding to your inquiries, we may ask for your personal information. If you choose not to provide the requested information, we may be unable to deliver the desired Services. Most of Synology's Services are provided under a Synology Account, and if you no longer require the Service or wish to have your data removed, you may delete your Synology Account.

In general, Synology collects personal data from you through your use of our Services. Synology also uses cookies and other technologies to gather information regarding a visitor's browsing preferences. The data we collect and store from you, including in the preceding 12 months, may consist of the following data categories:

* Your e-mail address, which is used as identification for our services and as the primary communication method.
* Your name, address, phone number, and additional contact information are used to provide registration, device shipping, and billing verification services.
* Your commercial information including payment method and financial data (credit card, bank account number, etc.), which is used for payment transactions for a service or product, logistics, and billing data (such as customs ID and tracking number).

Lawful Bases and Other Usage
----------------------------

The lawful bases for Synology to process your personal data for the various types of processing performed on your personal data are, as applicable, processing based on your consent, as necessary for us to enter into and to perform our contract with you, or in certain circumstances, as necessary for Synology to pursue our "legitimate interests", where our interests are not outweighed by your rights and freedoms.

"Legitimate interest" situations necessitating such actions may include the following: to protect you, us, or others from security threats, to comply with laws we are subjected to, to implement information sharing within Synology's group affiliates, to prevent fraud, misuse of company IT systems, to operate a whistleblowing scheme, for purposes of mergers and acquisitions, and to perform internal investigations and auditing.

Synology will collect, process, and use the personal data supplied by you only for the purposes communicated to you and will not disclose your data to third parties except under the lawful bases set forth above. Synology does not share your personal information with third parties for the purpose of direct marketing. Synology also does not engage in the selling of personal data to any third party.

The purposes for which Synology collects and processes personal data may include, but not limited to:

* Operating our websites to provide you access to and use of our websites and Services;
* Administering your use of our Services, to communicate with you and respond to your requests;
* Managing your Synology Account;

* Providing you with our online or offline marketing measures and activities; including but not limited to newsletters, online and live event registrations, and other promotional information and materials;
* Sharing your contact details with our subsidiaries, affiliates, authorized repair and support centers, authorized logistics companies, communications infrastructure, and other entities deemed necessary to carry out providing these Services to you;

You are not under any obligation to provide us any of your personal data. However, please note that without certain data from you, we may not able to undertake some or all of our obligations to you under our contract with you, or adequately provide you with our full range of services. If you would like to obtain more detail about this, please contact us following the instructions in the "Contact Information" section below.

Period of Storage
-----------------

Synology keeps your personal data for no longer than reasonably necessary for the given purpose for which your data is processed.

Notwithstanding the above, we may retain your personal data as required by applicable laws and regulations, as necessary to assist with any government and judicial investigations, to initiate or defend legal claims or for the purpose of civil, criminal, or administrative proceedings. If none of the above grounds for us to keep your data apply, we will delete and dispose of your data in a secure manner.

Data Controllers, Contracting Parties, Transfer of Data
-------------------------------------------------------

We use the term "**Designated Areas**" to refer to the residential locations that are in the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA), and Switzerland.

If you reside in the Designated Areas, **Synology Inc.** will be the controller of your personal data, except under limited circumstances where Synology holds marketing events in Germany, France, or the United Kingdom, for which **Synology GmbH**, **Synology France SARL**, or **Synology UK Ltd** will respectively be the controller of your personal data. Other than for such limited circumstances, **Synology Inc.** will be responsible for collecting and processing data for our Services, which will be covered by the Terms of Service of the relevant Services.

If you reside outside the Designated Areas, **Synology Inc.** will be the controller of your personal data. Your usage of services provided by Synology will be bound by the Terms of Service of the relevant Services.

Synology's Services include providing data processing, order fulfillment, technical support, device replacement, payment invoicing, processing and collection, event registration, customer services, marketing support, as well as the transfer of data based on users' decisions, around the world. The nature of these Services requires us to be able to transfer your personal data into and out of the European Union (EU) to Synology affiliates including **Synology GmbH** and **Synology Inc.**, authorized repair and support centers, authorized logistics companies, communications infrastructure, and other entities deemed necessary to carry out providing these Services. We may also transfer your data to third-party service providers whom we subcontract to work on our behalf or for us and therefore may have access to the data only for purposes of performing these tasks on our behalf and under obligations similar to those described in this Privacy Statement, who perform functions such as data processing, auditing, order fulfillment, managing and enhancing customer data, providing customer service, conducting customer research or satisfaction surveys, marketing support, payment processing and invoice collection support, informational systems technical support, to help us provide, analyze, and improve our Services and to assist us in detecting and dealing with data breaches, illegal activities, and fraud.

We may also provide your data to third parties involved in a legal proceeding if they provide us with a court order or substantially similar legal procedure requiring us to do so. The above parties are the recipients of your personal data.

Synology takes measures to ensure that your personal data is processed as required by this Privacy Statement and applicable laws, including to ensure your personal data is transferred to a residential location that has an adequate level of data protection approved by the European Commission. In circumstances where an adequate level of data protection is not available for the residential location of the data recipient, Synology requires that such recipient adopts European Commission-approved Standard Contractual Clauses with Synology as a legal mechanism for data transfer, to ensure that such data is safeguarded and processed by the recipient strictly within the restrictions and conditions set forth in such Standard Contractual Clauses.

Security
--------

Synology employs multiple methods of data protection in order to minimize the risk of misuse, unauthorized access and disclosure, and loss of access. Some of these safeguards include the use of pseudonymization, data encryption, data hashing, and other technologies and permission control methods. When our employees directly handle or access your personal information, we do so on secured networks and through fine-grained permission control to limit who can access your information. Data you provide to us is encrypted and stored on both third-party storage and on Synology-managed devices, depending on the service.

Synology logs and stores IP addresses of both users to our web services solely for security purposes. This log is archived and then removed at irregular intervals depending on ongoing or existing security threats or investigations. If Synology has overwhelming evidence that certain IP addresses, users, or devices may be purposely damaging or hindering our operations or service quality, we may deny further services and/or report such behavior to relevant authorities.

Synology removes data that is no longer required to provide services based on each service.

Changes to Statement
--------------------

Synology may make amendments to this document when needed to reflect statement updates, customer feedback, as well as new products or services. We will provide a brief overview of the changes, and if the terms modify the way we process or handle your data or affect your rights, we will notify you through direct message or by posting notices if we are unable to directly reach you. We encourage that you regularly review this Privacy Statement to understand how your data is handled.

------------------
