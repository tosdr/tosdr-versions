To the extent that you voluntarily post information about yourself publicly, such as a review, you understand and agree that your information is publicly accessible and we cannot, and will not, monitor or protect such information in any way.

Content available on or through the Site and/or Services that you did not create is our property, or used with our permission. You may not distribute, modify, transmit, reuse, download, repost, copy, or use said Content, whether in whole or in part, for commercial purposes or for personal gain, without express advance written permission from us.

### 5\. COPYRIGHT POLICY

We respect the intellectual property rights of others. It is our policy to respond to any claim that content on the Site or Services infringes on the copyright or other intellectual property rights of any person or entity.

_DMCA Compliance & Notice._ If you are a copyright owner, or authorized on behalf of one, and you believe that the copyrighted work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please submit your claim pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) by providing our Copyright Agent listed below with the following information in writing (see 17 U.S.C 512(c)(3) for further detail). To expedite our ability to process your request, please use the following format:

* An electronic or physical signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner;
* Identification of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed;
* Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing and where it is located on the Site;
* Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact you, such as your address, telephone number, and e-mail address;
* A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or law; and
* A statement, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information is accurate, and that you are the copyright owner or are authorized to act on behalf of the owner.

_DMCA Counter Notice._ If you disagree that the content that was taken down is an infringement of another’s work, you may elect to send us a counter notice. To be effective, your counter notice must be a written communication provided to our designated agent that includes substantially the following information (please consult your legal counsel or see Section 512(g)(3) of the Copyright Act to confirm these requirements). To expedite our ability to process your request, please use the format below:

* Your physical or electronic signature.
* Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled.
* A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.
* Your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address is located, or if the subscriber’s address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which the service provider may be found, and that the subscriber will accept service of process from the person who provided notification under subsection (c)(1)(C) or an agent of such person.

Please note that under the DMCA, any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing or was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification may be subject to liability. All reports and inquiries will be kept confidential, except to the extent necessary to investigate any alleged violation and enforce the terms and conditions of this Agreement. This Agreement is not legal advice, and we are not attorneys or copyright experts. Please consult with your legal representative if you believe your rights are being infringed, or if you wish to respond to an infringement notice. Before sending either a copyright infringement notification or counter-notification, you may wish to contact a lawyer to better understand your rights and obligations under the DMCA and other applicable laws. The following notice requirements are intended to comply with our rights and obligations under the DMCA and do not constitute legal advice. Where applicable, we will comply with the procedures outlined in the DMCA.

You can contact our Copyright Agent via email at [dmca@picclick.com](mailto:dmca@picclick.com), or via mail at PO Box 2234, Rancho Santa Fe, CA 92067. Please make the subject line of any email DMCA notice. You can also find our Copyright Agent information for DMCA complaints here.

Third parties such as eBay (i.e., not us) have their own DMCA procedures. If you believe a user on a third party site is infringing on your propriety work, please use that third party’s DMCA complaint procedure. To be clear, eBay has its own DMCA procedure (available [here](https://pages.ebay.com/seller-center/listing-and-marketing/verified-rights-owner-program.html)), and we cannot take down images or content from eBay itself. Therefore, if you believe eBay is displaying content that is infringing your rights, you also agree to use eBay’s DMCA procedure to take down this content.

The Site and Services are provided to you "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and with all faults and defects without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, we, on our own behalf and on behalf of our affiliates and our and their respective licensors and service providers, expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Site and Services, including all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of course of dealing, course of performance, usage or trade practice. Without limitation to the foregoing, we provide no warranty or undertaking, and make no representation of any kind that the Site and Services will meet your requirements, achieve any intended results, be compatible or work with any other software, applications, systems or services, operate without interruption, meet any performance or reliability standards or be error free or that any errors or defects can or will be corrected.

Without limiting the foregoing, we do not make any representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the Site and Services, or the information, content, and materials or products included thereon; (ii) that the Site and Services will be uninterrupted or error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, or currency of any information or content provided through the Site and Services; or (iv) that the Site and Services, the corresponding servers, the content, or e-mails sent from or on behalf of us are free of viruses, scripts, trojan horses, worms, malware, timebombs or other harmful components.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of or limitations on implied warranties or the limitations on the applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to you.

If you are based in the United Kingdom or European Economic Area, please see [Appendix 1](https://picclick.com/pages/terms.html#appendix1) instead.

### 12\. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall we be liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, for loss of data or other information, for business interruption, for personal injury, for loss of privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability to use the Site and Services, third party software and/or third party hardware used with the Site and Services, any conduct or content of any third party on the Site and Services, any content obtained from the Site and Services, unauthorized access, use or alteration of your transmissions or content, or otherwise in connection with any provision of this Agreement), even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.

Some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. If this exclusion or limitation of liability is held inappropriate or unenforceable for any reason, our maximum liability for any type of damages shall not exceed $50.

If you are based in the United Kingdom or European Economic Area, please see [Appendix 1](https://picclick.com/pages/terms.html#appendix1) instead.

### 13\. SEVERABILITY

If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.

### 14\. WAIVER

Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require performance of an obligation under this Agreement shall not effect a party's ability to exercise such right or require such performance at any time thereafter nor shall be the waiver of a breach constitute waiver of any subsequent breach.

### 15\. AMENDMENTS TO THIS AGREEMENT

We reserve the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace this Agreement at any time. If a revision is material we will provide at least 30 days notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion. We will post the notice of the changes on the homepage of our Site, for seven days after making the changes.

By continuing to access or use our Site and Services after any revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.

### 16\. ARBITRATION, JURY TRIAL & CLASS ACTIONS

Arbitration. _Please read this Section carefully. It is part of your agreement with us, and it affects your rights. It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION._

You agree that any dispute related to this Agreement, your use of the Site and Services, or any dispute related to your relationship with us or our affiliates, directors, officers, agents, shareholders, members, subsidiaries, parents, shall be submitted to binding arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA), located in San Diego, California. The AAA Rules of Arbitration shall govern all aspects of the arbitration you bring, including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with this Arbitration Agreement. The AAA Rules of Arbitration are available on the AAA’s website, [https://www.adr.org/Rules/](https://www.adr.org/Rules/). The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator, with the prevailing party to pay all costs and attorney fees. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

Jury Trial Waiver. _Please read this Section carefully. It is part of your agreement with us and affects your rights. It contains a WAIVER OF YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL._

You hereby waive your constitutional and statutory rights to go to court and have a trial in front of a judge or a jury, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and us in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.

Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. _Please read this Section carefully. It is part of your agreement with us and affects your rights. It contains a WAIVER OF YOUR CLASS ACTION RIGHTS._

ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.

30-Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt out of the Arbitration, Jury Trial Waiver and Class Action Waiver Provisions of this Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: PO Box 2234, Rancho Santa Fe, CA 92067, within 30 days from the date you first create use the Services. If you send this notice, then the Arbitration, Jury Trial Waiver and Class Action Waiver Provisions will not apply, and you must bring claims per the Section labeled “Governing Law,” below. If you do not send this notice, then you agree to be bound by the terms of the Arbitration, Jury Trial Waiver and Class Action Waiver Provisions in this Section. Agreeing to arbitration and waiving your rights to jury trial and class action participation is an important decision for you to make. It can shorten the litigation process and result in cost savings, but it also takes away certain rights, such as the right to a trial in front of your peers. Thus, please take time to carefully consider the Arbitration, Jury Trial Waiver and Class Action Waiver Provisions of this Agreement. Since the information provided in this Agreement is not intended to contain a complete explanation of the consequences of arbitration, class action or jury waiver, you may want to consult an attorney.

If you are based in the United Kingdom or European Economic Area, please see [Appendix 1](https://picclick.com/pages/terms.html#appendix1) instead.
