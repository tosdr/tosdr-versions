We may combine information that we collect via one method (e.g., a website, our digital advertising) with information that we have collected via another method (e.g., an offline event). We do this to get a more complete view of our consumers, which, in turn, allows us to serve you better and with more customization.

The type of information we collect depends on the Sites and Services you use and how you use them.  The type of personal information we collect includes:

* **Your contact information/identifiers**, such as your name, your gamer id, mailing address, email address, employer, primary language, country, social media credentials. preferred games and date of birth. If you contact us by telephone, we will also retain your telephone number.

* **If you play our games (including alpha and beta playtesting), data around your gameplay**, such as crash information and disconnects, your IP address, your hardware information, gameplay stats, the version of our game you played, in-game timestamps, clicks, scrolling, browsing times, browsing heatmaps, searches, referral/exit pages, and how you interacted with other players.

Please note that the specific data stored for this purpose may not be disclosed to you or any third parties, since the disclosure will compromise the mechanism through which we detect, investigate and prevent frauds and cheating in the Services, as well as other EULA violations.
