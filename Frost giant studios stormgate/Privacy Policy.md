This section describes the information we collect, including information that you provide to us, information automatically collected and information from third parties. We may combine information that we collect via one method (e.g., a website, our digital advertising) with information that we have collected via another method (e.g., an offline event). We do this to get a more complete view of our consumers, which, in turn, allows us to serve you better and with more customization.

The type of information we collect depends on the Sites and Services you use and how you use them.  The type of personal information we collect includes:

* **Your contact information/identifiers**, such as your name, your gamer id, mailing address, email address, employer, primary language, country, social media credentials. preferred games and date of birth. If you contact us by telephone, we will also retain your telephone number.

* **Your device and browsing information**, including non-personally identifiable information about your phone, tablet, computer or device and online browsing activity, which may be automatically collected.  This may include IP addresses, unique identifiers, cookie identifiers, browser language, device and browser settings and broad location-based information, and internet service provider information.  It may also include information about when and how you accessed and used our Sites, how you navigated to our Sites (such as the date and time of your visit), the links you clicked, the websites you visited before and after our Sites, and what you searched for while on our Sites.
* **If you play our games (including alpha and beta playtesting), data around your gameplay**, such as crash information and disconnects, your IP address, your hardware information, gameplay stats, the version of our game you played, in-game timestamps, clicks, scrolling, browsing times, browsing heatmaps, searches, referral/exit pages, and how you interacted with other players.
* **Your use of Frost Giant in-game social features** like voice and text chat where the information you share may be collected and used by us to ensure compliance with our EULA or viewed, collected or used by others via screenshot, audio recording, video recording or livestream.

* **If you participate in one of our esports competitions**, we may publish additional personal profile information on our ranking, bracket and tournament standings pages,  ladders,  leaderboards, Sites and Discord servers.  For example, in addition to the player information listed above, we may include your geographic location (state, province, country)  prize pool earnings, ranking, gameplay stats, and replay files.

We may make use of your gameplay data and reports from other players to uncover patterns of abusive or inappropriate behavior which do not comport with our EULA.

**Analytics & Interest-Based Ads**.

If the data can be used to prove that cheating or another fraud, EULA violation has occurred, we will further store the data for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims during the applicable statute of limitations. Please note that the specific data stored for this purpose may not be disclosed to you or any third parties, since the disclosure will compromise the mechanism through which we detect, investigate and prevent frauds and cheating in the Services, as well as other EULA violations.
