SPN requests You to review our Privacy Policy to understand our practices in terms of protection of Your personal information.  
  
If You do not wish to be bound by these Terms of Use or any of SPN's aforesaid policies, SPN requests You to not avail the Subscription (defined below in Clause 5.1) of SonyLIV or access SonyLIV.

No contract for the Subscription will subsist between You and SPN unless and until SPN accepts Your order by way of an e-mail confirmation. That acceptance will be deemed complete and will be deemed for all purposes to have been effectively communicated to You at the time SPN sends the e-mail to You (whether or not You receive or read that e-mail – please check Your junk e-mail folder if You do not receive an e-mail confirmation). This confirmation e-mail amounts to an acceptance by SPN of Your offer to take a Subscription of SonyLIV from SPN. This confirmatory e-mail will incorporate these Terms of Use which will become legally binding on You. You must check that the details on this confirmatory e-mail are correct as soon as possible and You should print out and keep a copy of it.

**1.4.**SPN or its content providers, are the owners or license holders of the intellectual property rights in the content on SonyLIV.

SPN does not control such third-party platforms and therefore SPN does not commit to making SonyLIV and/or content from SonyLIV available on any particular third-party platform and shall have no liability to You if SonyLIV or the content from SonyLIV ceases to be available on a particular third-party platform during Your subscription to such third-party platform. Your use of any third-party platform is subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable platform provider.

**1.6.3.**the access to SonyLIV may not be uninterrupted, timely, secure or error-free; and  
  
**1.6.4.**from time-to-time SPN may need to close or suspend the accessibility to the website or the application of SonyLIV to carry out upgrades and/or maintenance,  
  

but, for any significant suspension of the entirety of SonyLIV for reasons other than specified in Clause 1.8.4, SPN will refund to You, on a pro rata basis, the Subscription payments made by You for the portion of Your Subscription period for which SonyLIV was not available subject to the conditionalities provided under this Terms of Use.

**5.7. Free Trials:**In certain selected territories, You may be offered at the discretion of SPN a free trial period at the start of Your Subscription of SonyLIV.
