### 1\. What’s a cookie?

A cookie is a small piece of text sent to your terminal (computer, tablet, smartphone, etc.) by our Websites that you visit thanks to your browser.

Cookies deposited on your terminal can only be read by its issuer who is able, during their period of validity, to recognize your terminal each time you access digital content containing cookies from the said issuer. A cookie does not identify you personally, but only the browser on your terminal. Your browser will keep it for a certain period of time, and will send it back to the web server each time you reconnect to it.

When you use our Applications, an identifier of your mobile phone or tablet may be sent to us depending on the preferences you have expressed in your mobile phone or tablet, to track certain activities for advertising purposes.

In iOS, this identifier is called “IDFA” (ID for Advertising). In Android (Google Play), this identifier is called “AAID” (Android Advertising ID).
