**2\. Personal Data**
---------------------

### **2.1**  **Personal information we process :**

Euronews may need to process your Personal Data in the context of various Processing operations. Euronews has defined purposes in order to justify each Processing of your Personal Data.

In order to provide you with the Services offered on the Site, Euronews may process Personal Data concerning your activity on the Site in particular, such as browsing Data or subscription Data. This may be Data that you have directly communicated, in particular in the context of your subscription to our newsletters, or in the context of your registration in some of our events, or when you answer polls and surveys. This may also be Data that you have not directly communicated and which are collected automatically according to your browsing.

The provision of your Personal Data is most often mandatory to enable us to achieve the purposes for which they are processed. When Data is optional, we specify it to you.

### **2.2**  **Why and how do we process your Personal Data? How long do we store your Data?**

Euronews carries out most of the Processing of your Data as Data Controller. However, some Services may involve the Processing of your Data by third parties such as our Data Processors or other Data Controllers.

Your Personal Data is kept for the time necessary to achieve the purposes for which it is processed. The retention period of your Personal Data may depend on the type of Personal Data processed, the purposes of the Processing, our legitimate interest, the exercise or not of your rights as Data Subjects or even certain legal provisions requiring us to keep it. Once the retention period has expired or your right to withdrawal, erasure or object has been exercised, your Personal Data is deleted. In some cases, they may be anonymized, which irreversibly prevents any re-identification of the Data Subjects and thus no longer constitutes Personal Data within the meaning of the GDPR.

For each Processing purpose, Euronews has determined a legal basis in order to justify the Processing of your Personal Data.

The table below presents all the Processing carried out on the Site, their purposes, their legal bases, the Personal Data concerned and their retention periods by Euronews.

**_3\. Specificities relating to some Processing activities_**
--------------------------------------------------------------

### **_Newsletters_**

When you subscribe to our newsletters, you consent to the use of your email address to receive these newsletters. In order to avoid misuse of email addresses, we send you an email and ask you to confirm your email address to validate your registration as part of an automated process (double opt-in procedure). The newsletters sent to you can be personalized according to your behavioral data on the Site if you give your consent to the use of cookies in this sense on our CMP (consent management platform).

On the second interface for subscribing to our newsletters, we invite you to fill out a form. The additional Personal Data that you voluntarily provide to us (the form being optional) are processed on the basis of our legitimate interest in order to better know our audience of subscribers and to establish statistics.

Your email address may also be used for the purpose of targeting advertising on our Site, if you expressly consent to this in the form using a checkbox. We share your email address with one of our service providers who acts as joint data controller and who will proceed directly to its pseudonymization via the SHA256 hash function, i.e. it will transform your email address into a string of 256 bits which will constitute a unique fingerprint in order to make your re-identification impossible. Indeed, once the hashing process has been completed, our service provider immediately deletes your email address so that you cannot be re-identified. Our service provider creates an envelope that contains your identifier created on the basis of your hashed email address combined with other Personal Data collected thanks to the cookie dropped on your terminal by LiveRamp if you have consented to it via our CMP , which are stored in our first party storage which to show you personalized advertisements.

Please note that our service provider may also use your Personal Data on the basis of its legitimate interest for internal quality assurance and troubleshooting purposes. In this case, our service provider acts as data controller and Euronews is not responsible for the processing carried out. For more information on this processing and your rights, please read [the privacy policy](https://liveramp.uk/privacy/service-privacy-policy/) and [the information on the Transparency & Consent Framework of the IAB](https://liveramp.fr/tcf/) from our service provider LiveRamp.

Euronews has signed an agreement with this service provider based in the United States on the protection of Personal Data including the new standard contractual clauses of June 4, 2021 adopted by the European Commission. You can obtain a copy of these clauses by sending us a request.

### **_Comments on our articles_**

We offer you the opportunity to comment on our articles. We use one of our service providers with whom you must register. Your Personal Data such as your name, email address and your browsing and connection data according to the choice you have made on our CMP regarding the deposit of cookies are collected by our service provider who acts as Joint Data Controller. By using this service, you are informed that this service provider is located outside the European Economic Area. Euronews has signed a data protection agreement and the new standard contractual clauses of June 4, 2021 adopted by the European Commission with this service provider.

Euronews has access to statistical data relating to the use of the commentary service in order to understand the effectiveness and relevance of its articles on the Site and may moderate comments.

### **_Events_**

You may participate to events organized by Euronews. In that case, you will have to register and we may retain your information for a period of 3 years after your last interaction with us in order to invite you to future events. Your information will be stored at Euronews and through our processor named Swoogo, whose Data centers are located in Europe. If you share any sensitive information with us, we will delete it right after the event. 

### **_Polls and Surveys_**

### **_Targeted advertising_**

Free and open access to the content of the Site is financed by revenue from advertising broadcast on the Site. Targeted advertising display technologies may be used.

Targeted advertising is carried out almost exclusively by means of cookies or other similar technologies (hereinafter “**_cookies_**“). A cookie does not allow you to be identified directly. It allows its issuer to recognize your terminal and to collect a certain amount of information relating to the browsing that you carry out from this terminal. For more information, please refer to our [Cookies Policy](https://www.euronews.com/cookie-policy). The deposit of cookies can only be carried out with your consent except in certain specific cases. You can manage your consents at any time via our CMP.

The main purpose of this processing is to create user profiles in order to serve you targeted advertising.

Please note that refusing to give your consent to view targeted advertising does not mean that you will no longer see advertising on the Site, but that the advertisements displayed will no longer be personalized according to your Personal Data.

### **_Video players_**

When you view our video content on the Site, you may watch it using a number of video players we utilize globally.

YouTube API

One of those players is the unbranded version of YouTube video player developed by Google Ireland Ltd, which acts as a separate and independent data controller to offer you the best experience by watching our video content. This may involve processing of your Personal Data. Please read [YouTube’s Terms of Service](https://www.youtube.com/t/terms) since by watching our videos hosted by YouTube, you agree to be bound by those Terms of Service. To understand how Google may use your Personal Data collected based on cookies or other technology when watching our videos, please read [Google’s privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

Dailymotion

Please read [Privacy Policy – Dailymotion Legal](https://legal.dailymotion.com/en/privacy-policy/) since by watching our videos hosted by Dailymotion, you agree to be bound by this PrivacyPolicy.

How do we use your Personal Data from YouTube and external video players?

Euronews uses aggregated Personal Data from the YouTube API, Dailymotion and Jwplayer by virtue of a legitimate interest to establish statistics on our video content and their performance. Euronews needs to employ external video players to display its video content as a media. This is necessary to ensure an optimum user viewing experience. After weighing our legitimate interest mentioned above against your fundamental rights and freedoms, we believe that our legitimate interest does not override your fundamental rights and freedoms and that such legitimate interest can be reasonably expected by you when you watch news content on our website. Euronews does not use aggregated Personal Data to re-identify you or for any marketing purposes.

The Site may contain links to other sites not belonging to Euronews. When you click on such links, please refer to the Personal Data protection policies of each of these sites, whose processing of Personal Data is not carried out by Euronews.

**4\. Who has access to your Personal Data and to whom is it disclosed?**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Your Personal Data can be accessed by our internal services in charge of the management of the Services. In order to achieve the purposes for which a Processing is put in place, and therefore provide you with our Services, Euronews must sometimes use service providers and share your Personal Data with them. These service providers, called Data Processors, may be located within the European Economic Area or outside. Euronews signs a Personal Data protection agreement with each of its Data Processors to ensure the security of your Personal Data. When a Data Processor is located outside the European Economic Area or its activity is carried out outside the European Economic Area, and this Data Processor or its activity is not located in a country which has been subject to an adequacy decision adopted by the European Commission, Euronews implements appropriate measures such as the standard contractual clauses of the European Commission in order to ensure an adequate level of protection of your Data. A copy of the guarantees implemented are available on request.
