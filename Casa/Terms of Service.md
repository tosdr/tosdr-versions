**Casa Terms of Service  
**
============================

**We are Casa Inc. (“Casa”, “we”, “us” or “our”). Please read these Terms of Service (together with our** [**Privacy and Data Protection Policy**](https://keys.casa/privacy)**, the “Terms of Service” or “Terms”) fully and carefully before using** [**https://casa.io/**](https://casa.io/) **(the “Site”), our mobile applications for iOS and Android (each, an “App”), and the services, features, products, content or applications offered by Casa (together with the Site and the Apps, the “Services”).**

### 1\. Acceptance of Terms of Service  

1. These Terms of Service are a binding contract between you and Casa. By registering for and/or using the Services in any manner, including but not limited to visiting or browsing the Site or downloading one or both of the Apps, you agree to and accept these Terms of Service and all other rules, policies and procedures that may be published from time to time on the Site or such Apps by us, each of which is incorporated by reference and each of which may be updated from time to time.  
    
2. These Terms of Service apply to all users of the Services, registered or otherwise. Certain of the Services may be subject to additional terms and conditions specified by us from time to time; your use of such Services is subject to those additional terms and conditions, which are incorporated into these Terms of Service by reference. For example, additional terms and conditions may apply to you if you have purchased a Product, subscribed to a Paid Service (each term defined below); any such terms and conditions are hereby deemed a part of these Terms of Service.  
    
3. We are constantly trying to improve our Services, and may need to change these Terms of Service. We reserve the right to change the Terms of Service at any time, in our sole discretion, but if we do, we will bring it to your attention by placing a notice on the Site and/or sending you an electronic mail. If you don’t agree with the new Terms of Service, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the Services. If you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.  
    
4. If you are using the Services on behalf of a company, entity, or organization, then you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of that company, entity, or organization with the authority to bind such organization to these Terms, and agree to be bound by these Terms on behalf of such company, entity, or organization.  
    
5. PLEASE NOTE: These Terms of Service cover important information about the Services and any charges, taxes, and fees that we bill you, and include information about automatic renewals, limitations of liability, a class action waiver, and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court. EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES DESCRIBED IN THE ARBITRATION SECTION BELOW, YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.  
    

### 2\. About Casa and the Services  

**The Services are a platform for managing cryptographic keys and nodes. The Services are not an exchange for buying, selling, or trading digital or virtual currency or assets (an “Exchange”), and Casa is not a bank or other financial institution. The Services do not and cannot sell, hold, invest, send or receive money or cause or effect any digital or virtual currency or asset transactions. BY USING THE SERVICES IN ANY MANNER, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT (A) CASA IS NOT IN THE BUSINESS OF PROVIDING FINANCIAL, LEGAL, TAX, ACCOUNTING, OR INVESTMENT ADVICE OR SERVICES, (B) NONE OF THE SERVICES ARE INTENDED TO PROVIDE OR CONTAIN ANY SUCH ADVICE OR SERVICES, AND (C) ANY AND ALL SERVICES ARE PROVIDED FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. Casa urges you to consult a qualified professional for any such advice or service.  
**

### 3\. Eligibility  

**You must be at least 16 years of age to use the Services. If you are under age 16, you may not, under any circumstances or for any reason, use the Services. We may, in our sole discretion, refuse to offer the Services to any person or entity and change its eligibility criteria at any time. You are solely responsible for ensuring that these Terms of Service are in compliance with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to you and the right to access the Services is revoked where these Terms of Service or use of the Services is prohibited or to the extent offering, sale or provision of the Services conflicts with any applicable law, rule or regulation. Further, the Services are offered only for your own use, and not for the use or benefit of any third party.  
**

### 4\. Account Registration  

**To use the Services, you may be required to register for an account on the Services (an “Account”). To register an Account, you may be required to enter personal information such as your first name and email address (collectively, “Account Information”). You promise to provide us with accurate, complete, and updated Account Information about yourself and/or the company, entity, or organization you represent. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your Account, and for keeping your Account Information secure. You should never publish, distribute or post login information for your Account. You may not use Account Information that you don’t have the right to use, or with the intent to impersonate another person. You must notify us immediately of any change in your eligibility to use the Services (including any changes to or revocation of any licenses from state authorities), breach of security or unauthorized use of your Account. You may not transfer your Account to anyone else without our prior written permission. You shall have the ability to delete your Account, either directly or through a request made to one of our employees.  
**

### 5\. Use of the Services  

1. **Content.** **For purposes of these Terms of Service, the term “Content” includes, without limitation, information, data, text, photographs, videos, audio clips, written posts and comments, software, scripts, graphics, and interactive features generated, provided, or otherwise made accessible on or through the Services.**  
    
2. **Notices and Restrictions.** The Services’ entire contents, features, and functionality (including but not limited to all Content) are owned by Casa, its licensors, or other providers of such material and are protected by United States and international copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, and other intellectual property or proprietary rights laws. You shall abide by and maintain all copyright notices, information, and restrictions contained in any Content accessed through the Services. Any unauthorized use of any Content or materials in the Services is strictly prohibited and may violate copyright and trademark laws, and/or the laws of privacy, publicity, and/or communications regulations and statutes.  
    
3. **Use License.** **Subject to these Terms of Service, we grant each user of the Services a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable and non-transferable license to use the Services and the Content solely for personal or internal business purposes and only in accordance with these Terms of Service. Use, reproduction, modification, distribution or storage of any Services or Content for any other purpose is expressly prohibited without prior written permission from us. You shall not sell, license, rent, or otherwise use or exploit any Services or Content for commercial use or in any way that violates any third party right; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, if you are an entity, you may use the Services solely for internal business purposes in accordance with these Terms.**   
    
4. **License Grant**. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you hereby do and shall grant Casa a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable (except for the purposes provided herein), royalty-free license to access and use your Account Information and any other information you provide us solely for the purpose of providing you the Services. Further, you hereby do and shall consent to Casa’s collection, storage, and use of personally identifiable information, and to the transfer and hosting of such data on Casa’s servers located in the United States and elsewhere in the world, in accordance with the foregoing license grant. Please note that Casa takes the privacy of its users very seriously; click here for Casa’s current [Privacy and Data Protection Policy](https://keys.casa/privacy) to learn more.  
    
5. **Availability of Content.** **We do not guarantee that any Content will be made available on the Site or through the Services. We reserve the right to, but do not have any obligation to, (i) remove, edit or modify any Content in our sole discretion, at any time, without notice to you and for any reason (including, but not limited to, upon receipt of claims or allegations from third parties or authorities relating to such Content or if we are concerned that you may have violated these Terms of Service), or for no reason at all and (ii) to remove or block any Content from the Services.**  
    
6. **Private Keys.** **You acknowledge that you have sole and exclusive control over any and all private cryptographic keys created and controlled by you through the Services (“Private Keys”), and that Casa is unable to replace them in the event of their loss or theft. You further acknowledge and agree that (i) you are solely responsible for maintaining the security of each of the Private Keys and tracking the location of any hardware devices on which Private Keys are stored (“Authorized Devices”); (ii) Casa shall not be responsible for your acts or the acts of any third party with respect to the Private Keys or Authorized Devices; and (iii) you shall not, under any circumstances, provide or make available to Casa any of the Private Keys. You must notify Casa immediately in the event of any actual or suspected breach of security or unauthorized use of the Private Key(s) and cooperate with Casa and its authorized representatives in connection with any investigation of same.**  
    
7. **Recovery Key.** **You acknowledge and agree that if you choose to authorize Casa to control a cryptographic key created by you through the Services (a “Recovery Key”), (i) Casa will have sole and exclusive control over such Recovery Key; (ii) Casa will refuse to provide you with such Recovery Key unless and until Casa has determined (in its sole discretion) that it has verified your identity through use of your Account Information, and that such refusal and verification constitute an essential basis of the bargain sought by you in signing up for a Membership (defined below); and (iii) you will cease to have access to the Recovery Key upon any termination of the Services provided to you, whether terminated by you or by Casa. You further acknowledge that the Services may require the transmission of multiple cryptographic keys to an Exchange in order to access your digital or virtual currency or assets, and that the Recovery Key alone may therefore be insufficient for such access without at least one (1) or more Private Keys, depending on the Services applicable to your Membership.**  
    
8. **Third Party Services.** **In connection with the Services, Casa may use, or may provide you with access to, hardware devices, software, source code or other technology licensed to Casa from third parties, and which may be owned by such third parties (collectively, “Third Party Materials”). You acknowledge and agree that Casa does not make any warranties or guarantees regarding Third Party Materials and is not responsible for the operation or failure of any Third Party Materials, including without limitation the privacy practices, data security processes or other aspects related to Third Party Materials. You further acknowledge and agree that any Authorized Devices are each subject to their own terms and conditions separate and apart from this Agreement. You agree to waive any claim against Casa with respect to such Third Party Materials and release Casa from any associated liability.**

These Third Party Services are not under our control, and you acknowledge that we are not responsible or liable for the content, functions, accuracy, legality, appropriateness or any other aspect of such Third Party Services.

**

### 8\. Payments and Billing  

1. **Paid Services.** Certain of our Services are subject to payments (the “Paid Services”). Please see [here](https://keys.casa/old-pricing) for a description of the current Paid Services, including our various membership services (“Memberships”) where we offer for purchase Casa’s own products (“Casa Products”) and the products of third party providers (such products “Third Party Products” and such providers “Third Party Providers”) through the Services. Please note that any payment terms presented to you in the process of using or signing up for a Paid Service or purchasing Casa Products or Third Party Products (individually and collectively, “Products”) are deemed part of this Terms of Service.  
    
2. **Billing**. Depending on which payment option you choose, we either (i) use Stripe, a third-party payment processor (the “Payment Processor”), to bill you, through a payment account linked to your Account on the Services (your “Billing Account”), or (ii) bill you directly using BTCPay, for payment in a digital currency accepted by us at the time of the transaction (a “Casa-Accepted Digital Currency”), for use of the Paid Services, and for any purchases of Products that you make through your Account. If you do not have an Account on the Services and purchase Products, we either use the Payment Processor to bill you through a payment method accepted by the Payment Processor at the time of your purchase or bill you directly using BTCPay, again depending on your chosen payment method. You acknowledge that your payments will be subject to the terms and conditions (including without limitation exchange and conversion rates) and privacy policies of the financial institution, credit card or debit card issuer, Exchange, or other provider of your chosen payment method, as applicable, in addition to these Terms of Service. (The processing of payments by our Payment Processor will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor in addition to this Terms of Service, which for United States users can be found [here](https://stripe.com/us/privacy).) We are not responsible for errors by the Payment Processor or by your chosen financial institution, credit card or debit card issuer, Exchange, or other payment provider, and reserve the right to correct any such errors or mistakes even if payment has already been requested or received. By choosing to use Paid Services, including Memberships, and/or purchase Products, you agree to pay us, either through the Payment Processor or directly in a Casa-Accepted Digital Currency, as applicable, all charges at the prices then in effect for any use of such Paid Services or purchase of such Products, in accordance with the applicable payment terms, and you authorize us to charge your chosen payment provider through the Payment Processor or to transfer Casa-Accepted Digital Currency from your holdings in an Exchange directly to Casa (your “Payment Method”). You agree to make payment using that selected Payment Method.  
    
3. **Payment Method.** The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer, Exchange or other provider of your chosen Payment Method. If we, through the Payment Processor, do not receive payment from you, you agree to pay all amounts due on your Billing Account upon demand.  
    
4. **Recurring Billing**. Some of the Paid Services may consist of an initial period, for which there is a one-time charge, followed by recurring period charges as agreed to by you. By choosing a recurring payment plan, you acknowledge that such Services have an initial and recurring payment feature and you accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation. WE MAY SUBMIT PERIODIC CHARGES (E.G., MONTHLY OR YEARLY) WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM YOU, UNTIL YOU PROVIDE PRIOR NOTICE (RECEIPT OF WHICH IS CONFIRMED BY US) THAT YOU HAVE TERMINATED THIS AUTHORIZATION OR WISH TO CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD. SUCH NOTICE WILL NOT AFFECT CHARGES SUBMITTED BEFORE WE REASONABLY COULD ACT. TO TERMINATE YOUR AUTHORIZATION OR CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD, EMAIL [HELP@TEAM.CASA](mailto:help@team.casa).  
    
5. **Current Information Required**. YOU MUST PROVIDE CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE INFORMATION FOR YOUR PAYMENT METHOD. YOU MUST PROMPTLY UPDATE ALL INFORMATION TO KEEP YOUR PAYMENT METHOD CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE (SUCH AS A CHANGE IN BILLING ADDRESS, CREDIT CARD NUMBER, OR CREDIT CARD EXPIRATION DATE), AND YOU MUST PROMPTLY NOTIFY US OR OUR PAYMENT PROCESSOR (IF APPLICABLE) IF YOUR PAYMENT METHOD IS CANCELED (E.G., FOR LOSS OR THEFT) OR IF YOU BECOME AWARE OF A POTENTIAL BREACH OF SECURITY, SUCH AS THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR USE OF YOUR USER NAME OR PASSWORD. CHANGES TO SUCH INFORMATION CAN BE MADE AT BY EMAILING [HELP@TEAM.CASA](mailto:help@team.casa).  IF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE ANY OF THE FOREGOING INFORMATION, YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY CONTINUE CHARGING YOU FOR ANY USE OF PAID SERVICES UNDER YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT UNLESS YOU HAVE TERMINATED YOUR PAID SERVICES AS SET FORTH ABOVE.  
    
6. **Change in Amount Authorized**. If the amount to be charged to your Billing Account or Exchange varies from the amount you preauthorized (other than due to the imposition or change in the amount of state sales taxes), you have the right to receive, and we shall provide, notice of the amount to be charged and the date of the charge before the scheduled date of the transaction. Any agreement you have with your payment provider or Exchange will govern your use of your Payment Method. You agree that we may accumulate charges incurred and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each billing cycle.  
    
7. **Auto-Renewal for Membership Services**. Unless you opt out of auto-renewal, which can be done by emailing [help@team.casa](mailto:help@team.casa), any Memberships you have signed up for will be automatically extended for successive renewal periods of the same duration as the subscription term originally selected, at the then-current non-promotional rate. To change or resign your Membership at any time, email [help@team.casa](mailto:help@team.casa). If you terminate a Membership (either by termination or opting out of auto-renewal), you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current term; your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires. However, you won’t be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then-current subscription period. In the event you would like to reactivate your Membership, you will incur a reactivation fee as determined by us and you will be obligated to pay, in addition to the new subscription fee, the subscription fee for the period beginning on the date your Membership expired through the date of reactivation.  
    
8. **Reaffirmation of Authorization**. Your non-termination or continued use of a Membership, or other Paid Service that is offered on a subscription basis, reaffirms that we are authorized to charge your Payment Method for that Paid Service. We may submit those charges for payment and you will be responsible for such charges. This does not waive our right to seek payment directly from you. Your charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when you initially selected to use the Paid Service.  
    
9. **Free Trials and Other Promotions**. Any rules, policies, or procedures presented to you in connection with a free trial or promotional offer, shall govern such free trial and promotional offer and shall be incorporated into these Terms of Service. Any free trial or other promotion that provides access to a Paid Service must be used within the specified time of the trial. You must stop using a Paid Service before the end of the trial period in order to avoid being charged for that Paid Service. If you cancel prior to the end of the trial period and are inadvertently charged for a Paid Service, please contact us at [help@team.casa](mailto:help@team.casa).  
    

### 9\. Products  

1. **Product Descriptions and Availability**. Descriptions, images, references, features, content, specifications, products, prices, and availability of any Products made available through the Services are subject to change without notice. The inclusion of any Products on the Services at a particular time does not imply or warrant that these products will be available at any time. We reserve the right, with or without prior notice, to limit the available quantity of or discontinue any Product on the Services; to bar any user from making any or all purchases; or to refuse to provide any user with any product.  
    
2. **Pricing**. Prices do not include any shipping and handling charges, or taxes, which will be noted in the payment terms presented to you during the checkout process.  
    
3. **Your Legal Obligations**. It is your responsibility to ascertain and obey all applicable local, state, federal, and international laws (including minimum age requirements) in regard to the possession, use, and sale of any Product purchased through the Services. By placing an order, you represent that the Products ordered will be used only in a lawful manner.  
    
4. **Returns, Refunds, and Fees**. Please review our policy [here](https://keys.casa/refund-policy), which are incorporated into these Terms of Service by reference.  
    
5. **Customer Service**. If you have any questions about a particular Product, or you have questions about shipping, returns, or refunds, please contact us at [help@team.casa](mailto:help@team.casa).  
    

### **10\. For Premium (formerly “Platinum”) and Private Client (formerly “Diamond”) Account Members – Account Access by Third Parties**

Each member who has a Shared Account (each, a “Shared Account Member”), without the consent of the other Shared Account Member, may, and hereby is authorized by the other Shared Account Member, to conduct any transaction permitted under these Terms, the Membership, and any other agreement with Casa. Casa may require Shared Account Members to create separate usernames and passwords to access the Account associated with the Shared Account.

All shared Account Members, jointly and severally, are liable for all transactions, changes, additions or cancellation of an Account or Membership, and for any charges, fees, losses or liabilities incurred for any transaction, change, addition or cancellation of an Account or Membership regardless of which member conducted or benefited from the transaction, change, addition or cancellation.

### **18\. ARBITRATION CLAUSE & CLASS ACTION WAIVER – IMPORTANT – PLEASE REVIEW AS THIS AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS**  

1. **Arbitration**. YOU AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US (WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DISPUTE INVOLVES A THIRD PARTY) WITH REGARD TO YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH US, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DISPUTES RELATED TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, AND/OR RIGHTS OF PRIVACY AND/OR PUBLICITY, WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION UNDER THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION’S RULES FOR ARBITRATION OF CONSUMER-RELATED DISPUTES AND YOU AND WE HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU HAVE IN ANY MANNER VIOLATED OR THREATENED TO VIOLATE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, WE MAY SEEK INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER APPROPRIATE RELIEF IN ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK. DISCOVERY AND RIGHTS TO APPEAL IN ARBITRATION ARE GENERALLY MORE LIMITED THAN IN A LAWSUIT, AND OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU AND WE WOULD HAVE IN COURT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local “small claims” court, if permitted by that small claims court’s rules and if within such court’s jurisdiction, unless such action is transferred, removed or appealed to a different court. You may bring claims only on your own behalf.  Neither you nor we will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement to arbitrate. YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS MEMBER ON ANY CLASS CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST US INCLUDING ANY RIGHT TO CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY CONSOLIDATION OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person’s account, if we are a party to the proceeding. This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and not by any state law concerning arbitration. In the event the American Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either we or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Service. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of, related to or connected with the use of the Services or these Terms of Services must be filed within one (1) year after such claim of action arose or be forever banned.  
    
2. **Severability**. If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with us.  
    

### 19\. Governing Law and Jurisdiction  

**These Terms of Service shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, including its conflicts of law rules, and the United States of America, and without regard to the Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. You agree that any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of these Terms of Service shall be governed by the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and Federal courts of New York County, New York.  
**

### 20\. Modification

**

### 21\. Miscellaneous

2. **Force Majeure**. We shall not be liable for any failure to perform our obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond our reasonable control, including, without limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation.

Electronic notices should be sent to [help@team.casa](mailto:help@team.casa).    
    
6. **No Waiver**. Our failure to enforce any part of these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of our right to later enforce that or any other part of these Terms of Service. Waiver of compliance in any particular instance does not mean that we will waive compliance in the future. In order for any waiver of compliance with these Terms of Service to be binding, we must provide you with written notice of such waiver through one of our authorized representatives.
