Limitation of liability
-----------------------

University Material is provided on an 'AS IS' and 'AS AVAILABLE' basis. To the extent permitted by law, the University excludes any representations or any warranties (whether express or implied by law), including the implied warranties of satisfactory quality, fitness of a particular purpose, non-infringement, compatibility, security and accuracy.

Unless material is part of University Material, or unless stated otherwise, the site may contain advice, opinions, statements or other information by various authors or organisations. Reliance upon any such advice, opinion, statement or other information is at your risk and to the extent permitted by law the University disclaims all liability and responsibility arising from any reliance placed on such information by any user of the site or by anyone who may be informed of such information.

Where the site contains links to other websites and resources provided by third parties, those links are provided for information only. The University has no control over the contents of those sites or resources and accepts no responsibility for them or for any loss or damage that may arise from your use of them.

In no event shall the University be liable to any party for any of the following losses or damages (whether such losses be foreseen, foreseeable, known or otherwise): loss of data, loss of revenue or anticipated profits, loss of business, loss of opportunity, loss of goodwill or injury to reputation, loss suffered by third parties, any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential loss or damages arising out of use of the site or reliance on any material or services provided in the site or accessed through it, whether or not amended by third parties and regardless of form of action.

General
-------

Nothing in these terms of use is intended to nor shall it confer any benefit on a third party whether under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 or otherwise.

The University's failure or delay to exercise or enforce any right in these terms of use does not waive the University's right to enforce that right.

If any of these terms of use should be determined to be illegal, invalid or otherwise unenforceable by reason of the laws of any country in which these terms of use are intended to be effective, then to the extent and within that jurisdiction in which that term of use is illegal, invalid or unenforceable, it shall be severed and deleted from these terms of use and the remaining terms of use shall survive and remain in full force and effect and continue to be binding and enforceable.
