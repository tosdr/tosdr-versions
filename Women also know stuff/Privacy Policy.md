Cookie Policy

**About this Cookie Policy**

This Cookie Policy is provided as an addition to this site's Privacy Notice and exists to explain what cookies are and how they are used on this site. Cookies are tiny text files that are stored within your web broswer or hard drive when you visit a website or web applicaiton. These cookies allow servers to deliver content tailored to individual users or understand user behavior.

**Types of Cookies we use**

This site employs two first-party cookies (served from us and by us that are essential for the site to operate) and two third-party cookies that deliver external services.

**First-Party Cookies**

We use a server-generated session cookie to remember you when you are logged in to the site. This is essential to making sure that your profile details are those that are updated when you log in to make changes. This also lets us know who is logging into the site and when.

This cookie stores nothing but the word "true" if you have agreed to the terms and is deleted when you close your browser. This cookie's only function is to prevent the cookie notice from popping up every time you refresh the site's homepage.

**Third-Party Cookies**

This site uses Google Analytics to understand usage trends and server performance. We do not store variables which are personally-identifiable in Google Analytics like browser ids or IP addresses. Google's privacy policy can be found [here](https://policies.google.com/privacy). If you would prefer have your browser stop supplying information to Google Analytics, Google provides a [browser extension](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/) to allow you to do so.

This site also uses cookies supplied by Twitter when the Twitter sidebar script is loaded on the homepage. Their cookie policy is available [here](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-cookies). Third-party cookies from Twitter are only loaded on this site's homepage and only when you agree to the terms or click the Twitter logo in the navigation bar.

**How to Disable Cookies Altogether**
