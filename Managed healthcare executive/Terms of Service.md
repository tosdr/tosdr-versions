MJH respects the intellectual property rights of others and expects users of this Website to do so as well. In accordance with the provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) applicable to Internet service providers (17 U.S.C. Section 512), MJH has adopted a policy of terminating, in appropriate circumstances and at our sole discretion, users, members, subscribers, or account holders who are deemed to be repeat infringers. If you believe that your work has been copied and has been posted to this Site in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide MJH’s copyright agent the following written information: (i) an electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright interest; (ii) a description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed upon; (iii) a description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on the Website; (iv) your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an email address; (v) a statement that you have a good-faith belief that the disputed use of the material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (vi) a statement made under penalty of perjury, that the information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf. MJH reserves the right to remove any content posted to the Site at our sole discretion.

17\. Miscellaneous  
If MJH, in its sole discretion, determines that a violation of the Terms has occurred, MJH may pursue any of its legal remedies. However, the failure of MJH to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. In the event that any provision of the Terms is determined to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision shall nonetheless be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and such determination shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any other remaining provisions. The section titles in the Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. These Terms of Use are personal to you and you may not assign these Terms of Use, or your rights or obligations hereunder, to any third party, without our consent. Any attempted assignment without such consent is void. Any provision of these Terms of Use (including all other incorporated terms) that is intended by its terms to survive termination will survive. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this Agreement sets forth the entire agreement between you and MJH regarding its subject matter, and supersedes all prior promises, agreements or representations, whether written or oral as it relates to the Site.
