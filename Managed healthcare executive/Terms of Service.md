Section 512), MJH has adopted a policy of terminating, in appropriate circumstances and at our sole discretion, users, members, subscribers, or account holders who are deemed to be repeat infringers.

In the event that any provision of the Terms is determined to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision shall nonetheless be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and such determination shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any other remaining provisions. The section titles in the Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.
