We also collect information about you when you contact us with an enquiry or to report a problem about our services or our site. This includes when you make an enquiry via our website using the chat function, (we use HubSpot Live Chat). **This is in our legitimate business interests.**

We also collect:

* a record of contacts from any regulators linked to our industry, together with their contact information, in order to comply with a legal obligation; and
* a record of prospective business contacts. This is in our legitimate business interests (i.e. we have a justifiable reason for processing information in this way).
