We need this information as it is necessary to perform our contract with you or the organisation you represent.

We also collect information about you when you contact us with an enquiry or to report a problem about our services or our site. This includes when you make an enquiry via our website using the chat function, (we use HubSpot Live Chat). **This is in our legitimate business interests.**

We also collect:

* a record of contacts from any regulators linked to our industry, together with their contact information, in order to comply with a legal obligation; and
* a record of prospective business contacts. This is in our legitimate business interests (i.e. we have a justifiable reason for processing information in this way).
