**WHAT ARE COOKIES?**

Cookies are small files placed onto your computer or mobile phone by certain websites that you visit or e-mails that you open. They are widely used in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site. 

Cookies can be ‘first party’ or ‘third party’ depending on the domain that sets them. In relation to our website, first party cookies are set by us and information is collected and used by us in accordance with the terms of this Cookie Notice and our online Privacy Notice (https://www.shopiago.com/privacypolicy).

We do not use any third party cookies on our website other than Google Analytics. 

First and third-party cookies are either ‘persistent’ or ‘session’ cookies depending on their duration. Persistent cookies remain on a user's device for the period of time specified in those cookies and are activated each time that user visits the website that created the cookies, until the cookies expire or are disabled by the user. Session cookies allow the actions of a user to be linked during a single browsing session. A session starts when a user opens a browser window, stores information while you are browsing and ends when you leave the website and close the browser window, following which all session cookies are deleted. Our platform uses session and persistent cookies and local storage. We have set out clearly in the table below when our cookies expire.
