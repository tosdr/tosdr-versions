If you activate or update recurring payments through the AliveCor Service, you authorize AliveCor to periodically charge, on a going-forward basis and until cancellation of either the recurring payments or your account, all accrued sums on or before the payment due date for the accrued sums.

5. **License.** AliveCor owns and operates the AliveCor Service. The documents and other information and content available on the AliveCor Service (the “**App Content**“) are protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws throughout the world. All copyright and other proprietary notices on any App Content must be retained on any copies made thereof. Any unauthorized reproduction, modification, distribution, public display or public performance of any App Content is strictly prohibited. AliveCor and its suppliers reserve all rights not granted in these Terms.
    
    Subject to the restrictions set forth in these Terms, AliveCor grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to install and use the App in object code format on devices that you own or control, solely for use with the AliveCor Services. By downloading or using our app(s), you:
    
    1. Acknowledge that the App is licensed, not sold to you; and
        
          
        
    2. Acknowledge that third party terms and fees may apply to the use and operation of your device in connection with your use of the App, such as your carrier’s terms of services, and fees for phone service, data access, or messaging capabilities, and that you are solely responsible for payment of any and all such fees.
        
          
          
        
6. **Telehealth Consultation and Clinician Services.**
    
    Telehealth Services are not provided to NHS Users, or any users outside of the US, this section is therefore not applicable to NHS Users, or any other users based outside of the US.
    
    As part of the Service to US users, included with your KardiaCare membership, KardiaCare+ membership or for an additional fee to Kardia App users in the US, AliveCor may enable you to obtain certain synchronous or live telehealth consultations with a board-certified cardiologist or other provider (each a “**Cardiologist**” or “**Provider**”) licensed in your state of residence through a group of affiliated medical practices:
    
    1. Florida Cardiac Health Medical Group, PA (dba Cardiac Health Medical Group) a Florida professional association (the Lead Entity);
        
          
        
    2. Laura Purdy MD, PC (dba Cardiac Health Medical Group) as California professional corporation;
        
          
        
    3. New Jersey Cardiac Health Medical Group, PA (dba Cardiac Health Medical Group) a New Jersey professional association; and
        
          
        
    4. Kansas Cardiac Health Medical Group, PA a Kansas professional association.
        
          
        
    
    (collectively “**Cardiac Health Medical Group**”) that provide medical services exclusively to our US users and subscribers or an equivalent practice (“**Telehealth Consultation**”). Telehealth involves the delivery of synchronous healthcare services using electronic communications, information technology or other means between the Provider and a patient (you) who are not in the same physical space. While the provision of healthcare services using telehealth may offer certain potential benefits, there are also potential risks associated with the use of telehealth.
    
    Another part of the Service, included with your KardiaCare membership, KardiaCare+ membership or for an additional fee to Kardia App users, may enable you to obtain asynchronous (not live, not in real time) reviews by a Cardiologist for US users or by a certified cardiac technician (“**Cardiac Technician**”) for EEA or UK user of an ECG recording selected by you (“**Clinician Review**”), or selected by AliveCor as part of the Automatic ECG/EKG Reviews service (“Automatic ECG Review”), performed by our affiliated provider Cardiac Health Medical Group or an equivalent practice or by the Cardiac Technician for EEA and UK users. In the Clinician Review or Automatic ECG Review the Cardiologist or Cardiac Technician (as applicable) will review the selected ECG recording selected by you, make appropriate medical findings and diagnoses from the ECG recording, make notes, and generate a report that is provided back to you through Kardia App. Collectively or individually depending on the context of us the Clinician Review and the Telehealth Consultation may be referred to herein as “**Telehealth Services**”. AliveCor does not practice medicine and offers no medical services.
    
      
    
7. **Reports.** You may use the AliveCor Service to generate reports of Instant Analyses from AliveCor’s FDA-cleared and CE-marked algorithms (“**Cleared Algorithms**”) using your data. Any reports from AliveCor’s Cleared Algorithms or from the Telehealth Services serve the same purpose: to provide you more information with which to consult your healthcare professional, not as a substitute to consulting your healthcare professional and do not suggest a diagnosis. These reports are intended as information for you and to be used as a tool by your physician to provide proper diagnosis and treatment, taking into account your complete medical history.
    
      
    
8. **ECG Recordings.** You have the option to obtain an ECG recording from your KardiaMobile Device at any time. Your ECG recordings are subject to multiple factors related to your health and activities. AliveCor and the Clinician Review Service providers make no guarantees of the accuracy or clinical significance of the interpretation of your data. Please be aware that your physician may disagree with the Instant Analysis or interpretation of your data provided by the Cardiologist or Certified Technician. If you decide to use the Clinician Review Service, we will share your information with the Clinician Review Service when you give permission through the AliveCor Service.
    
      
    
9. **Personalized Surveillance Service.** Under some circumstances, AliveCor may present you with notifications or suggested actions based on your historical data and other information you have provided to us such as ‘medications’, ‘symptoms’ or ‘activities’ as part of the Service. Any notifications or suggested actions, or lack thereof, are not an indication of your health, nor are those notifications or suggested actions intended to replace the opinion of your physician. It is your responsibility to present your data to your physician, and to discuss with your physician what the proper course of action is based on your medical history. AliveCor may also allow you to schedule reminder notices using the AliveCor Service, such as reminders to take medication. AliveCor makes no representations about accuracy, reliability, completeness, or timeliness of any push notifications, as parts of the process are outside of AliveCor’s control. You accept that any reliance on these reminders will be at your own risk, and AliveCor disclaims all liability arising from your use of them.
    
    You agree that, subject to applicable laws and only when enabled by you on your mobile device (push notification are disabled by default until enabled by you), AliveCor may send push notifications to your mobile device for AliveCor Service-related or marketing purposes. Marketing notifications will only be sent to you in accordance with our Privacy Policy and the local data protection laws including obtaining explicit and clear consents.

    3. **Limited License Grant to Other Users.** By sharing specific User Content with other (specific) users of the AliveCor Service, or connecting your account to your healthcare provider through our Kardia Pro service, you grant those users and/or healthcare providers a non-exclusive license to access and use that User Content for the purposes of providing you with their professional services (for which you uploaded your User Content and allowed those users to have access to your User Content), as permitted by these Terms and the functionality of the AliveCor Service.
        
        For the avoidance of doubt, no User Content or ECG Data will be provided to, or accessible by, other users of the AliveCor Service if you have not requested, connected, or allowed that user to access your User Content or ECG Data.

        2. your User Content, and the use of your User Content as contemplated by these Terms, does not and will not: (i) infringe, violate, or misappropriate any third-party right, including any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, moral right, privacy right, right of publicity, or any other intellectual property or proprietary right; (ii) slander, defame, libel, or invade the right of privacy, publicity or other property rights of any other person; or (iii) cause AliveCor to violate any law or regulation.

Any use of these third-party services will be governed by the terms of service for those services and not these Terms and we would strongly suggest that you review those terms of service before sharing any of your data with third parties.

    Due to the nature of the NHS Users and the purposes for which the AliveCor Services are provided to the NHS Users, we do not anticipate that such third-party services will be utilised, in which case this section 13 will not be applicable to you as an NHS User. However, if you do decide to use the Kardia App and third party services for purposes outside of the NHS User use, this section 13 will apply.

    NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE ALIVECOR SERVICE OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE ALIVECOR SERVICE WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF THE ALIVECOR ENTITIES OR THE ALIVECOR SERVICE THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS. YOU ASSUME ALL RISK FOR ANY DAMAGE THAT MAY RESULT FROM YOUR USE OF OR ACCESS TO THE ALIVECOR SERVICE, YOUR DEALING WITH ANY OTHER ALIVECOR SERVICE USER, AND ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE ALIVECOR SERVICE. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU USE THE ALIVECOR SERVICE, AND USE, ACCESS, DOWNLOAD, OR OTHERWISE OBTAIN MATERIALS OR CONTENT THROUGH THE ALIVECOR SERVICE AND ANY ASSOCIATED SITES OR SERVICES, AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND THAT YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR PROPERTY (INCLUDING YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR MOBILE DEVICE USED IN CONNECTION WITH THE ALIVECOR SERVICE), OR THE LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE USE OF THE ALIVECOR SERVICE OR THE DOWNLOAD OR USE OF THAT MATERIAL OR CONTENT.
    
    THE ABOVE PARAGRAPHS APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW. SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY PROHIBIT A DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, IN PARTICULAR A DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES PROVIDED OR IMPLIED BY LAW, SUCH AS LEGAL GUARANTEES OF CONFORMITY FOR GOODS OFFERED TO CONSUMERS IN THE EU, AND YOU MAY HAVE OTHER RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.
    
      
    
22. **Limitation of Liability** IN NO EVENT WILL THE ALIVECOR ENTITIES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, OR ANY OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSS) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF, OR YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, THE ALIVECOR SERVICE OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT ON THE ALIVECOR SERVICE, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT ANY ALIVECOR ENTITY HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGE.

Please contact your NHS Healthcare Provider for details of the applicable NHS complaints and dispute procedures.
    
      
    
25. **General.** These Terms, together with the (Privacy Policy)\[[](https://www.alivecor.co.uk/privacy)[https://alivecor.com/privacy](https://alivecor.com/privacy)\] and any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference into these Terms, are the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and AliveCor regarding your use of the AliveCor Service. Except as expressly permitted above, these Terms may be amended only by a written agreement signed by authorized representatives of all parties to these Terms. You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights under these Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent, which may be granted or withheld at AliveCor’s sole discretion. Any attempted assignment by you without such consent shall be null and void. We may assign these Terms at any time without notice or consent, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law. The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of any provision. If any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.

26. **Dispute Resolution and Arbitration for US Users Only**
    
    This section does not apply to users outside of the US, and specifically does not apply to NHS Users
    
    As an NHS User any disputes regarding your use of the AliveCor Service, including any damage to your property or other losses you may suffer as a result of your use of the AliveCor Service, will be resolved between you and your NHS Healthcare Provider in accordance with the applicable NHS complaints procedures. Please contact your NHS Healthcare Provider for further details.
    
    PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRE YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH US AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU MAY SEEK RELIEF FROM US.
    
      
    1. **Generally.** To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law and in the interest of resolving disputes between you (US users only) and AliveCor in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and AliveCor agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration, unless you are a consumer located in a jurisdiction that prohibits the exclusive use of arbitration for dispute resolution.
        
        Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND ALIVECOR ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.
        
          
        
    2. **Opt-Out of Agreement to Arbitrate:** You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by contacting [support@alivecor.com](mailto:support@alivecor.com) within 30 days of first accepting these Terms of Service and stating that you (include your first and last name, and email address used to register for the AliveCor Service) decline this arbitration agreement.
        
          
        
    3. **Exceptions.** Despite the provisions of Section 25A, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.
        
          
        
    4. **Arbitrator.** To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, any arbitration between you and AliveCor will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act, and governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “**AAA Rules**”) of the American Arbitration Association (“**AAA**”), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at ([www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/))\[[https://www.adr.org/](https://www.adr.org/)\], by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting AliveCor.
        
          
        
    5. **Notice; Process.** A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if such other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“**Notice**”). AliveCor’s address for Notice is: AliveCor, Inc., 189 Bernardo Ave., Suite 100 Mountain View, CA 94043 USA. The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“**Demand**”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or AliveCor may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or AliveCor must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, AliveCor will pay you the highest of the following: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by AliveCor in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (iii) $1,000.
        
          
        
    6. Fees. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, AliveCor will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location, to be agreed upon, in Santa Clara County, California, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse AliveCor for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.
        
          
        
    7. **No Class Actions.** TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND ALIVECOR AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and AliveCor agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding, to the fullest extent permissible pursuant to applicable law.
        
          
        
    8. **Claims.** To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, no action arising out of, in connection with, or relating to these Terms shall be brought by you more than one (1) year after the accrual of the cause of action. This period shall not be extended for any reason, except by the written consent of both parties. All statutes or provisions of law which would toll or otherwise affect the running of the period of limitation are hereby waived, and no such statute or provision of law shall operate to extend the period limited in this paragraph, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law.
        
          
        
    9. **Modifications to this Arbitration Provision.** If AliveCor makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to AliveCor’s address for Notice, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to AliveCor’s address for Notice, in which case your account with AliveCor will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.
        
          
        
    10. **Enforceability.** If Section 26G is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 26 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 26 will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 24 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.
        
          
        
27. **Notices; Consent to Electronic Communications.** By using the AliveCor Service, you consent to receiving certain electronic communications from us as further described in the Privacy Policy. Please read the Privacy Notice to learn more about our electronic communications practices. The AliveCor Privacy Notice does not apply to NHS Users, but NHS Users hereby consent to receiving certain electronic communications from us needed to operate and inform you about the Services. You agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that those communications be in writing. All notices from AliveCor intended for receipt by you shall be deemed delivered and effective when sent to the email address provided by you during the registration process or when posted to and made available to you on the AliveCor Service. If you change the email address provided in connection with your registration to access and use the AliveCor Service, you must update your address in accordance with the procedures set forth on the AliveCor Service. By providing your mobile number to us, you consent to receive text messages at that number as requested for account verification, message notifications, and other purposes related to the AliveCor Service. While we do not charge a fee for text messages, your carrier may charge standard messaging, data, and other fees. You are responsible for those charges. We may send and receive text messages through cellular telephone operators or other networks, and the level of reliability may vary. We are not responsible for the timeliness or final delivery of the message, as this is outside our control and is the responsibility of the cellular telephone operator or other networks. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we will use your mobile number in accordance with the Privacy Policy.
