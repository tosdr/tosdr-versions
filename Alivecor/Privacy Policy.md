This Privacy Policy applies to EEA (European Economic Area) Data Subjects unless the Data Subject is using our App or Services under direction from a physician, where the physician and the Data Subject/patient have an agreement between them covering the use of the App or Services. In such a case, the physician’s, or their institution's, privacy policy will apply, not this Privacy Policy. If you are located in the United States or a country outside the EEA or Brazil, your information is stored in the United States, and by using or downloading the Service you agree that your Personal Information, including any information about your health that you provide directly to us or that we collect through your use of the Service, may be transferred to, and stored in, the United States. If you are an EEA or Brazilian user, we store your information in the European Union where all such information is processed in compliance with GDPR.

V. Children's Privacy
---------------------

Our Services are not intended for children under 18 years of age who are not referred and/or under the care of a healthcare professional.

If you are under the age of 18, do not use or provide any information on or in these Services or through any of its features except when referred by, or under the care of, a healthcare professional. If we learn we have collected or received Personal Information from a child under the age of 18 not in compliance with this section, we will delete it.

VI. Does AliveCor respond to Do Not Track signals?
--------------------------------------------------

Some web browsers have a “Do Not Track” feature. This feature lets you tell websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. These features are not yet uniform across browsers. Our Website and App are not currently set up to respond to those signals.

  

---

VII. Data Security
------------------

We have taken steps and implemented administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect against the risk of accidental, intentional, unlawful, or unauthorized access, alteration, destruction, disclosure, or use. The Internet is not 100% secure and we cannot guarantee the security of information transmitted through the Internet. Where you have been given or you have chosen a password, it is your responsibility to keep this password confidential.

  
The sharing and disclosing of information via the Internet is not completely secure. We strive to use best practices and industry standard security measures and tools (e.g., we hold HIPAA, SOC 2 Type 2, ISO 27001, Cyber Essentials, and HITRUST certifications) to protect your data. However, we cannot guarantee the security of Personal Information transmitted to, on, or through our Website(s), App(s), Software, or Services. Any transmission of Personal Information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for the circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on our Website(s), App(s), Software, Device(s), or Services in your operating system or mobile device.

X. European Economic Activity Zone Users
----------------------------------------

AliveCor is the Data Controller of the Personal Information you provide on the Services. However, in some cases, this Privacy Policy may not apply to all European Economic Activity (“EEA”) users. This Privacy Policy does not apply to EEA users using the Services under the direction of a physician, where the physician and the patient have an agreement between them covering the use of the Services. In such a case, the physician or his/her institution controls the data collected by the Device and App, and the physician's or his/her institution's privacy policy will apply, not this Privacy Policy. If you are an EEA user, your Personal Information is stored within the EEA.

AliveCor has appointed a Data Protection Officer (Bill Jacobs) in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulations. AliveCor and its subsidiary, AliveCor, LTD, and its Data Protection Officer may be contacted in any manner set forth below in Contact Us.

###   

### Consent to Processing of Personal Information.

We rely on your consent as a lawful basis to process your Personal Information for the following purposes:

* Initial collection of Personal Information through the Services, and
    
* To provide you with marketing or promotional communications. You may opt-out of such communications at any time by clicking the “unsubscribe” link found within the AliveCor email updates and changing your contact preferences.
    

We also process Personal Information based on our **contractual obligations** to provide you the Services as described in [How do we share your Personal Information?](#how-do-we-use-your-personal-information), including:

* To enable the Service to function as expected.
    
* To communicate with you in response to customer services inquiries, to deliver non-promotional, service-related emails, or to administer surveys and questionnaires.
    
* To tailor your experience based on your general region. For example, we process clinician review requests from EEA-based users through an EEA-based clinician review partner.
    

AliveCor may also process Personal Information pursuant to a legal obligation or to protect your vital interests or those of another person.

We will process your Personal Information as necessary for our legitimate interests. Our legitimate interests are balanced against your rights and freedoms and we do not process your Personal Information if your rights and freedoms outweigh our legitimate interests. Our legitimate interests are to: facilitate communication between you and AliveCor; detect and correct bugs and to improve our Services; safeguard our IT infrastructure and intellectual property; detect and prevent fraud and other crime; and develop our product and services.

###   

### What rights do I have?

Individuals located in the EEA have certain rights with respect to their Personal Information. These rights include:

* **Access and Update**. You can review and change your Personal Information by notifying us through the [Contact Information](#xii-contact-us) below of any changes or errors in any Personal Information we have about you to ensure that it is complete, accurate, and as current as possible. We may not be able to accommodate your request if we believe it would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect.
    
* **Restrictions**. You have the right to restrict our processing of your Personal Information under certain circumstances. In particular, you can request we restrict our use of it if you contest its accuracy, if the processing of your Personal Information is determined to be unlawful, or if we no longer need your Personal Information for processing but we have retained it as permitted by law.
    
* **Portability**. To the extent the Personal Information you provide AliveCor is processed based on your consent or that we process it through automated means, you have the right to request that we provide you a copy of, or access to, all or part of such Personal Information in structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. You also have the right to request that we transmit this Personal Information to another controller, when technically feasible.
    
* **Withdrawal of Consent**. To the extent that our processing of your Personal Information is based on your consent, you may withdraw your consent at any time by closing your account. Withdrawing your consent will not, however, affect the lawfulness of the processing based on your consent before its withdrawal, and will not affect the lawfulness of our continued processing that is based on any other lawful basis for processing your Personal Information.
    
* **Right to be Forgotten**. You have the right to request that we delete all of your Personal Information. We cannot delete your Personal Information except by also deleting your user account, and we will only delete your account when we no longer have a lawful basis for processing your Personal Information or after a final determination that your Personal Information was unlawfully processed. We may not accommodate a request to erase information if we believe the deletion would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect. In all other cases, we will retain your Personal Information as set forth in this policy. In addition, we cannot completely delete your Personal Information as some data may rest in previous backups. These will be retained for the periods set forth in our disaster recovery policies.
    
* **Complaints**. You have the right to lodge a complaint with the applicable supervisory authority in the country you live in, the country you work in, or the country where you believe your rights under applicable data protection laws have been violated. However, before doing so, we request that you contact us directly in order to give us an opportunity to work directly with you to resolve any concerns about your privacy.
    
* **How You May Exercise Your Rights**. You may exercise any of the above rights by contacting us through any of the methods listed under Contact Us below. If you contact us to exercise any of the foregoing rights, we may ask you for additional information to verify your identity. We reserve the right to limit or deny your request if you have failed to provide sufficient information to verify your identity or to satisfy our legal and business requirements. Please note that if you make unfounded, repetitive, or excessive requests (as determined in our reasonable discretion) to access your Personal Information, you may be charged a fee subject to a maximum set by applicable law.
    

###   

### Automated Decision Making.

Our processing of Personal Information may include automated decision making, including profiling, which may produce a legal effect concerning you or similarly significantly affect you. The algorithms used for our automated decision making process classifies and categorizes your health based on data collected by the Devices and Personal Information collected by the Services.
