BevMo! Terms:

Bevmo! operates specialty beverage stores in California, Arizona and Washington in addition to the Bevmo! Site and App. Laws regarding the sale and transportation of alcoholic beverages are complex and constantly changing. The politics, policies and procedures regarding such sales and transportation are different in every state. That being said, title to the alcoholic beverages passes to you upon purchase in either California, Arizona or Washington. In the event that BevMo! may ship wine or other alcoholic beverages to your state in accordance with a state privilege requiring the payment of state taxes, you will be charged the state taxes (including the sales tax), if any, assessed by your state for that transaction; otherwise either California, Arizona or Washington sales tax will be assessed on the sale. Title to all product intended for shipment to federal property and Indian reservations passes to the customer when the goods are picked up by the common carrier, and California sales tax will be collected on all such purchases. When your order is approved by your credit card company, you own the goods. If you choose shipping as a delivery method, you are asking us to engage a common carrier to deliver your order to you. We make no representations about the legality of shipping alcoholic beverages. Our Site lists those states where common carriers will deliver alcohol. You are responsible for compliance with all laws regarding such shipments. Please note that customers in Washington or Arizona who place orders of alcoholic beverages for shipment within the state will have their orders fulfilled from one of our in-state retail locations and will be charged state tax accordingly.

By arranging for transportation of the alcoholic beverages, BevMo! is providing a service to, and acting on behalf of you. By utilizing this service from BevMo! you are representing that you are acting in compliance with your local and state laws regarding the purchase, transportation and delivery of alcoholic beverages. You further represent that you have obtained any required permission, paid any required fees, are working through properly licensed intermediaries where required, are legally entitled to take possession of the alcoholic beverages, are legally entitled to take quantities ordered and that you and the person accepting delivery of the alcoholic beverage products are at least 21 years of age. If, between the date of order and date of arrival, the laws of your state change so as to make it illegal for you to import your shipment, you may return the order for a full refund.  If your purchase is spoiled, contaminated or otherwise not consumable you may return the product within seven (7) days with a valid receipt for a refund to the original form of payment or, if you prefer, exchange the product.

All returns must be made in accordance with California, Arizona, and/or Washington law and returns across state lines are normally not permitted. In the event of a return from across a state line please contact customer service to make a claim for a refund.

There are two ways to get your product from BevMo.com:

a.    You can pick up your products at our stores; or,

b.    You can ship your products to yourself or another recipient via common carrier. Any recipient of alcoholic beverages must provide proof of age (over 21 years of age)

All orders are shipped out Monday through Friday according to the following schedule:

•   All Orders placed before 4:00 pm (Pacific Standard Time) Monday through Friday will be shipped out the following business day

•   Orders placed on the weekends and major Holidays will be shipped out the next business day

•   Overnight and 2nd Day Air: Orders placed before 9:00 pm (Pacific Standard Time) are shipped the following day. Therefore, if you choose Next Day Air it will leave our shipping facility the following day and arrive at its destination the next day.

•   We reserve the right to hold shipments if we believe weather conditions (extreme heat or freezing cold) may impact the quality of our product.

•   If you have particular requests, please note those in the “Special Instructions” box.

Identification will be required for pickup, shipping, and delivery, as follows:

When picking up your product at our stores, you must positively identify yourself as the person who placed the order on the Website.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION – Mutual Arbitration, No Class Actions; PLEASE READ. ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SERVICES WILL BE RESOLVED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS BY FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION, RATHER THAN IN COURT, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. HOWEVER, AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A COURT (INCLUDING INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF OR STATUTORY DAMAGES), AND MUST FOLLOW THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT AS A COURT WOULD.

Except as otherwise stated in this Arbitration provision, any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, including any question regarding its breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity, or Services, shall be finally settled by arbitration.  This Arbitration Provision shall apply, without limitation, to all claims that arose or were asserted before the effective date of this Agreement or any prior version of this Agreement. This Arbitration Provision is exclusively governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1–16) (“FAA”), and evidences a transaction involving commerce. The Parties further agree that the FAA shall exclusively govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Provision, and that the FAA shall apply to any and all claims arising out of or relating to the Agreement.  Such claims include, but are in no way limited to, claims relating to the scope, enforceability, validity, interpretation of, enforcement of, or conscionability of this Arbitration Provision.  Such claims also include, but are in no way limited to, breach of contract, consumer and data protection, and other claims arising under federal, state, or local statutory, and/or common law. If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the FAA does not apply (it being the Parties’ intent that it will apply), then, and only in that event, will the law of arbitration of the State You last utilized Services apply.  In the event any portion of this Arbitration Provision is deemed unenforceable, it shall be severed from the Arbitration Provision such that the remainder of this Arbitration Provision shall be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.  Regardless of any other terms of this Arbitration Provision or the Agreement, nothing prevents You from making a report to or filing a claim or charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, U.S. Department of Labor, Securities Exchange Commission, National Labor Relations Board, or Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs.  Nothing in this Arbitration Provision or the Agreement prevents the investigation by a government agency of any report, claim or charge otherwise covered by this Arbitration Provision.  This Arbitration Provision does not cover disputes that, as a matter of law, may not be subject to pre-dispute arbitration agreements.  And nothing in this Arbitration Provision or the Agreement prevents You from notifying any state agency, other public prosecutor, law enforcement agency, or any other governmental entity of any alleged violation of law.  To the extent the Parties have both arbitrable and non-arbitrable disputes that are related, the arbitrable disputes shall proceed first in arbitration and the non-arbitrable disputes shall be stayed, and any applicable statutes of limitations tolled, pending completion of the arbitration.

If you do not want to arbitrate disputes with Gopuff and you are an individual, you may opt out of this arbitration agreement by sending an email to legal@gopuff.com within 30 days of the earlier of the day you first access or use the Apps and the day you first receive any of the Services. Before commencing individual arbitration the Parties must engage in a good-faith effort to resolve any claim covered by this Arbitration provision through an informal telephonic dispute resolution conference between the Parties. The informal telephonic dispute resolution conferences shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either Party intends to commence individual arbitration; multiple users or former multiple users initiating claims may not participate in the same informal telephonic dispute resolution conference. If either Party is represented by counsel, that Party’s counsel may participate in the informal telephonic dispute resolution conference, but the Party must also appear at and participate in the conference. The Party initiating the claim must first send a written notice to Gopuff of its intent to arbitrate (“Notice”).. The Notice to Gopuff should be sent by any of the following means: (i) electronic mail to [legal@gopuff.com](mailto:legal@gopuff.com); or (ii) sending the Notice by U.S. Postal Service certified mail to our registered agent Corporation Service Company, 2711 Centreville Road, Suite 400, Wilmington, DE 19808. The Notice must (x) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (y) set forth the specific relief sought. If we do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim informally within 30 days after the notice is received, or longer if an extension is mutually agreed upon by the Parties, you or Gopuff may commence an arbitration proceeding. Engaging in an informal telephonic dispute resolution conference is a condition precedent that must be fulfilled before commencing individual arbitration. If either Party disputes whether this condition precedent has been satisfied, such dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by any arbitrator. Statutes of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the Parties engage in the informal dispute resolution process required by this paragraph.

Only after the Parties have engaged in a good-faith effort to resolve the dispute through an informal telephonic dispute resolution conference, and only if this informal telephonic dispute conference fails to fully resolve the dispute, then either Party may initiate arbitration by notifying the other Party in writing via certified mail, return receipt requested, or hand delivery within the applicable statute of limitations period. This demand for arbitration must include (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, and e-mail address of the Party seeking arbitration (if You are seeking arbitration, the e-mail address provided must be the e-mail address associated with your user account); (2) a statement of the specific legal claims being asserted and factual bases of those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good faith calculation of the amount in controversy; and (4) the original personal signature of the Party seeking arbitration (a digital, electronic, copied, or facsimile signature is not sufficient).  If the Party is represented by counsel, counsel must also provide an original personal signature on the demand for arbitration (a digital, electronic, copied, or facsimile signature is not sufficient).  By signing the demand for arbitration, counsel certifies to the best of counsel’s knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, that (1) the demand for arbitration is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; (2) the claims and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; and (3) the factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.  Any demand for arbitration by You must be delivered to Gopuff’s registered agent at registered agent Corporation Service Company, 2711 Centreville Road, Suite 400, Wilmington, DE 19808.  If one law firm represents multiple parties concurrently demanding arbitration of related or similar allegations, each arbitration shall be heard by a different Arbitrator and assigned to a different case manager.

The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its rules as modified by this Agreement, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA’s rules are available at [www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org/) or by calling 1-800-778-7879. The number of arbitrators shall be one. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this arbitration clause, but the arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules. We will reimburse all AAA filing, administration and arbitrator fees paid by you for claims totaling less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator determines that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought is improper or not warranted, as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), in which case the payment of all such fees shall be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse Gopuff for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Gopuff will not seek attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claim or the relief sought is improper or not warranted. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, enforceability, or formation of this arbitration agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this arbitration agreement is void or voidable. However, the preceding sentence shall not apply to the paragraph below. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWABLE BY LAW, ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CURRENT OR FORMER USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CURRENT OR FORMER USER OR OTHER ENTITY. To the maximum extent allowable by law, the Parties mutually agree that by entering into this Arbitration Provision, both Parties waive their right to have any dispute or claim brought, heard, or arbitrated as a class, collective, coordinated, and/or mass action, whether in court or in arbitration, and an arbitrator shall not have any authority to hear or arbitrate any class, collective, coordinated, and/or mass action or to award relief to anyone but the individual in arbitration (“Class Action Waiver”).  The Parties agree that the definition of a “class, collective, coordinated, and/or mass action” includes, but is not limited to, instances in which You are represented by a law firm or collection of law firms that has filed more than 25 arbitration demands of a substantially similar nature against Gopuff within 180 days of the arbitration demand filed on Your behalf, and the law firm or collective of law firms seeks to simultaneously or collectively administer and/or arbitrate all the arbitration demands together.  If more than 25 arbitration demands of a substantially similar nature are filed against Gopuff by the same law firm or collection of law firms within 180 days of one another, each arbitration demand must be filed, administered, arbitrated, and resolved in an individual manner.  This Class Action Wavier does not prevent You or Gopuff from participating in a classwide settlement of claims.  Notwithstanding any other clause contained in this Arbitration Provision or the Agreement, any claim in court or arbitration that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, voidable, or has been breached, shall be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator.  In any case in which (1) the dispute is filed as a class, collective, coordinated, and/or mass action and (2) there is a final judicial determination that all or part of the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, the class, collective, coordinated, and/or mass action to that extent must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, but the portion of the Class Action Waiver that remains enforceable shall be enforced in arbitration. Gopuff may lawfully seek enforcement of this Arbitration Provision and the Class Action Waiver and seek dismissal of such class, collective, coordinated, and/or mass actions or claims.  The Class Action Waiver shall be severable in any case in which the severance is necessary to ensure that the individual action proceeds in arbitration.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, we also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court for temporary or preliminary injunctive relief, including to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.

If any provision hereof is or becomes, at any time or for any reason, unenforceable or invalid, no other provision hereof will be affected thereby and the remaining provisions will continue with the same effect as if such unenforceable or invalid provisions will not have been inserted herein; provided that the ability of either party to obtain substantially the bargained-for performance of the other will not have thereby been impaired. It is expressly understood that in the event either party on any occasion fails to perform any term hereof and the other party does not enforce that term, the failure to enforce on any occasion will not constitute a waiver of any term and will not prevent enforcement on any other occasion. Nothing contained in this Agreement will be deemed to constitute either party as the agent or representative of the other party or both parties as joint venturers or partners for any purpose. In the event that either party is prevented from performing, or is unable to perform, any of its obligations under this Agreement due to any cause beyond the reasonable control of the party invoking this provision, the affected party’s performance will be extended for the period of delay or inability to perform due to such occurrence. The headings and captions contained herein will not be considered to be part of this Agreement but are for convenience only.

FAM SUBSCRIPTION TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Fam Subscription Program. The Fam Subscription Program, including Student FAM (collectively, “Fam”) is offered as a monthly or yearly subscription that provides (i) free deliveries (no additional delivery fee) on orders, subject to a minimum order amount, placed through the Services (“Free Deliveries”) and (ii) other benefits or offers as may be specified by Gopuff from time-to-time. By signing up for Fam and providing us with your payment account information, you expressly acknowledge and agree that you are signing up to an auto-renewing subscription requiring recurring payments and agree to pay the then-current applicable fee associated with the Fam subscription.

Subscription Term. If you sign up for the monthly Fam subscription, you will be charged your first monthly subscription fee and any applicable taxes, including sales tax, on or about  the date you purchase your subscription or, if your subscription includes a free trial, on or about the day after your free trial ends. Your subscription will automatically continue on a monthly basis, and you will continue to be charged on a monthly basis at the then-current price (including any applicable taxes, which may include sales tax), until you cancel your subscription as described herein or we terminate it. If you sign up for the yearly subscription, you will be charged your first upfront, non-refundable (except as described below) yearly subscription fee and any applicable taxes including sales tax, on or about  the date you purchase your subscription or, if your subscription includes a free trial, on or about the day after your free trial ends. Your subscription will automatically continue on a yearly basis at the then-current price (including any applicable taxes which may include sales tax), and you will continue to be charged on a yearly basis, until you cancel your subscription as described herein or we terminate it. You may cancel your subscription at any time through “Manage Subscription” in your Gopuff account settings. You must cancel your subscription before it renews to avoid billing of the next periodic subscription fees to your account. However, if you cancel a pre-paid yearly or monthly subscription, you will not receive any refund. If you cancel your monthly or yearly subscription, you will be able to use your Fam subscription for the remainder of your pre-paid subscription term.

If your Fam subscription includes a free trial, you will not be charged the applicable fee during your free trial. To obtain the free trial you may be required to provide a credit card in order to ensure uninterrupted access to Fam and continued use after the expiration of the free trial. Upon completion of your free trial, your subscription will automatically convert into a paid Fam subscription and your payment method will be charged the applicable fee and any applicable taxes (including sales tax) unless you have canceled your Fam subscription. You may cancel your Fam subscription as described above. You may not receive a notice from us that your free trial has ended or that the paying portion of your Fam subscription has begun.

If your payment details change, your card provider may provide us with updated card details. We may use these new details in order to help prevent any interruption to your Fam subscription. If you would like to use a different payment method or if there is a change in payment method, please update your billing information in the app. You authorize us to charge any payment method associated with your account in case your primary payment method is declined or no longer available to us for payment of your membership fee. We may cancel your Fam subscription with or without notice if your payment method is invalid for any reason.

We may change the Fam subscription terms or fees at any time, without notice on a going forward basis at our discretion. If the pricing for your subscription increases, we will notify you prior to the increase, and provide you an opportunity to change your subscription or cancel your subscription before applying those changes to your account or charging your payment details in connection with an automatic renewal. The notification will inform you of how long you have to change or cancel your subscription before the changes become effective. Your continued use of Fam after the changes become effective will constitute your acceptance of the changes. If you do not wish to continue subscribing with the new fees or features, you may cancel your subscription. If you do not change or cancel the new subscription, its terms and conditions will apply for that renewal and all renewals going forward.

We may terminate your subscription for Fam at our discretion and without any notice. If we cancel your yearly subscription for Fam, we will give you a prorated refund based on the amount of time remaining in your pre-paid subscription; provided, however, that Gopuff will not be obligated to provide you a refund if we terminate your Gopuff account or your Fam subscription because we determine, in our sole discretion, that your actions or your use of the Fam or the Services violates these Terms or has harmed another user.
