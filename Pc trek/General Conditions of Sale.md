###### REFUND POLICY

Please review our refund policy before purchasing any of PC Trek's software products.

PC Trek provides detailed descriptions of its software, and it is assumed that the buyer has reviewed the information available for the chosen software. With this in mind, no refund/return request should be solicited by the buyer on such basis. All software is non-refundable. PC Trek guarantees the quality of all the software products listed on this website. Therefore, if your product is defective in any way, we will replace it with another version of the same software, at no extra charge.

Under such circumstances, we will also consider return/refund requests on defective software. Please send a return/refund request along with your reason for the request to returns@pctrek.com. A reply will be sent to you after it has been determined if a return/refund is necessary. If it is determined that your product is defective and you wish to return the software, you must relinquish ownership of your license to qualify for a refund.
