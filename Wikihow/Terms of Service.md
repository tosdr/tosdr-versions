====================

At wikiHow, our mission is to empower every person on the planet to learn how to do anything. We do this by collaborating to create the world’s most helpful instructions. Before you read our detailed, legally binding Terms of Use, here is a non-legalese summary of some key information about reading or contributing to wikiHow:

1. You continue to own the copyrights of the content you submit to wikiHow. That said, by posting your content on wikiHow you give us multiple rights to use and change it (see “User Content License Grants” below for details).

3. We license all user generated content text on wikiHow under a Creative Commons license. Read more [here](https://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Creative-Commons "wikiHow:Creative Commons"). If you want to republish wikiHow content under the terms of this license please follow [our attribution guidelines](https://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Attribution "wikiHow:Attribution").

Introduction
--------------

Welcome to wikiHow, the website, mobile, and online services of wikiHow, Inc. (“wikiHow,” “we,” or “us”). This page explains the terms by which you may use our online and/or mobile services, website, media (including but not limited to text, videos, voiceovers, scripts, and other content created by wikiHow) anywhere on the internet (including but not limited to YouTube and social media platforms), and software provided on or in connection with the service (collectively the “Service”). By accessing or using the Service, you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Terms of Use Agreement (“Agreement”) and to the collection and use of your information as set forth in the [wikiHow Privacy Policy](https://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Privacy-Policy "wikiHow:Privacy Policy"), whether or not you are a registered user of our Service. This Agreement applies to all visitors, users, and others who access the Service (“Users”).

  
PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND EACH PROVISION. THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A MANDATORY ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES PROVISION THAT REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS.

  

Use of Our Service
--------------------

wikiHow provides a place for users to learn how to do things and to share how-to knowledge with others. Our goal is to create the world’s most helpful instructions, thus empowering every person on the planet to learn how to do anything. We appreciate your valuable contributions to the Service.

A. Eligibility.

You may use the Service only if you can form a binding contract with wikiHow, and only in compliance with this Agreement and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules, and regulations. The Service is not available to any Users previously removed from the Service by wikiHow. By accepting these Terms, you certify that you are either (i) 16 years of age or older or (ii) you are at least 13 years of age and are using the services with parental consent and under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian who has agreed to be bound by these Terms on your behalf. Any use of the Service by anyone under 13 is strictly prohibited and in violation of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a child under the age of 13 may use the site if we receive a signed permission form from the child’s parent or legal guardian. The permission form can be found [here](https://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:COPPA-Parental-Permission-Form "wikiHow:COPPA Parental Permission Form").

B. wikiHow Service.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you are hereby granted a non-exclusive, limited, non-transferable, freely revocable license to use the Service as permitted by the features of the Service. wikiHow may terminate this license at any time for any reason or no reason. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, wikiHow further grants to each User of the Service, a license to use the user generated text of articles found on the Service in accordance with our [Creative Commons License](https://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Creative-Commons "wikiHow:Creative Commons"). Under this license, you may freely use, copy, and distribute such text for personal, non-commercial purposes so long as you follow [our attribution requirements](https://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Attribution "wikiHow:Attribution"). Please carefully read the full terms and conditions [here](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/). wikiHow reserves all rights not expressly granted herein in the Service and the wikiHow Content (as defined below).

C. wikiHow Accounts.

Your wikiHow account gives you access to the services and functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion. If you open a wikiHow account on behalf of a company, organization, or other entity, then (a) “you” includes you and that entity, and (b) you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the entity with the authority to bind the entity to this Agreement, and that you agree to this Agreement on the entity’s behalf. By connecting to wikiHow with a third-party service, you give us permission to access and use your information from that service as permitted by that service, and to store your log-in credentials for that service.

You may never use another User’s account without permission. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure. We encourage you to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your account. You must notify wikiHow immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account. wikiHow will not be liable for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account.

You may control your User profile and how you interact with the Service by changing the settings in your [Preferences](https://www.wikihow.com/Special:Preferences "Special:Preferences"). By providing wikiHow your email address you consent to our using the email address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. We may also use your email address to send you other messages, such as changes to features of the Service and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you may opt out or change your preferences in your [Preferences](https://www.wikihow.com/Special:Preferences "Special:Preferences"). Opting out may prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers.

D. Service Rules.

You agree not to engage in any of the following prohibited activities: (i) transmitting spam, chain letters, or other unsolicited email; (ii) attempting to interfere with, compromise the system integrity or security or decipher any transmissions to or from the servers running the Service; (iii) taking any action that imposes, or may impose at our sole discretion an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure; (iv) uploading invalid data, viruses, worms, or other software agents through the Service; (v) collecting or harvesting any personally identifiable information, including account names from the Service; (vii) impersonating another person or otherwise misrepresenting your affiliation with a person or entity, conducting fraud; (viii) interfering with the proper working of the Service; (ix) accessing any content on the Service through any technology or means other than those provided or authorized by the Service; (x) using or scraping the content or data on the Service to train machine learning or to use in artificial intelligence models without express written permission from wikiHow; or (xi) bypassing the measures we may use to prevent or restrict access to the Service, including without limitation features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content or enforce limitations on use of the Service or the content therein.

If you operate a search engine or robot, or if you republish a significant fraction of all wikiHow Content (as we may determine in our reasonable discretion), you must follow these rules:

* You must use a descriptive user agent header;
* You must provide prominent attribution to wikiHow;
* You must follow robots.txt at all times; and
* You must make it clear how to contact you, either in your user agent string, or on your website if you have one.

We may, without prior notice, change the Service; stop providing the Service or features of the Service, to you or to users generally; or create usage limits for the Service. We may permanently or temporarily terminate or suspend your access to the Service without notice and liability for any reason, including if in our sole determination you violate any provision of this Agreement, or for no reason. Upon termination for any reason or no reason, you continue to be bound by this Agreement.

You are solely responsible for your interactions with other wikiHow Users. We reserve the right but have no obligation to monitor disputes between you and other Users. wikiHow shall have no liability for your interactions with other Users, or for any User’s action or inaction.

Trusted Users
---------------

wikiHow may provide certain Users with administrative privileges in order to monitor or provide certain aspects of the Service (“Trusted Users”). These privileges may include, without limitation, the ability to remove User Content provided by other Users or monitor other Users’ use of the Service. For the avoidance of doubt, wikiHow Trusted Users include, but are not limited to, “Admins” (aka SysOps or Administrators) and “New Article Boosters”. You acknowledge that wikiHow may revoke your status as a Trusted User at any time for any reason or no reason, and may require you to enter into further agreements with wikiHow depending on your role.

If you are a Trusted User, you acknowledge that you may have access to the personal information of other Users, and you represent and warrant that you will handle that information in accordance with the wikiHow [Privacy Policy](https://www.wikihow.com/wikiHow:Privacy-Policy "wikiHow:Privacy Policy") and the confidentiality obligations contained herein. You further acknowledge that you may have access to wikiHow Confidential Information (as defined below), and you represent and warrant, at all times you are serving as a Trusted User and thereafter, to hold in strictest confidence, and not to use, except for the benefit of wikiHow to the extent necessary to perform authorized services on behalf of wikiHow, and not to disclose to any person, firm, corporation or other entity, without written authorization from wikiHow in each instance, any wikiHow Confidential Information that you obtain from wikiHow or otherwise obtain, access or create in connection with, or as a result of, your relationship with wikiHow or your performance of any services as a Trusted User, until such wikiHow Confidential Information becomes publicly and widely known and made generally available through no wrongful act of you or of others who were under confidentiality obligations as to the item or items involved. You further agree not to make copies of such wikiHow Confidential Information, except as expressly authorized by wikiHow and to return to wikiHow or delete any copies or materials containing wikiHow Confidential Information upon wikiHow’s request.

You understand that “wikiHow Confidential Information” means information and physical material not generally known or available outside wikiHow, and information and physical material entrusted to wikiHow in confidence by third parties. wikiHow Confidential Information includes, without limitation: technical data, analytical data, User Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, any personal information relating to Users, software codes and designs, algorithms, non-public business information, and any other non-public information to which you gain access while serving as a Trusted User.

User Content
--------------

The Service allows Users to post content such as profile information, instructional and informational materials, photographs, images, comments, questions, and other content or information (any such materials a User submits, posts, displays, or otherwise makes available on the Service “User Content”). Unless governed by other, case-specific terms provided to you, the User Content you create remains yours; however, by sharing User Content through the Service, you agree to allow others to view, edit, and/or share your User Content in accordance with this Agreement (see “User Content License Grants” below). wikiHow has the right (but not the obligation) in its sole discretion to remove any User Content that is shared via the Service.

You agree not to post User Content that: (i) may create a risk of harm, loss, physical or mental injury, emotional distress, death, disability, disfigurement, or physical or mental illness to you, to any other person, or to any animal; (ii) may create a risk of any other loss or damage to any person or property; (iii) seeks to harm or exploit children by exposing them to inappropriate content, asking for personally identifiable details or otherwise; (iv) may constitute or contribute to a crime or tort; (v) contains any information or content that we deem to be unlawful, harmful, abusive, racially or ethnically offensive, defamatory, infringing, invasive of personal privacy or publicity rights, harassing, humiliating to other people (publicly or otherwise), libelous, threatening, profane, obscene, or otherwise objectionable; (vi) contains any information or content that is illegal (including, without limitation, the disclosure of insider information under securities law or of another party’s trade secrets); (vii) contains any information or content that you do not have a right to make available under any law or under contractual or fiduciary relationships; or (viii) contains any information or content that you know is not correct and current. You agree that any User Content that you post does not and will not violate third-party rights of any kind, including without limitation any Intellectual Property Rights (as defined below) or rights of privacy. wikiHow reserves the right, but is not obligated, to reject and/or remove any User Content that wikiHow believes, in its sole discretion, violates these provisions or is otherwise inappropriate for the Service. You understand that publishing your User Content on the Service is not a substitute for registering it with the U.S. Copyright Office, the Writer’s Guild of America, or any other rights organization.

For the purposes of this Agreement, “Intellectual Property Rights” means all patent rights, copyright rights, mask work rights, moral rights, rights of publicity, trademark, trade dress and service mark rights, goodwill, trade secret rights and other intellectual property rights as may now exist or hereafter come into existence, and all applications therefore and registrations, renewals and extensions thereof, under the laws of any state, country, territory, or other jurisdiction.

In connection with your User Content, you affirm, represent, and warrant the following:

A. You have the written consent of each and every identifiable natural person in the User Content to use such person’s name or likeness in the manner contemplated by the Service and this Agreement, and each such person has released you from any liability that may arise in relation to such use.

B. Your User Content and wikiHow’s use thereof as contemplated by this Agreement and the Service will not violate any law or infringe any rights of any third party, including but not limited to any Intellectual Property Rights and privacy rights.

C. wikiHow may exercise the rights to your User Content granted under this Agreement without liability for payment of any guild fees, residuals, payments, fees, or royalties payable under any collective bargaining agreement or otherwise.

D. To the best of your knowledge, all of your User Content and other information that you provide to us is truthful and accurate.

wikiHow takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User Content that you or any other User or third party posts or sends over the Service. You shall be solely responsible for your User Content and the consequences of posting or publishing it, and you agree that we are only acting as a passive conduit for your online distribution and publication of your User Content. You understand and agree that you may be exposed to User Content that is inaccurate, objectionable, inappropriate for children, or otherwise unsuited to your purpose, and you agree that wikiHow shall not be liable for any damages you allege to incur as a result of User Content.

User Content License Grants
-----------------------------

A. License Grant to wikiHow.

By posting any User Content on the Service, you expressly grant, represent, and warrant that you have all rights necessary to grant to wikiHow a royalty-free, sublicensable, assignable, transferable, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide license to use, reproduce, modify, publish, list information regarding, edit, sell, monetize, translate, distribute, syndicate, publicly perform, publicly display, and make derivative works of all such User Content and your name, voice, and/or likeness as contained in your User Content, in whole or in part, and in any form, media or technology, whether now known or hereafter developed, for use in connection with the Service and wikiHow’s (and its successors’ and affiliates’) business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Service (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels.

B. License Grants to Users

  
(1) Text Content. All text posted by Users to the Service is sub-licensed by wikiHow to other Users under a Creative Commons license as provided herein. The Creative Commons license allows such user generated text content to be used freely for personal, non-commercial purposes, so long as it is used and attributed to the original author as specified under the terms of the license. wikiHow hereby grants each User of the Service a license to all text content that Users contribute to the Service under the terms and conditions of a Creative Commons [CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/). Please be sure to read the terms of the license carefully.

(2) Image Content. When you upload images to the Service, you may select among various licenses under which wikiHow may distribute and sublicense your image-based User Content. wikiHow hereby grants to Users of the Service all rights specified under the terms of the license under which any image-based User Content is licensed to wikiHow.

Third Party Content: YouTube Videos
-------------------------------------

Certain wikiHow pages contain third party content in the form of embedded videos from the YouTube API Service. Your use of these videos is governed by YouTube's Terms of Service, which you may read in full at [YouTube Terms of Service](https://www.youtube.com/t/terms).

wikiHow Pro
-------------

A. wikiHow Pro General Terms

We may offer a paid subscription that provides access to certain premium features within the Service ("wikiHow Pro"). wikiHow Pro is still governed by the general provisions of this Agreement with additional special terms as defined in this section. wikiHow Pro may be available through annual, monthly, and lifetime (see "Lifetime Subscription Terms" below for more details) subscription plans. Fees are billed automatically on a recurring basis and you agree to pay all charges at the prices then in effect for your chosen subscription plan.

You may cancel your subscription by contacting [support@wikihow.pro](mailto:support@wikihow.pro) at any time. Cancellations will take effect at the end of the current billing cycle. wikiHow reserves the right to terminate or suspend your subscription at any time. If we terminate your subscription, we may provide a prorated refund for the remaining period of your subscription.

wikiHow reserves the right to discontinue the wikiHow Pro service, as well as to add, remove, or modify features and content of the wikiHow Pro service at any time. wikiHow makes no claims or guarantees related to the exclusive nature of the wikiHow Pro offerings. Certain features or content may be made available to non-subscribers.

The wikiHow Pro service is intended for personal, non-commercial use only. The free PDF download feature of the wikiHow Pro subscription is not unlimited, and excessive downloads of PDFs or abuse of this feature, defined at wikiHow's sole discretion, may result in the termination of your subscription.

B. Lifetime Subscription Terms

The term “Lifetime Subscription” refers to the duration of the wikiHow Pro service as long as it is provided by wikiHow. This does not guarantee that the service will be available for the actual lifetime of the subscriber. wikiHow reserves the right to discontinue the wikiHow Pro service at any time at its discretion. In the event of such discontinuation, Lifetime Subscriptions will terminate with no obligation or refunds due to the subscriber. wikiHow does not make any guarantee about the uninterrupted continuation of the wikiHow Pro service and wikiHow shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from the use or inability to use the wikiHow Pro service.

If you choose to cancel your Lifetime Subscription within seven (7) calendar days of its start, you may receive a refund of the total subscription fee, though this refund mechanism may be canceled by wikiHow at any time. Any cancellations after seven (7) calendar days may not receive refunds.

By purchasing a subscription to wikiHow Pro, you acknowledge and agree to these terms.

Mobile Software
-----------------

A. Mobile Software.

We may make available software to access the Service via a mobile device (“Mobile Software”). To use the Mobile Software you must have a mobile device that is compatible with the Mobile Service. wikiHow does not warrant that the Mobile Software will be compatible with your mobile device. wikiHow hereby grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use a compiled code copy of the Mobile Software for one wikiHow account on one mobile device owned or leased solely by you, for your personal use. Frequently, wikiHow releases mobile software under an open source license. The particular terms of the license governing your use of the software will be displayed to you prior to downloading the software. By downloading and using the software, you agree to the terms of any applicable license. You acknowledge that wikiHow may from time to time issue upgraded versions of the Mobile Software, and may automatically electronically upgrade the version of the Mobile Software that you are using on your mobile device. You consent to such automatic upgrading on your mobile device, and agree that the terms and conditions of this Agreement will apply to all such upgrades. Any third-party code that may be incorporated in the Mobile Software is covered by the applicable open source or third-party license EULA, if any, authorizing use of such code. The foregoing license grant is not a sale of the Mobile Software or any copy thereof, and wikiHow or its third party partners or suppliers retain all right, title, and interest in the Mobile Software (and any copy thereof). Any attempt by you to transfer any of the rights, duties or obligations hereunder, except as expressly provided for in this Agreement, is void. wikiHow reserves all rights not expressly granted under this Agreement or the open source licenses associated with the software. If the Mobile Software is being acquired on behalf of the United States Government, then the following provision applies. Use, duplication, or disclosure of the Mobile Software by the U.S. Government is subject to restrictions set forth in this Agreement and as provided in DFARS 227.7202-1(a) and 227.7202-3(a) (1995), DFARS 252.227-7013(c)(1)(ii) (OCT 1988), FAR 12.212(a) (1995), FAR 52.227-19, or FAR 52.227-14 (ALT III), as applicable. The Mobile Software originates in the United States, and is subject to United States export laws and regulations. The Mobile Software may not be exported or re-exported to certain countries or those persons or entities prohibited from receiving exports from the United States. In addition, the Mobile Software may be subject to the import and export laws of other countries. You agree to comply with all United States and foreign laws related to use of the Mobile Software and the wikiHow Service.

B. Mobile Software from iTunes.

The following applies to any Mobile Software you acquire from the iTunes Store (“iTunes-Sourced Software”): You acknowledge and agree that this Agreement is solely between you and wikiHow, not Apple, and that Apple has no responsibility for the iTunes-Sourced Software or content thereof. Your use of the iTunes-Sourced Software must comply with the App Store Terms of Service. You acknowledge that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the iTunes-Sourced Software. In the event of any failure of the iTunes-Sourced Software to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price for the iTunes-Sourced Software to you; to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the iTunes-Sourced Software, and any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be solely governed by this Agreement and any law applicable to wikiHow as provider of the software. You acknowledge that Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims of you or any third party relating to the iTunes-Sourced Software or your possession and/or use of the iTunes-Sourced Software, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the iTunes-Sourced Software fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation; and all such claims are governed solely by this Agreement and any law applicable to wikiHow as provider of the software. You acknowledge that, in the event of any third party claim that the iTunes-Sourced Software or your possession and use of that iTunes-Sourced Software infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, wikiHow, not Apple, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim to the extent required by this Agreement. You and wikiHow acknowledge and agree that Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third party beneficiaries of this Agreement as relates to your license of the iTunes-Sourced Software, and that, upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement as relates to your license of the iTunes-Sourced Software against you as a third party beneficiary thereof.

Governing Law and Arbitration.
--------------------------------

A. Governing Law.

You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in California; and (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over wikiHow, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than California. This Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Santa Clara County, California for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below.

B. Arbitration.

For any dispute with wikiHow, you agree to first contact us at [wiki@wikiHow.com](mailto:wiki@wikiHow.com) and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that wikiHow has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any wikiHow claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to this Agreement, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein. The arbitration will be conducted in Santa Clara County, California, unless you and wikiHow agree otherwise. Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules. The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of that party’s data security, Intellectual Property Rights, or other proprietary rights. ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND WIKIHOW ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.

General
---------

A. Assignment.

This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by wikiHow without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.

B. Notification Procedures and Changes to the Agreement.

wikiHow may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our website, as determined by wikiHow in our sole discretion. wikiHow reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our Users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Agreement. wikiHow is not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you provide us. wikiHow may, in its sole discretion, modify or update this Agreement from time to time, and so you should review this page periodically. When we change the Agreement in a material manner, we will update the ‘last modified’ date on this page. Your continued use of the Service after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Use. If you do not agree to any of these terms or any future Terms of Use, do not use or access (or continue to access) the Service.

C. Entire Agreement/Severability.

This Agreement, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with wikiHow in connection with the Service, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and wikiHow concerning the Service. If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.

D. No Waiver.

No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and wikiHow’s failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

E. Contact.
