#### From Other Sources

We may obtain both Personal and non-Personal Information about you from other users of the Services, Retail Partners, business partners, vendor partners, contractors, suppliers, and other third parties. The Personal Information we collect in this manner includes the following:

* We may collect tracking links, click IDs, device IDs, IP addresses, and other online identifiers from marketing partners.
    

We, and the third parties we engage, may combine information we collect from you over time, and across the Services, with information obtained from other sources. This helps us improve the information’s overall accuracy and completeness, and also helps us better tailor our interactions with you.

We encourage you to review the privacy notices and settings of any social media platform with which you interact to help you understand the platform’s privacy practices.

#### Cookies and Similar Technologies

We and our partners use various technologies to automatically collect and store information when you interact with our Services, including the use of cookies, web beacons, mobile software developments kits (“SDKs”) or similar technologies:

* Cookies: When you access our Service, Shipt will issue a cookie to your device. A cookie is a small file that a website or application transfers to a visitor’s device for recordkeeping purposes. We use cookies to personalize visitors’ experiences on the Services, provide content that we believe may be of interest, track visitor trends and patterns, engage in marketing and advertising, and otherwise analyze the Services traffic. You may refuse to accept browser cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser. However, if you select this setting, you may be unable to access certain parts of the Services. For further information about cookies, including how to refuse cookies, please visit [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/). The categories of cookies Shipt uses include:
    
    * Strictly Necessary Cookies: These cookies are necessary for our websites to function and cannot be turned off or disabled. These cookies are usually only set in response to specific actions you take on our websites. For example, these cookies may be used to remember your selections or information you have entered when you navigate to different pages when visiting the websites.
        
    * Performance Cookies: Performance cookies help us learn how you use our websites to help improve their performance and design. These cookies provide us with aggregated statistical information such as number of page visits, page load speeds, how long a user spends on a particular page, and the types of browsers or devices used to access our websites. These types of cookies are deployed in connection with Analytics services we use (discussed below).
        
    * Targeted Cookies: These third-party cookies are placed by third-party advertising platforms or networks to collect information about your visits to and actions on certain pages of our websites so that they can deliver ads for relevant products and services to you later, such as when you are on the sites of third parties.
        
* Web beacons: Certain webpages maintained by Shipt, as well as emails sent by Shipt, may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags and single-pixel gifs) that collect information about page visits and email viewing. Web beacons allow us to track pages and content accessed and viewed by users, as well as to monitor email readership. Information collected may include limited personal information, such as name, email address and universal ID.
    
* Mobile device identifiers and SDKs: Shipt collects information from its mobile application users through deployment of mobile SDKs. A mobile SDK is the mobile app version of a web beacon. The SDK is a bit of computer code that app developers can include in their apps to enable ads to be shown, data to be collected, and related services or analytics to be performed.
    
* Analytics: Our Services may also use third-party analytics tools such as Google Analytics. Analytics are used to create reports and statistics on the performance of our website and present you with content tailored to your interests. Analytics can be used to collect information such as IP address, type of device, operating system, referring URLs, country information, date and time of page visits, and which pages you visit the most.

For more information about your options relating to your personal information and your communication preferences, see the “Your Choices” section below.

Personal Information and non-Personal Information may be linked together and once linked, may identify an individual person. If we do combine non-Personal Information with Personal Information, the combined information will be treated as Personal Information for as long as it remains combined.

#### Aggregate or Anonymized Data

In each case above, we may aggregate or anonymize the foregoing types of information in support of legitimate business purposes such that they are no longer capable of identifying you. In that event, the information is no longer considered “Personal Information” and may be used for any purpose consistent with applicable law.

When using deidentified data, Shipt does not attempt to reidentify the data. We may use and disclose deidentified or aggregated data to any third party without restriction, as permitted by applicable laws. We may use and disclose non-Personal Information for any purpose without restriction.

#### Public Data

These websites and services may have their own privacy notices, which the user will be subject to upon linking to the third party’s website. Shipt strongly recommends that users review the third party’s terms and conditions and privacy policies.

### Do Not Track Disclosure

Some browsers have a “do not track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. Except for legally-recognized universal opt out mechanisms (such as Global Privacy Control), we do not respond to “do not track” signals.

### Children

The Services are not intended for use by children. We do not intentionally gather Personal Information online about visitors who are under the age of 16. If a child has provided us with Personal Information, a parent or guardian of that child may contact Shipt to have the information deleted from our records. If you believe that we might have any information from a child under age 16, please contact us at [privacy@shipt.com](mailto:privacy@shipt.com). If we learn that we have inadvertently collected the Personal Information of a child under 16, or equivalent minimum age depending on jurisdiction, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.

* Collection via social media: We may collect personal data about social media users, including basic user profile information (such as username), user-generated content (such as posts, comments, pages, profiles, or feeds) and associated metadata (such as time and location of a post or comment); contact details (such as name, email address, telephone number if made public by the user); and additional individual information published by the user (such as employer, profession, age, location, education information, habits, etc.). The type and scope of personal data obtained from social media platforms depends on the type of APIs and permissions set out by the respective platforms and the administrative permissions granted by customers, where applicable.
    
* Third-party collection: From time-to-time, we may obtain marketing or lead lists from third party vendors. For example, we engage vendors who provide us with information that was collected from your interactions with third parties that indicate you may be interested in Shipt’s services. We use this information, for example, to send you marketing communications.
    

#### Sensitive Personal Information

Shipt does not collect or process “sensitive personal information” (as defined by the CCPA) for the purposes of inferring characteristics about California consumers. For example, Shipt does not collect or process geolocation information for the purposes of inferring characteristics about California consumers. Accordingly, Shipt treats any such information as “personal information” consistent with applicable provisions of the CCPA.

#### Applicable Retention Periods

Shipt determines the retention period for each category of personal information based on the criteria set forth above in the section titled “Retention of Personal Information”.

#### Sale or Sharing of Personal Information

##### _Retail Partners_

Shipt discloses some personal information concerning member transactions that may qualify as a sale of information as defined by the CCPA. For example, Shipt discloses purchase transactional information about a specific retailer with said retailer, such as transactions concerning how many Shipt Members used a particular retailer, and what items were purchased, during a specific time. This information may include personal information such as order ID, Member email address or telephone number.

In the past 12 months, Shipt has sold the following categories of personal information to its Retail Partners for the purposes of fulfilling our contracts with those Retail Partners:

* Identifiers: First and last name, email address, telephone number, order ID.
    
* Commercial information: Records of products or services purchased, obtained, or considered, and other purchasing or consuming histories or tendencies.

* Identifiers: First and last name, mailing address, email address, telephone number, retail loyalty card number or card ID, household identifier or primary card.
    
* Commercial information: Records of transactions and other purchasing histories.
    

Shipt sold such personal information for the purposes of allowing such third parties to provide targeted advertising and cross-context behavioral advertising services to others.

##### _Sharing_

As described elsewhere in this Notice, Shipt discloses personal information to its third-party analytics, advertising, and marketing vendors to assist such vendors in delivering interest-based advertisements on Shipt’s and others’ behalf to consumers when they interact with various websites or mobile applications. This activity may qualify as a “share,” as defined by the CCPA. Often, the personal information that is shared is collected and disclosed via the use of cookies, pixels, tags, and similar technologies. You can learn more about these technologies in the “Cookies and Similar Technologies” section above.

In the past 12 months, Shipt shared with (i) marketing/advertising service companies (including social media and third-party advertising platforms), and (ii) online analytics providers, the following categories of personal information for the purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising:

* Identifiers: First and last name, mailing address, email address, telephone number, retail loyalty card number or card ID, household identifier or primary card, IP address, device ad ID.
    
* Internet or other similar network activity: Cart additions, completed purchases, products browsed, ads interacted with, pages clicked on or through.
    
* Commercial information: Records of transactions and other purchasing histories.
    
* Geolocation information: City, zip code, or state of residence.
    

Shipt shared such personal information for the purposes of allowing such third parties to provide targeted advertising and cross-context behavioral advertising services to Shipt and others.

Additional information regarding how you may exercise your right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information is located below in the section titled, “How to Exercise Your Rights,” below.

Shipt does not have actual knowledge of any sales or sharing of personal information regarding minors under 16 years of age.

#### How to Exercise Your Rights

The CCPA provides California residents with the following rights relating to their personal information, subject to certain exceptions:

* Access/Data Portability: the right to request access to the personal information that Shipt collects, uses, discloses, sells or shares (including that personal information collected and used in the past 12 months) and the right to request that we provide copies of the specific pieces of personal information we collected about you.
    
    * If a verifiable consumer request is made, and subject to any exceptions or limitations under the CCPA, we will take steps to deliver the personal information to you electronically in a portable and readily useable format, to the extent technically feasible. Consistent with the CCPA and our interest in the security of your personal information, we will not provide copies of sensitive personal information we may receive from you (e.g., driver’s license number, other government-issued identification number, financial account number, account password, or security questions or answers) in response to a CCPA request, to the extent any of those items are in our possession.
        
* Deletion: the right to request that Shipt delete personal information we have collected from you subject to certain exceptions permissible by the applicable law.
    
    * Please note that if you are a Shipt Member and you submit a deletion request, your account will be deactivated. If you would like to continue your membership after deletion, you will need to set up a new membership account, which will be devoid of all prior order history or other information. We may retain an archived copy of your records as permitted or required by law.
        
* Do Not Sell: the right to request that Shipt opt you out of the sale of your personal information.
    
* Do Not Share: the right to request that Shipt opt you out of the sharing of your personal information for the purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising.
    
* Correction: if we maintain inaccurate personal information about you, the right to request that Shipt correct that inaccurate personal information, taking into account the nature of the personal information and the purposes of the processing of the personal information.
    

As mentioned above, if you are a Shopper or prospective shopper and a California resident, please refer to the [Shopper and Prospective Shopper Privacy Notice](https://www.shipt.com/shopper-privacy-policy/) for details on how to exercise your rights. If you are seeking employment with Shipt and a California resident, please refer to the Shipt Job Applicant Privacy Notice for details on how to exercise your rights.

* Do Not Share Requests: Contact Shipt at 877-557-1484 or click this [link](https://www.shipt.com/privacy/intake-form).
    

#### Universal Opt Out Mechanism

In addition, you may choose to enable a universal online tool that automatically communicates your opt out preferences, such as the Global Privacy Control. In accordance with applicable law, Shipt recognizes such universal opt out mechanisms and processes them in a frictionless manner as a request to opt out of the sale and sharing of your personal information at the browser level. Please consult and use the settings and extension available to you by your browser to implement any available universal opt out mechanism.

Shipt’s websites will recognize the use of a universal opt out mechanism. That said, your opt out request may be processed differently depending on whether you are logged into your Shipt account during your interaction with the applicable website. If you are logged into your Shipt account, your preference will be associated with your account, and the browser with which you exercised your choice.

If you are not logged into your account, your request will only be associated with that browser with which you exercised your choice; please use one of the methods identified below to opt out of the sale or sharing of your personal information collected by other means or to otherwise communicate your preference in connection with your Shipt account.

#### Processing Opt Outs

The CCPA requires us to comply with a consumer request to opt out of sales or sharing as soon as feasibly possible, but no later than fifteen (15) business days from the date the request is received. No verification is required; however, we may deny a request to opt-out of sales or sharing if we have a good-faith, reasonable, and documented belief that the request is fraudulent. In the event we deny a request for this reason, we will inform the consumer that we are not complying with the request and provide an explanation of why we believe the request is fraudulent.

Requests may be made using an authorized agent, if the consumer provides the agent with written permission signed by the consumer to act on the consumer’s behalf. We may deny a request if the applicable agent does not submit proof that it has been authorized by the consumer to act on the consumer’s behalf.

Once a consumer makes an opt out request, we will honor such request for at least twelve (12) months before asking the consumer to reauthorize personal information sales or sharing.

Additionally, if a consumer initiates a transaction or attempts to use a product or service that requires the sale or sharing of the consumer’s personal information, we may inform the consumer that the transaction, product or service requires the sale or sharing of the consumer’s personal information and provide the consumer instructions on how to opt in to sales or sharing.

Shipt uses an advertising service, Criteo, for internet based retargeting advertising. Criteo works through the use of a web pixel on Shipt’s website that will collect electronic information about you. Shipt does not see this information, which is transmitted directly to Criteo. Criteo considers the use of their product to be a potential data sale under California law. Accordingly, if you wish to opt out of the use of Criteo services with respect to your data, you may do so [via Criteo’s opt out mechanism](https://www.criteo.com/privacy/disable-criteo-services-on-internet-browsers/).

#### Process for an Access/Data Portability, Deletion or Correction Request

You will be required to provide at least 4 pieces of information which may include your name, mailing address, email address and phone number. Shipt will use this information to search our systems and determine if we have information about you. If we are able to locate information about you, we will fulfill your request. If we are not able to match the 4 pieces of information you submit, we may only be able to provide you with a report that includes the categories of Personal Information we collect, use, disclose or sell.

A link to your access report will be sent to you by email, which will be sent to the email address you provided at the time you submitted your request.

If you are an authorized agent, you will be required to submit your name, mailing address, email address and phone number as well as the name, mailing address, email address and phone number of the individual you are making a request on behalf of. Shipt will use the individual’s information to search our systems and determine if we have information about the individual. If we are able to locate the information about the individual, we will fulfill the request. As an authorized agent you will receive an email confirming that we received the request along with a second email asking you to fill out a certification form confirming your information and certifying that you have the right to make this request on behalf of the individual. Once the report is ready, it will be sent to the email address you have given us.

The CCPA requires us to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt; however, we may extend that period by an additional 45 days. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. We will deliver our written response via e-mail. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the twelve (12)-month period preceding the receipt of the verifiable consumer request. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access twice within a twelve (12)-month period, provided that you may request disclosure beyond the 12-month period as permitted by the CCPA. We will not charge a fee to process or respond to a verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing the request.

#### Our Commitment Not to Discriminate

Consistent with the CCPA, we will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights by:

* > Denying you goods or services.
    
* > Charging you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
    
* > Providing you with a different level or quality of goods or services.
    
* > Suggesting that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
    

#### Information for Residents of Washington

The Washington My Health My Data Act (the “MHMDA”) comes into force on March 31, 2024, and regulates the collection of “consumer health data” relating to “consumers” as defined in the MHMDA.  As of March 31, 2024 and in response to MHMDA, Shipt has implemented technical controls to prevent the sale of products through its platform to consumers that would result in it collecting “consumer health data” and will not otherwise collect such data.

#### Information for Residents of Other States

This section supplements the other information in this Notice and provides additional details for residents of Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, Oregon, and Texas (i.e., “consumers,” as defined by the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (“VCDPA”), Colorado Privacy Act (“CPA”), or Connecticut Data Privacy Act (“CTDPA”), Utah Consumer Privacy Act ("UCPA") Oregon Consumer Privacy Act (“OCPA”), and Texas Data Privacy and Security Act (“TDPSA”) respectively).

The categories of personal data sold by Shipt or processed by Shipt for the purposes of targeted advertising (as well as the categories of third parties who receive such data) are the same as those described above in the subsection titled [_Sales or Sharing of Personal Information_](#sales-or-sharing-of-personal-info) in Section B of [_Information for California Residents_](#california-section-b). Consumers can contact Shipt at the information in the “How to Contact Shipt” section below.

Shipt does not process any personal data for the purposes of profiling in furtherance of solely automated decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning a consumer.

Residents of Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, Oregon and Texas have the right under the VCDPA, CPA, CTDPA, UCPA, OCPA, and TDPSA (as applicable, and each subject to applicable limitations or exceptions) to:

* Confirm whether or not Shipt is processing the consumer’s personal data and to access such data;
    
* Correct inaccuracies in the consumer's personal data, taking into account the nature of the personal data and the purposes of processing of the consumer's personal data;
    
* Correct inaccuracies in the consumer’s personal data, taking into account the nature of the personal data and the purposes of the processing of the consumer’s personal data;
    
* Delete personal data provided by or obtained about the consumer;
    
* Obtain a copy of the consumer’s personal data, (a) for Virginia and Utah residents, that the consumer previously provided to Shipt, and (b) for Colorado and Connecticut residents –processed by Shipt, in a portable, and to the extent technically feasible, readily usable format that allows the consumer to transmit the data to another controller without hindrance, where the processing is carried out by automated means; and
    
* Opt-out of the processing of the consumer’s personal data for the purposes of: (i) targeted advertising, (ii) the sale of personal data, or (iii) profiling in furtherance of decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects concerning the consumer.
    

If you are a resident of Colorado, an explanation of how requests to opt out of the sale of personal data, or the processing of personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising using a universal opt out mechanism is in the “Information for California Residents” section above, in the sub-section titled “Process for Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information Requests”.

If you are a resident of Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, Oregon or Texas you may exercise these rights by clicking this [link](https://www.shipt.com/privacy/intake-form). We will verify your request using commercially reasonable efforts: this may include requiring you to provide at least 4 pieces of information which may include your name, mailing address, email address and phone number. Shipt will use this information to search our systems and determine if we have information about you. If we are able to locate information about you, we will fulfill your request, to the extent no exception or limitation under the VCDPA, CPA, CTDPA, or UCPA (as applicable) applies. If we are not able to match the 4 pieces of information you submit, we may only be able to provide you with a report that includes the categories of Personal Information we collect, use, disclose or sell. Note: Shipt does not sell Sensitive Personal Data or Biometric Information, as defined by the foregoing statutes.

If you are a resident of Colorado, Connecticut, Oregon, or Texas, requests to opt-out of the processing of your personal data may be made using an authorized agent. An authorized agent may be required to submit their name, mailing address, email address and phone number, as well as information about the consumer on whose behalf they are making the request, all of which will be used to authenticate the agent’s authority. We may deny a request if we cannot authenticate the authorized agent’s authority to act on the consumer’s request. Authorized agents may submit an opt-out request via this [link](https://www.shipt.com/privacy/intake-form).

Shipt will respond to the request within 45 days of receipt of the request; however, we may extend the period for response by an additional 45 days when reasonably necessary, in which case we will inform you of the extension together with the reason. If Shipt declines to take an action regarding your request, we will inform you of such, including the justification for declining to take action and instructions on how to appeal the decision.

Information provided in response to a request shall be provided free of charge. If requests are manifestly unfounded, excessive, or repetitive, Shipt may charge the consumer a reasonable fee to cover the administrative costs of complying with the request or decline to act on the request. Shipt will not charge Oregon residents a fee to confirm that inaccuracies were corrected or information was deleted in compliance with a previous request.

In the event Shipt declines to take action regarding your request, you may appeal the decision by contacting Shipt at: [privacy@shipt.com](mailto:privacy@shipt.com).
