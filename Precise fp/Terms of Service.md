PreciseFP Terms of Service
--------------------------

#### **Introduction**

Welcome to Docupace Technologies, LLC’s Website (the “Website”), including the PreciseFP ™ website and platform, an online data gathering and processing tool (the “Services”) which are available to you (a “Subscriber”) through the Website. Any use of the words “we”, “us”, “our”, “PreciseFP” or “Docupace” shall mean Docupace Technologies, LLC and any references to the words “you”, “user”, or “your” shall mean the Subscriber or Subscriber Firm to the Services. By using this software you agree to abide by the terms and conditions of use for the Services (the “Agreement”). If you agree to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, please click on the “Accept” button located below or, if you do not agree to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, please click on the “Cancel” button to return to the homepage of this Website. We intend this act of agreement and acknowledgment to be the legal equivalent of your signature on a written contract, and legally binding. Only by clicking Accept will you be able to access and use the Services available on the Website. If you have already registered and are reviewing this Online Subscription Agreement at a later time, then you have already accepted these terms by clicking Accept at your initial registration and you continue to be bound by them.

You may change or discontinue your account with us at any time. We reserve the right to modify, suspend or terminate access to the Services at any time for any reason without notice or refund, including the right to require you to change your login identification code or password. We also reserve the right to delete all program and data files associated with your account and/or other information you have on our system and change these terms and conditions from time to time.

Additionally, we may periodically send you communications announcing new offers and/or newsletters containing new developments at PreciseFP, including educational information on how to make better use of our products. You may opt out of receiving these communications at any time.

#### **Fees and Payment**

Paid Subscriptions: We will charge you a monthly fee for using the Services as well as additional fees depending on the type of service you have selected. You will be given the opportunity to pay by credit card for the Services, which will commence your paid subscription, after any trial period has elapsed. You can cancel your subscription at any time, but you will remain liable for all charges accrued up to that time and to the end of your monthly billing cycle. We do not provide a refund for any unused portion of your subscription. We reserve the right to change our fees at any time for any reason, but, whenever possible, we will give you at least one month advance notice of such change.

**Free Trial Subscriptions:** We may from time to time offer limited-term free trial subscriptions to the site. Each user is only allowed one free trial to the site, except when specifically waived in writing by PreciseFP. Once your free trial period expires, you agree to either pay the subscription fee or discontinue using the service. You also agree not to attempt to bypass access control features intended to prevent the violation of this policy.

#### **Rules of Use**

You agree to be bound by certain rules which are important for the proper use of the Services. Your failure to follow these rules, whether set forth below in this Agreement or in bulletins posted at various points on the Website, may result in termination of the Services.

You agree not to give your username and password or any other means for individuals other than yourself to gain access to your account and the Services to any other users. If other users are using your account, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account without a refund.

You agree that you will not knowingly solicit or collect personal information from children under 13 years of age without appropriate prior verifiable parental consent in accordance with applicable law.

You agree not to use our Services to commit a crime, or to plan, encourage or help others commit a crime, including crimes relating to computers.

Your firm’s account comes with a pre-allocated number of login IDs. It is a violation of these terms and conditions for multiple members of the firm to use the Website and its Services without obtaining a license for each user.

#### **Privacy Considerations**
