### Introduction

Welcome to Spectrum Input, LLC’s Website (the “Website”) and the Spectrum Input Services, including PreciseFP ™, an on-line data gathering and processing tool intended for investment advisors and other investment professionals (the “Services”) which are available to you (a “Subscriber”) through the Website. Any use of the words “we”, “us”, “our” or “Spectrum Input” shall mean Spectrum Input, LLC and any references to the words “you”, “user”, or “your” shall mean the Subscriber or Subscriber Firm to the Services. We start every new Subscriber relationship with an agreement pursuant to which you agree to abide by the terms and conditions of use for the Services (the “Agreement”). For first-time registrants, if you agree to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, please click on the “Accept” button located below or, if you do not agree to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, please click on the “Cancel” button to return to the homepage of this Website. We intend this act of agreement and acknowledgment to be the legal equivalent of your signature on a written contract, and legally binding. Only by clicking Accept will you be able to access and use the Services available on the Website. If you have already registered and are reviewing this Online Subscription Agreement at a later time, then you have already accepted these terms by clicking Accept at your initial registration (which is the only way to complete the registration process), and you continue to be bound by them.

You may change or discontinue your account with us at any time. We reserve the right to modify, suspend or terminate access to the Services on our Website at any time for any reason without notice or refund, including the right to require you to change your login identification code or password. We also reserve the right to delete all program and data files associated with your account and/or other information you have on our system and change these terms and conditions from time to time.

Additionally, we may periodically send you communications announcing new offers and/or newsletters containing new developments at Spectrum Input, including educational information on how to make better use of our products. You may opt out of receiving these communications at any time.

### Fees and Payment

Paid Subscriptions: We will charge you a monthly fee for using the Services as well as additional fees depending on the type of service you have selected. You will be given the opportunity to pay by credit card for the Services, which will commence your paid subscription, after any trial period has elapsed. You can cancel your account at any time, but you will remain liable for all charges accrued up to that time and to the end of your monthly billing cycle. We do not provide a refund for any unused portion of your subscription. We reserve the right to change our fees at any time for any reason, but, whenever possible, we will give you at least one month advance notice of such change.

**Free Trial Subscriptions:** We may from time to time offer limited-term free trial subscriptions to the site. Each user is only allowed one free trial to the site, except when specifically waived in writing by Spectrum Input LLC. Once your free trial period expires, you agree to either pay the subscription fee or discontinue using the service. You also agree not to attempt to bypass access control features intended to prevent the violation of this policy. For example, no user may avoid paying the subscription fees by registering for multiple successive free trials, or by any other means.

### Rules of Use

You agree to be bound by certain rules which are important for the proper use of the Services. Your failure to follow these rules, whether set forth below in this Agreement or in bulletins posted at various points on the Website, may result in termination of the Services. Do not tell others your password or let your account be used by anyone except yourself. This is not only to ensure economic fairness to us, the vendor, but it is to protect you, the user, by ensuring that your account’s audit trail is not affected by another user’s actions. Accordingly, you agree not to give your username and password or any other means for individuals other than yourself to gain access to your account and the Services to any other users. If other users are using your account, we reserve the right to suspend your account and issue a new confidential username and password, demand payment from you to cover such additional use, and to exercise our right to terminate your account without any refund. Do not attempt to log in more than once simultaneously on any given account without specific permission of the system operator for the Services. You agree that you will not knowingly solicit or collect personal information from children under 13 years of age without appropriate prior verifiable parental consent in accordance with applicable law. Finally, do not use our Services to commit a crime, or to plan, encourage or help others commit a crime, including crimes relating to computers.

Your firm’s account comes with a pre-allocated number of login IDs. At a minimum, your account must have a login ID for every professional within your firm, including those listed on your firm’s ADV. It is a violation of these terms and conditions to, after the expiration of the trial period, have fewer paid subscriptions than there are current professionals at your company. For example, a firm with 5 financial professionals cannot have a 3-user subscription to PreciseFP. You may have accounts for non-professionals, such as support staff.
