### Introduction

Spectrum Input, LLC, the developer of PreciseFP, a client data-gathering tool used by financial professionals, is committed to protecting your privacy by ensuring the security of your information on our website.

Spectrum Input, LLC will never disclose or share your personally identifiable information with a third party that is not a sub-processor associated with Spectrum Input LLC, unless required by law to do so (for example, to comply with a subpoena).

If you were invited to use PreciseFP by a financial professional, you should also verify his/her Privacy Policy. Your financial advisor and, if applicable, the firm with whom he/she is licensed, also has access to your personal information on PreciseFP. Your advisor uses your personal information, in conjunction with our software, to provide customized financial planning services.

### What Personal Information Do We Collect and How Do We Use It?

When you register for the first time, we will ask you to provide pieces of information that help us locate you within our system. Examples are your name, e-mail address, and contact information. You will also be asked to create a password, which should not be shared with anyone.

We use your name to personalize your financial professional’s unique PreciseFP online client forms and PDFs; both of which are generated by the system. We use your email address to confirm your subscription, username and password, and to provide customer service. As a registered user, when you select the option to customize, create or access your client forms, we will recognize you by your username and password. We may also use the contact information we collect to notify you about any new functions included in our software or new services offered by our website.

We share some of your personal information with vendors/sub-processors with the purpose of providing an essential service to Spectrum Input, LLC. An audited minimum relevant set of personal information is shared with each vendor. Here is a list of our vendors that process personal information:

1. **AWS (Amazon Web Services)** – The bulk of your data will be stored in our infrastructure hosted with AWS.
2. **Stripe** – Payment / subscription information is stored and managed here.
3. **Intercom** – Support and marketing platform that provides our online chat messenger and automated emails.
4. **Bugsnag** – Alert platform used for identifying and debugging errors.
5. **Google** – Analytical data is stored and processed here through products like Analytics, or Drive.

What Financial Information Do We Collect and How Do We Use It?
--------------------------------------------------------------

To use our online client forms, your financial professional will invite you to input personal financial data for you and, if applicable, your spouse or partner, and any other family members that you identify. The requested personal financial data can include, but is not limited to, such components as annual income, current values of and annual additions to investment assets, and lifetime and legacy-related goals. In many instances, these entries are optional. All financial professionals’ forms are unique, since PreciseFP allows for the editing of form templates. Fields and other content within the forms will vary from one account to another. Our software facilitates the capturing, storage, and transmission of data that relates specifically to you and your unique financial situation.
