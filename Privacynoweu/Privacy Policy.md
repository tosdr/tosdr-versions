Privacy policy
==============

Our privacy policy is very simple as we do what we can to collect as little information about our visitors. _**In fact, we don’t collect anything at all**_! No IP addresses. No cookies. Nothing at all! According our opinion there is a simple rule to follow – the less information we have the less can be leaked.

Our site is set up with the tool [webbkoll.dataskydd.net](https://webbkoll.dataskydd.net/en/) in mind. According this tool our site has a quite good rating. You can scan our site [here](https://webbkoll.dataskydd.net/en/check?url=privacynow.eu&refresh=on).

We use a [Let’s Encrypt](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/index.html) certificate for https encryption. SSL Labs gives this certificate [Grade A+](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=privacynow.eu&hideResults=on).

privacynow.eu is hosted by One.com Group AB, a Swedish company. The servers are located in Denmark. The Data Processor Agreement (DPA) can be found [here](https://www.one.com/static/info/data-processing-agreement-en.pdf), but as we don’t collect any personal data we actually don’t need a DPA.

Of course we have to realise One.com Group AB log what you as visitor to privacynow.eu do while visiting our site. [This page](https://help.one.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005593605-How-are-my-Statistics-calculated-) explains a bit what One.com Group AB log.
