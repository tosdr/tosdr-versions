Exxon Mobil appreciates your interest in this Web site and other related or linked ExxonMobil sites (collectively, “Site”). Your privacy is important to us and we want you to understand our practices with respect to the gathering and handling of your personal data. This Privacy Policy describes those practices.

ExxonMobil provides additional privacy notices for specific uses of certain personal data. For example, we provide additional notices to visitors to our facilities, to our suppliers, to job applicants, to users of specific mobile Apps, and to participants of our loyalty programs. The relevant ExxonMobil affiliates will process the personal data in accordance with the privacy notices they provide for such specific uses. When these notices apply to you, we recommend that you read them carefully. To the extent the personal data is collected from individuals in the European Economic Area (EEA), Switzerland or UK through the Site, we refer you to the  Privacy Statement of the relevant Country on our [landing page](https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/Global-legal-pages/Our-privacy-policies/). 

This Privacy Policy sets forth general Personal Data privacy principles that ExxonMobil follows with respect to Personal Data being processed in our business operations. Our data privacy policies may vary among the countries in which we operate to reflect local practices and legal requirements. Where national Personal Data protection and privacy laws require a higher standard of protection for Personal Data than presented in this Privacy Policy, the requirements of applicable Personal Data protection law reflected in the relevant country privacy policy notice shall prevail. Therefore, ExxonMobil encourages you to read in addition to this Privacy Policy our country privacy policy notices for further information on our Personal Data protection practices and your rights.

Note that some goods or services may not be available if you choose not to provide the necessary personal data.

#### Targeted advertising, and our use of social media sites

We may use the information we collect through the Site to help manage our on-line advertising. For example, we may use information collected from the Site, to show you ads for our products and services when you visit other websites, e.g., third-party social media sites, news sites and (video) search engines.

Note: you will be taken to a third-party website.

Our Site also provides links to others’ websites. This may include social plug-ins to Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and other social media. In case we receive certain statistical information regarding the click-through via these links or social plug-in, we will treat such statistical information in accordance with applicable laws. By clicking on such links or social plug-ins, an online connection will be established between your browser and the servers of the relevant websites and as a result certain personal data may be collected by these websites. ExxonMobil does not own, control or maintain these websites. We recommend that you review the privacy policy of these other sites carefully and contact the operator if you have concerns or questions.

### 5\. DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL DATA TO EXTERNAL PARTIES

We contract with other companies and persons to perform functions on our behalf. They have access to personal data needed to perform these business purposes, but may not use it for other purposes.

For example, ExxonMobil may share the personal data it collects automatically, directly from you, or from vendors or via social media with (other) vendors in order to allow ExxonMobil to fulfill orders and make deliveries, to send postal mail, and e-mail, to manage customer lists, analyze data, provide marketing assistance, host websites, process card payments, and provide and improve customer service. Furthermore, communicating via the Internet and sending information, products, and services to you by other means necessarily involves your personal data passing through or being handled by third-parties.

Before any personal data is shared with service providers, we enter into a written agreement which requires them: (1) not to make any unauthorized disclosures of the personal data; (2) to use the personal data only for the specified purposes and only according to the instructions received from ExxonMobil; (3) to retain the personal data only as long as necessary or to protect company interests; and (4) to have in place adequate and appropriate security measures. In some circumstances, ExxonMobil may disclose any of the categories of personal data it collects to vendors, including competent authorities, legal advisors, Exxon, Mobil, or Esso-branded fuel station operators, payment and loyalty card issuers, and other contracted parties. These vendors process the personal data on their own behalf, for instance: if required by law, in order to defend ExxonMobil’s rights, or to handle individuals’ complaints and requests. We may also share your information in connection with a transfer of assets, or if we are otherwise involved in a merger or transfer. Only when permitted by applicable law and with your consent as required, will we distribute personal data to vendors, such as ExxonMobil distributors, for the purpose of allowing them to market their products and services to you.

#### ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR US CUSTOMERS

ExxonMobil may disclose personal information of ExxonMobil Rewards+ loyalty members to certain suppliers in exchange for product rebates that are passed 100% along to the purchasing Rewards+ member. Such disclosures are not made unless the member opts for the rebate and provides identifying membership information (ExxonMobil Rewards+ number or telephone number) at the time of purchase. More information on this product rebate program is available in the ExxonMobil Rewards+ privacy notice. ExxonMobil does not sell personal information to third parties outside the scope of the ExxonMobil Rewards+ loyalty program. In the past twelve months since this Privacy Policy took effect, for commercial purposes, we have processed or shared for cross-context behavioral advertising (targeted advertising) the following categories of personal information to web and data analytics service providers, search engine and social media platform providers: \[IP address, web and app usages information, interaction with our sites and applications.\]. Please see further details in **Section 4** about cookies and similar technologies.

### 6\. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS OF PERSONAL DATA

#### 6.1 Transfers between affiliates

The relevant ExxonMobil affiliate who is the Data Controller may make personal data available to other ExxonMobil affiliates and may transfer some or all of the personal data to ExxonMobil servers located worldwide in accordance with applicable law. 

The transfer of personal data from the EEA, UK and Switzerland to recipients located outside such territories is subject to restrictions. ExxonMobil has taken steps to ensure that personal data receives an adequate level of data protection at all ExxonMobil locations. These steps include ExxonMobil affiliates entering into Binding Corporate Rules (“BCR”) which were approved in accordance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (please visit the link here to read our BCR) 

#### 6.2 Transfers to third parties

When transferring personal data, ExxonMobil puts in place safeguards to ensure that the recipient adequately protects the personal data. With respect to the transfer of personal data from the EEA, UK and Switzerland to outside such territories, ExxonMobil relies on (1.) EU “Standard Contractual Clauses”, (2.) contractual safeguards imposed on the recipient which is contracted by ExxonMobil affiliates outside of EEA, UK or Switzerland (so-called onward transfers),  and (3.) protections available under local law for the recipient established in a country deemed adequate by the EU Commission. Where permitted, and as applicable, we will rely on the individual’s consent.

For more information about specific transfer mechanisms, including information on existing safeguards implemented by ExxonMobil, please contact [data.privacy.office@exxonmobil.com](http://corporate.exxonmobil.com/en/global-legal-pages/data.privacy.office@exxonmobil.com).

### 7\. ACCURACY OF PERSONAL DATA

ExxonMobil endeavors to keep personal data that it collects accurate and complete. ExxonMobil relies on the individuals to maintain the accuracy and completeness of the personal data.
