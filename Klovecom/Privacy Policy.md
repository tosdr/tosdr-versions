We may share some of your personal information with third parties for business reasons, as outlined below: 

* Affiliates. We may disclose certain personal information we collect about you to our affiliates (e.g., our subsidiaries and entities under common ownership with EMF) to complete the performance of Services or related transactions.
* Third Party Vendors and Service Providers. Like many businesses, we sometimes engage other companies to perform certain business-related functions for us, such as consulting, service processing and the like (“Vendors” or “Service Providers”).Examples of such functions include mailing, emailing and texting communications to you, maintaining our databases, and processing payments.When we employ another entity to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the personal information that they need to perform their specific function.
* Analytics Partners. As noted above (“How We Collect Your Information - Automatic Browser Collection”), we may use third-party online tracking and analytic services (such as Google Analytics, Facebook, or others) and share certain personal information with them to help us understand how you use our Services and how to improve upon your experience with those Services. Each such third-party’s use of your personal information is dictated by their respective privacy policy.Please see our “Cookies” section below for more information.

**Cookies**

  

As mentioned above, when you visit us on our Sites or use one of our mobile applications, we collect information about you by using cookies, pixels, and other tracking technologies, which we may combine with other personal information we collect about you. Some examples of the data we collect from cookies and similar technologies include your account preferences, pages accessed, language preferences, and previous visits to our websites. We use this information to better understand, customize, and improve your experience using our Services, as well as to manage our advertising. For example, we use third-party analytics and advertising partners' automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate usage of our Sites. We use these tools to help us improve the performance of our Site and our users’ experience on our Site. 

These third party entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their services for us. To learn more about Google’s privacy practices, please review the [Google Privacy Policy](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/). You can also [download the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) to prevent your data from being used by Google Analytics.

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to control whether you will accept cookies, reject cookies, or to notify you each time a certain type cookie is sent to your browser. You may also disable certain third party tracking cookies that we use on our Sites when our sharing of your personal information constitutes a "sale", as further described under the California Privacy Notice, below. Please note that, if you disable cookies on our Sites, some functionality of the Sites will be lost. 

Currently, our systems do not recognize browser “do-not-track” signals.

  

**Ad Network.** We use network advertisers to serve advertisements on non-affiliated websites or other media (e.g., social networking platforms). This enables us and these network advertisers to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested. Ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, pixels, LSOs and other tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These cookies and other technologies are governed by each entity's specific privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these advertisers with information, including personal information, about you.

Users may opt out of many ad networks. For example, you may go to the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") [Consumer Choice Page](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding having information used by [DAA companies](http://www.aboutads.info/participating/). You may also go to the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") [Consumer Opt-Out Page](https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1) for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding having information used by [NAI members](http://www.networkadvertising.org/participating-networks).

Opting out from one or more companies listed on the DAA [Consumer Choice Page](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) or the NAI [Consumer Opt-Out Page](https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1) will opt you out from those companies' delivery of interest-based content or ads to you, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any advertising through our website or on other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you opt out on the DAA or NAI websites, your opt out may not be effective. Additional information is available on the DAA's website at [www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/) or the NAI's website at  [www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/).

  

**Children**

  

Children under age 13 (minors) always should get permission from a parent or guardian before providing any personal information about themselves. However, sometimes minors contact us to make a donation, seek a prayer, or request pastoral counseling, or they may interact with us at a Dare to Dream school assembly program or attend a cruise or event, from which we may collect their personal information. If you are a parent of a child under the age of 13, you may contact us at the Contact Information below, to request the information about your child that we have collected or request that we delete such information.

We are providing this **Privacy Notice for California Residents** ("Notice") pursuant to the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA"). Notice supplements our Privacy Policy.  Capitalized terms used in this Notice but not defined shall have the meaning given to them in the CCPA. 

  

Categories of Personal Information We Collect

  

We have collected the following CCPA categories of personal information within the past 12 months (and we have disclosed information within each of these categories to our third party partners and others within the past months, as detailed in the section on "Disclosures and Sales of Personal Information", below):

_Customer Records_ such as name, contact information, education, employment, employment history and financial information.

  

_Commercial Information_ such as transaction information, purchase history, financial details and payment information.

_Geolocation data_ such as device location.

Sources of Personal Information

  

We collect the categories of personal information identified above from the sources listed in the “How We Collect Your Information” section of our Privacy Policy, above.

  

Disclosures and Sales of Personal Information

  

We have disclosed each of the above-listed categories of personal information for a business purpose within the last 12 months to various third party entities (such as to companies that provide services to us, including our affiliates and subsidiaries, advertising networks, data analytics providers, social networks, internet service providers, operating systems and platforms, or where we are required by law to do so)(For more information about the business or commercial purposes for which we may disclose such information and the categories of third parties to which we may disclose such information, see the “Information We Share” section of our Privacy Policy, above.)

  

Under the CCPA, a “sale” includes disclosing or making available personal information to a third party in exchange for monetary compensation or other benefits or value.  While we do not disclose personal information to third parties in exchange for monetary compensation, we may disclose or make available certain categories of personal information to third parties in order to receive certain benefits or services, such as when we make browsing information available to third party ad companies (through third party tags on our Sites) in order to improve and measure our ad campaigns and reach users with more relevant ads and content.

  

As defined by the CCPA, we may “sell” certain categories of personal information as follows:

* Identifiers to third party advertising networks, data analytics providers and other entities that may perform services for us
* Usage Data to third party advertising networks and data analytics providers
* Customer Records to data brokers

  

To Exercise Your Consumer Privacy Rights

  

Subject to certain exceptions, under the CCPA, consumers have the right to request information from us about the personal information we collect about them.  Although the CCPA only gives California residents the right to make these requests, we allow non-California residents with the same choices about their personal information. You may make any of the following requests about our collection, use and sharing of your personal information:

* _Requests for Access to Information._ You may request a copy of the specific personal information or the categories of information that we collected about you during the past 12 months and information about how we have collected, used, and shared your personal information during the past 12 months. This includes the categories of personal information collected; categories of sources of personal information; categories of personal information we have disclosed or shared with a third party for a business purpose; categories of third parties to whom we have sold their personal information and, for each, the specific categories of personal information sold; and the business or commercial purposes for collecting or selling personal information.
* _Deletion Requests._ You may ask us to delete the personal information that we collected or maintain about you, with certain exceptions (detailed below).
* _Do-Not-Sell Requests._ You may ask us not to sell your personal information by submitting a consumer privacy request as per below. You also may opt-out of certain third party cookies on our Sites/mobile applications (as described more fully in the "Cookies" section in our Privacy Policy above) by adjusting your browser settings to remove or reject such cookies.

  

_Non-discrimination._ Consumers also have the right not to be subject to discriminatory treatment for exercising their privacy rights. This means, for example, that when a consumer exercises their consumer privacy rights, we will not deny the consumer any goods or services or provide them with a different level or quality of goods or services.

  

Submitting Consumer Privacy Rights Requests

  

To exercise your consumer privacy rights as stated above, you may submit a request to us, as follows:

\-- Online using our [Privacy Rights Request Form](https://submit-irm.trustarc.com/services/validation/eb6dd323-c1d2-4565-bd52-1aa8f0c66ab1)

\-- Emailing us at privacy@kloveair1.com

\-- Calling us toll-free at (800) 525-5683.

  

In order to submit a consumer privacy rights request, you will need to provide us with the following identifying information so that we may process your request: your name, your mailing address, your telephone number, and your email address.  We will need to verify your identity before we can provide a substantive response to your request. Only you, or an authorized agent that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a consumer privacy rights request related to your personal information. You may also make a request on behalf of your minor child. 

  

In order to verify your request, we ask that you:

* Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized agent who is properly registered and has been authorized in writing by the consumer whose personal information is being requested (we will ask authorized agents to provide the consumer's written authorization for confirmation).
* Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.

  

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.

  

Exceptions to Consumer Privacy Rights Requests.

  

In certain circumstances we may decline your consumer privacy rights request, such as where fulfilling a request may interfere with a transaction you have asked us to process for you or to comply with other obligations under other applicable laws. If we deny your request, we will communicate our decision to you. We will not penalize you for making a request.

  

**Changes to Our Privacy Notice**

  

We reserve the right to amend this privacy notice and other notices at our discretion and at any time, including updating regarding our data practices and your rights, modify our methods for responding to your requests, and/or supplement our response to your requests. When we make changes to this privacy notice, we will notify you by email or through a notice on our Sites' homepages.
