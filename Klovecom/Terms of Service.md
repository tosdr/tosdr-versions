-----------------------------

We value your privacy. Please visit [https://www.klove.com/policies/privacy-policy](https://www.klove.com/policies/privacy-policy) to view our privacy policy.

These Terms of Use apply to the internet websites and mobile applications (collectively, the “Sites”) owned and operated by Educational Media Foundation (including through its brands, K-LOVE, Air1, AccessMore, K-LOVE ON DEMAND (KLOD), and others), and its affiliated companies, including but not limited to, WTA Media LLC, Crisis Response LLC, and Dare II Dream LLC (collectively, ("EMF,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). Through our Sites, EMF operates electronic platforms/systems including web and mobile applications that enable our audiences and listeners to access and use certain EMF online products and services (collectively, the "Services"). IF YOU ACCESS OR USE OUR SITES OR SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS OF USE.

### **CONTENT**

The Sites and Services, and all text, graphics, user interfaces, visual interfaces, photographs, trademarks, logos, sounds, music, artwork, and computer code contained or displayed therein (collectively, the “Content”), including but not limited to the design, structure, selection, coordination, expression, "look and feel", and arrangement of such Content, contained on the Sites and Services, are for your personal, non-commercial use, and are intended for informational and entertainment purposes only.

Except as expressly provided in these Terms of Use, no part of the Sites, Services, or Content may be copied, reproduced, republished, uploaded, posted, publicly displayed, encoded, translated, transmitted, or distributed in any way, without EMF’s express prior written consent.

### **YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES**

You shall not knowingly introduce a virus or other harmful component, or otherwise tamper with, impair or damage any Site or Service or connected network, or interfere with any person or entity’s use or enjoyment of any Site or Service. You may not probe, scan or test the vulnerability of the Services or any network connected to the Services, nor breach the security or authentication measures on the Services or any network connected to the Services.

In order to access and use some of the Services, you will be required to register on our Sites. If you register on any Sites, keep the username and password you create upon registration private and do not allow others to access the Sites and Services under your name or in violation of these Terms of Use.

You may not use the Sites or Services or any Content for any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited by these Terms of Use.

### **USER GENERATED CONTENT AND INTERACTIVE AREAS**

Some of the Services may allow you to submit content ("User Generated Content") which may be accessible and viewable by the public, including blog comment posting areas, reader photo or video uploads, SMS text messaging, and mobile alerts. You may not submit or upload User Generated Content that is defamatory, harassing, threatening, bigoted, hateful, violent, vulgar, obscene, pornographic, or otherwise offensive or that harms or can reasonably be expected to harm any person or entity, whether or not such material is protected by law, or which infringes on the intellectual property rights of EMF or any third party. If EMF suffers harm or losses because of any User Generated Content you uploaded to any Site or Service, you are responsible for compensating EMF for such harm or losses, and you indemnify and hold EMF, our subsidiary and affiliated companies, and each of their respective employees, officers, directors, members, and agents harmless from any demands, loss, liability, claims, or expenses (including attorneys’ fees), made against us by any third party arising out of or in connection with our use and exploitation of your User Generated Content.
