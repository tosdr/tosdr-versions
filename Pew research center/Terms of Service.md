* identification of the allegedly infringing material and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material;
* your name, address and daytime telephone number, and an e-mail address if available, so that we may contact you if necessary;
* a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;
* a statement that you have a good faith belief that the use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
* a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Our designated agent is:

By Mail: Pew Research Center  
901 E Street, NW  
Washington, D.C. 20004  
Attn: Director, Legal Affairs

By email: info@pewresearch.org

Upon receipt of a notice of claimed infringement (or any statement in conformance with 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3)), we will expeditiously remove or disable access to the allegedly infringing content.  We will terminate the privileges of users who repeatedly infringe copyright.  Please note that United States law provides significant penalties for falsely submitting a notice of copyright infringement.

**11\. Choice of Law and Forum.** The Services are primarily intended for use by residents of the United States. If you use the Services from the European Union, these Terms will be governed by and shall be construed in accordance with the law of your home country, and the courts of your home country will have exclusive jurisdiction over any claim or dispute arising out of or relating to the Services. Otherwise, you agree that your access to and use of the Services will be governed by and will be construed in accordance with the law of the District of Columbia, without regard to principles of conflicts of laws.  You agree that any claim or dispute arising out of or relating to the Services must be resolved by a federal district court located in Washington, D.C., unless agreed upon by all parties.

Any use of geographical names on this Service or in any Content does not imply the expression of any opinion whatsoever on the part of the Center concerning the legal status of any country, territory, city or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. The Center takes no position on any sovereignty disputes between states; any reference to states, territories, or places on this site or in any Content is without prejudice to the outcome of any sovereignty disputes, legal disputes, or dispute resolution processes between states.

**12\. Miscellaneous**. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and the Center, superseding any prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between you and us. In the event any provision of these Terms is held unenforceable, it will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions and will be replaced by an enforceable provision that comes closest to the intention underlying the unenforceable provision. You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and us as a result of these Terms or your access to and use of the Services.

Our failure to enforce any provisions of these Terms or respond to a violation by any party does not waive our right to subsequently enforce any terms or conditions of the Terms or respond to any violations.  Nothing contained in these Terms is in derogation of our right to comply with governmental, court, and law enforcement requests or requirements relating to your use of the Services or information provided to or gathered by us with respect to such use.

**13\. Additional Survey Dataset Terms and Conditions**. Subject to these Terms and your continued compliance therewith, the Center provides you with a nonexclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable, revocable, worldwide, and royalty-free license to access, copy, reproduce, cite, link, display, download, distribute, broadcast, transmit, publish, modify, create derivatives of, or otherwise exploit the survey datasets (other than American Trends Panel survey datasets, which are governed by their own terms and conditions) made available on this website (“Data”), provided that:

* any reproduction, display, distribution, broadcast, transmission, or publication of the Data is limited to excerpts and may not be reproduced, displayed, distributed, broadcast, transmitted, or published in full or substantially in full;
* all copies and excerpts of the Data display all copyright and other applicable notices to the extent such notices are contained in such Data; and

Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved.

**14\. Privacy, Confidentiality and Security of Data**. The Center respects the privacy of individuals. The Center has taken measures to ensure that the Data is devoid of information that could be used to identify individuals (including, but not limited to, names, telephone numbers, and email addresses) who participated in or who were the subject of any research surveys or studies used to collect the Data (“Personally Identifying Information”). However, in the event that you discover any such Personally Identifying Information in the Data, you shall immediately notify the Center and refrain from using any such Personally Identifying Information.
