2\. **Changes to Terms**. We may change the Terms from time to time. The most recent version of the Terms will be posted on the Site and replace any prior versions. Your continued use of the Site following the posting of these changes will constitute acceptance of such changes. We also reserve the right to modify the content or access to any feature of the Site at any time.

3\. **Privacy**. Your use of the Site is governed by Company’s [Privacy Policy](https://therightstuff.biz/privacy-policy/), which is incorporated herein.

If you register with the Site, you consent to receiving service messages relating to your account, such as payment confirmations, account verifications and transactional notices. You also consent to receiving other communications from us such as newsletters, special offers, announcements and surveys, which you may opt out of by clicking on the “unsubscribe” links contained therein.

5\. **Geographic Restrictions**. You may not be able to access all or some of the content and services of the Site outside of the United States and such access may not be legal by certain persons or in certain countries. If you access the Site from outside the United States, you are responsible for compliance with local laws. You represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country, and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government “watch list” of prohibited or restricted parties, including the Specially Designated Nationals list published by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Treasury or the Denied Persons List published by the U.S. Department of Commerce.

6\. **Subscription, Free Trial, Billing and Cancellation**  
A. Free Access. You may access certain features of the Site free of charge. However, if you do not purchase a subscription, your access to the Site will be limited.  
B. Paid Subscription. You may access the subscription-only features of the Site by signing up for a paid subscription, which may start with a free trial. Only one person may use the user name and password associated with a subscription account. You may be required to provide a current, valid, accepted method of payment (“Payment Method”) to start your subscription or free trial. All subscriptions are renewed automatically on an annual, monthly or quarterly basis (as chosen by the Subscriber). When we renew your subscription, we will bill your Payment Method for the subscription fee. You may not be notified in advance of each renewal.

C. **Free Trial**. From time to time, we may offer free trials of the subscription service for a specified period of time. Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to determine your eligibility for a free trial, and to modify or withdraw a free trial at any time without notice or liability. We may require you to provide your Payment Method to start the free trial. On the first day after the free trial ends, we will begin billing your Payment Method for the subscription fee on a recurring basis, every year, unless you cancel prior to the end of the free trial period. However, we may authorize your Payment Method as soon as you register for a free trial. In some instances, your available balance or credit limit may be reduced to reflect the authorization during your free trial period. You may not receive notice from us that your free trial period has ended or that the paying period of your subscription has begun.

D. **Recurring Billing**. By subscribing to the Site and providing your Payment Method, you authorize us to bill your Payment Method for the subscription fee at the then current rate, and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the Site. You acknowledge that the amount billed each applicable period may vary for reasons including promotional offers, gift card redemptions and adding subscriptions. You authorize us to bill your Payment Method for such varying amounts, which may be billed in one or more charges during the billing cycle.

E. **Billing Cycle**. The subscription fee will be billed to your Payment Method at the start of the paying period of your subscription and every billing period thereafter unless you cancel your subscription or we terminate it. You must cancel your subscription before it renews for the next billing cycle in order to avoid payment of the next cycle’s subscription fee to your Payment Method. Subscription fees are fully earned upon payment. We automatically bill your Payment Method every term (Monthly, Quarterly, or Yearly). We reserve the right to change the timing of our billing.

F. **Price Changes**. We reserve the right to change pricing for subscriptions or any components thereof in any manner and at any time as we may determine in our sole discretion. Subject to these Terms, any price changes will take effect following email notice to you.

G. **No Refunds**. PAYMENTS ARE NONREFUNDABLE AND NO REFUNDS OR CREDITS WILL BE GIVEN FOR PARTIAL OR INCOMPLETE USE. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to provide refunds, discounts or credits to subscribers on one or more instances without obligation to do so in the future. If any or all of the features of the Site are temporarily unavailable, you will not receive a refund.

H. **Cancellation**. You can cancel your subscription at any time by logging into your account, selecting the 'subscription' tab in your profile and clicking the ‘cancel' button. Cancellation will become effective at the end of your current billing period. You will not receive a refund or credit for your current billing period. You may continue to access the subscription-only features of the Site for the remainder of your current billing period.

I. **Commenting.** The ability to post comments on the site's pages is not guaranteed by the act of paying for a subscription. While the comment section is limited to paid subscribers, at any given time the site administrators may deem it necessary to remove any or all users' commenting privileges without warning. **Your paid subscription guarantees access to premium video and audio content, it does NOT guarantee the ability to participate in discussions regarding said content on this website.**
