Last Revised October 19, 2021. Effective October 19, 2021.

1. This User Agreement (“user agreement” or “agreement”) is an agreement between M.O.B.A. Network AB (“ResetEra”, “we”, “our” “us”) and you. This agreement sets out the terms of your use of ResetEra.com (the “website”) and services, including, but not limited to, the provision of access to an on-line message board (the “services”).
