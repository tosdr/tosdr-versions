1. Authorised Service Providers: We may share Your personal information with Our authorised service providers that perform certain services on Our behalf. These services may include fulfilling orders, providing customer service and marketing assistance, performing business and sales analysis, supporting the Website functionality and supporting contests, sweepstakes, surveys and other features offered through the Website.

We also may disclose Your information\* In response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement or other government agency; to establish or exercise Our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases, We may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to Us, in Our sole discretion;

Any third parties to whom we may disclose personal information may have their own privacy policies which describe how they use and disclose personal information. Those policies will govern use, handling and disclosure of Your personal information once We have shared it with those third parties as described in this Privacy Policy. If You want to learn more about their privacy practices, we encourage You to visit the websites of those third parties.

Aggregated and non-personal information. We may share aggregated and non-personal information we collect under any of the above circumstances. We may combine non-personal information We collect with additional non-personal information collected from other sources. We also may share aggregated information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis. For example, We may tell Our advertisers the number of visitors to the Website and the most popular features or Service accessed. This information does not contain any personal information and may be used to develop content and service that we hope You and other users will find of interest and to target content and advertising.

**Third-Party Sites**

There are a number of places on the Website or through Our services where You may click on a link to access other websites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. For example, if You click on an advertisement, a third party’s content or a search result on the Website, You may be taken to a website that We do not control. These third-party websites may independently solicit and collect information, including personal information from You and, in some instances, provide Us with information about Your activities on those websites. We recommend that You consult the privacy statements of all third-party websites You visit by clicking on the “privacy” link typically located at the bottom of the webpage You are visiting. 

**Your Choices About Collection and Use of Your Information**

You can choose not to provide Us with certain information, but that may result in You being unable to use certain features of the Website because such information may be required in order for You to register as a member; purchase products or services; participate in a contest, promotion, survey, or sweepstakes; ask a question; post a comment; or initiate other transactions on the Website.

When You register on the Website We may send You emails and/or newsletters about Service updates, improvements, special offers, or containing special distributions of content by Us. At any time You can choose to no longer receive commercial or promotional emails or newsletters from Us by clicking on the UNSUBSCRIBE link at the bottom of any email message from Chaty. You also will be given the opportunity, in any commercial email that We send to you, to opt out of receiving such messages in the future. It may take up to 10 days for Us to process an opt-out request. We may send You other types of transactional and relationship email communications, such as service announcements, administrative notices and surveys. Please note that changing information in Your account, or otherwise opting out of receipt of promotional email communications will only affect future activities or communications from Us. If We have already provided Your information to a third party before You have changed Your preferences or updated Your information, You may have to change You preferences directly with that third party.

**How We Protect Your Personal Information**

We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard Your personal information from unauthorised access and disclosure. 

We want You to feel confident using the Website to transact business. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although We take steps to secure Your information, We do not promise, and You should not expect, that Your personal information, searches or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email.

**Access to information**

The Data Protection Act gives You the right to access information held about You. Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with the Data Protection Act. 

**No Rights of Third Parties**

This Privacy Policy does not create rights enforceable by third parties or require disclosure of any personal information relating to users of the website.

**Data retention**

The right of erasure: Our users can delete their account themselves from the interface (if they are not on a paid plan), or send us a request to delete their account and all the information related to it by contacting us through our [contact form](https://chaty.app/contact/).  
The data of your account is stored on our end as long as the account is active.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We will occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in Our practices and services. When We post changes to this Privacy Policy, We will revise the “Last Updated” date at the top of this Privacy Policy. If We make any material changes in the way We collect, use and/or share Your personal information, We will notify You by sending an email to the email address You most recently provided Us in Your Account, profile or registration (unless We do not have such an email address), and/or by sending a push notification or posting notice of the changes on the Website.
