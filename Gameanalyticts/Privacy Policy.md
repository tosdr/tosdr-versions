For example, you can be identified by your name or an online identifier.

**Personal Data we collect**
----------------------------

The type of Personal Data we collect about you will depend on our relationship with you. For the type of Personal Data we collect, see the table below in the section entitled ‘Purposes for which we use personal data and the legal bases’.

**How we collect your Personal Data**
-------------------------------------

We collect most of the Personal Data directly from you in person, by telephone, text or email and/or via our website.

However, we may also collect your Personal Data from third parties such as:

* reputable companies who provide lead generation contact lists
* others to whom you have provided consent
* publicly available sources such as social media platforms
* sub-contractors in technical, payment and delivery services
* advertising networks
* analytics and tracking software providers and
* search information providers

**Purposes for which we use personal data and the legal bases**
---------------------------------------------------------------

We will only use your Personal Data when the law allows. Most commonly, we will use your Personal Data in the following circumstances**:**

| **Purpose** | **Lawful Basis for Processing** |
| --- | --- |
| Responding to correspondence from you | It is in our legitimate interest to respond to enquiries made via our website, by email, through our social channels or any other means. |
| Sending you information on sales events or product information which may be of interest | If you are an existing customer or have expressed an interest in our products or services, we will rely on legitimate interests to contact you for marketing purposes.<br><br>You may object to the processing for this purpose by emailing privacy@gameanalytics.com. If we have captured your consent for the purposes of marketing, that consent may be withdrawn at any time by emailing privacy@gameanalytics.com or using the unsubscribe option. |
| Provision of our services | Processing is necessary for the performance of the contract between us. |
| To maintain a record of contact for current client engagement | It is our legitimate interest to maintain a record of the contact we have with you within our client database. |
| Business management, forecasting and statistical purposes | It is our legitimate interest to identify areas for managing current business relationships, develop new products and services, and for managing our business. |
| Improving our websites and the overall website visitor and user experience | It is our legitimate interest to allow analytics and search engine providers to help improve and optimise our websites. |

**Sharing your Personal Data**
------------------------------

We may also disclose your information to third parties in connection with other purposes set out in this privacy notice. These third parties may include:

* business partners, suppliers and sub-processors\* who may process information on our behalf
* advertisers, social media platforms, and advertising networks
* analytics and search engine providers

We do not control these third-party websites and are not responsible for their privacy statements. When you leave our site, we encourage you to read the privacy policy of every website you visit.

Where we are under a legal or regulatory duty to do so, we may disclose your details to the police, regulatory bodies or legal advisors, and/or, where we consider necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of GameAnalytics, its personnel, users or others.

**International Transfers**
---------------------------

Your Personal Data may be transferred internationally, this is because the organisations we use to provide our service to you are based outside the EU/UK.

We have taken appropriate steps to ensure that any Personal Data being processed internationally, still has an equivalent level of protection to that guaranteed in the EU/UK. We do this by ensuring that:

* Your Personal Data is only processed in a country which the Secretary of State has confirmed has an adequate level of protection (an adequacy regulation) or
* We either enter into EU Standard Contractual Clauses or an International Data Transfer Agreement (“IDTA”) with the receiving organisation and adopt supplementary measures where necessary. (A copy of the IDTA can be found here international-data-transfer-agreement.pdf (ico.org.uk))

**How long we keep your data**
------------------------------

We will retain your personal data for as long as is necessary to provide you with our services and for a reasonable period thereafter to enable us to meet our contractual and legal obligations and to deal with complaints and claims.

At the end of the retention period, your personal data will be securely deleted or anonymised, for example by aggregation with other data, so that it can be used in a non-identifiable way for statistical analysis and business planning.

**How we protect your data**
----------------------------

We implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect data against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage.

GameAnalytics is SOC2 Type II\*\* compliant and [ISO27001 certified](https://www.iafcertsearch.org/certification/0ec9433f-1a3f-503b-a8fa-5586c625eb07).

\*\* The SOC2 Type II Report is available upon request.

In addition to the technical and organisational measures we have put in place, there are simple things you can do to in order to further protect your personal information, such as:

1. Never share One Time Passcodes (OTPs) or passwords.
2. Never enter your details after clicking on a link in an email or text message.
