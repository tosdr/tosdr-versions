EdTech Impact Service Level Agreement
=====================================

This EdTech Impact Service Level Agreement (the “SLA”) applies to Services purchased from EdTech Impact Ltd. This SLA is incorporated into, and forms part of, the terms applicable to your access to and use of the EdTech Impact Platform (the “Terms”). Capitalised terms not defined in this SLA have the meanings given to them in the applicable Terms.

### Definitions

**“EdTech Impact Platform“** means EdTech Impact’s proprietary software, content, text, images, media, widgets, and other materials delivered through our web platform edtechimpact.com (including subdomains, successor domain names and sites).

**“Service Availability”** means the uptime of the EdTech Impact Platform, and is measured by subtracting the total minutes of Service Interruption in a given month from the total minutes in such month, divided by the total minutes in such month and then multiplied by 100.

**“Service Interruption”** means, except for scheduled system maintenance, the period of time that the EdTech Impact Platform is either (a) not available for Customer log-in or (b) substantially not functioning. Circumstances beyond our control will not constitute Service Interruptions.

**“Standard Support”** means the support provided by EdTech Impact help desk technicians in response to a ticket submitted by Customer through my.edtechimpact.com.

### Service Availability

The EdTech Impact Platform will have a Service Availability of at least 99.9% of the time in any calendar month (the **“Service Availability SLA”**). Where reasonably possible, EdTech Impact will provide at least 24 hours' advance notice to Customer of scheduled maintenance in excess of 30 minutes. If EdTech Impact does not meet the Service Availability SLA, Customer will be eligible to receive the Service Credits described below. This Service Availability SLA states Customer's sole and exclusive remedy for any failure by EdTech Impact to meet the Service Availability SLA.

| Service Availability of the EdTech Impact Platform | "Service Credits" (means days of Services added to the end of the Term at no charge to Customer) |
| --- | --- |
| < 99.9% - >= 99.0% | 3   |
| < 99.0% - >= 95.0% | 7   |
| < 95.0% | 15  |

### Customer Must Request Service Credit

In order to receive any of the Service Credits described above, Customer must notify EdTech Impact within 30 days from the day Customer becomes eligible to receive a Service Credit. Failure to comply with this requirement will forfeit Customer's right to receive a Service Credit.

### Maximum Service Credit

The aggregate maximum number of Service Credits to be issued by EdTech Impact to Customer in a single calendar month will not exceed 15 days of Services added to the end of Customer's Term. Service Credits may not be exchanged for, or converted to, monetary amounts.

### Customer Support

EdTech Impact will provide Customer Support in English during UK business hours for tickets submitted through my.edtechimpact.com.
