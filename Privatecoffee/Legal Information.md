GotHub is an alternative front-end for GitHub.
----------------------------------------------

### Features

* Lightweight - for both you and the instance host
* No JavaScript - pure HTML and CSS awesomeness
* No requests made to GitHub from the client side - they won't even know you made a request!
* Open source - for peer review & trustworthiness
* Save bandwidth - no JavaScript, tracking bloat or extra fonts loaded.

### Privacy

GitHub is owned by Microsoft, a big tech company known to track it's users. [If you care, you can read GitHub's privacy policy here](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement) [(TOS;DR)](https://tosdr.org/en/service/297). GotHub solves this by proxying all GitHub requests for you!

### Usage

Just replace `github.com` with `gothub.private.coffee` or `gist.github.com` with `gothub.private.coffee/gist`!

This project was made as a "spiritual successor" to [Riverside Rocks](https://riverside.rocks/)' [1337git](https://gothub.private.coffee/RiversideRocks/1337git) which is, unfortunately, hosted on GitHub. Kinda ironic.

_This project does not let you clone GitHub repositories. I would recommend using a VPN if you have to clone a GitHub repository and want to keep yourself private from them instead._
