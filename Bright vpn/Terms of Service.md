(“Bright” OR “US”, OR “OUR” OR “WE”); THIS AGREEMENT GOVERNS YOUR ACCESS AND USE OF, THE BrightVPN SOFTWARE (“SOFTWARE”), THE [BrightVPN](https://brightvpn.com/) WEBSITES (“SITE”) AND ANY ACCOMPANYING SERVICES, FEATURES, CONTENT AND APPLICATIONS (“FEATURES”) OFFERED BY US (ALL COLLECTIVELY REFERRED HEREIN AS THE “SERVICES”).

BY USING THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE THAT YOU WILL NOT USE THEM FOR ANY ILLEGAL OR UNAUTHORIZED PURPOSE.

### The Software

BrightVPN is a full VPN app service installed on your device. It allows you to proxy your Internet traffic through different countries so you can appear to look like you are browsing from those countries.

BrightVPN is provided free of charge, in return for you allowing use of your internet connection when available. Bright Data works with over 10,000 customers like major banks, universities, social networks, ecommerce sites, and many brands you know. Bright Data enabled these qualified customers to sometimes use your user’s Internet connection to gather web statistics, price comparison, and other verified business processes. You may opt out by uninstalling the service from your devices.
