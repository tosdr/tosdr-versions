Order. The Criteo Service will be charged on the basis set forth in the Insertion Order and will include the cost of the Criteo

Service. The Client will receive monthly invoices from the Criteo entity delivering the Criteo Service. In the event that there are

Order, the Client shall pay all amounts due, without set-off, within 30 days from the invoice date. All payments to Criteo shall be

made in the currency set forth in the invoice, and are quoted exclusive of any applicable tax, which shall be payable at the time

and in the manner required by law. Criteo shall be entitled to charge interest and recovery costs on overdue amounts as specified

by the relevant law or as set forth in the Insertion Order. Any dispute over an invoice must be raised within one month of receipt

Effective Date of the Terms, including, but not limited to, any and all patents, patent applications, trade secrets, trademarks,

computer object or source codes, research, inventions, technical or non-technical data, formulas, algorithms, compilations,

Rights”). Criteo is the sole owner of all Intellectual Property Rights in and to the Criteo Technology and Criteo Data. Client is the

sole owner of all Intellectual Property Rights in and to the Client Data. Client authorizes Criteo: (i) to collect, use, analyze, and

process the Client Data, to combine the Client Data with Criteo Data and Criteo Sourced Data, and to perform the Service for the

Client; (ii) to use the Aggregated Client Data to improve Criteo Technology, Criteo Service, and other Criteo products, programs

and/or services; and (iii) to disclose Client Data if required by law. For the duration of the Terms, the Client grants Criteo (including

Client’s name, logos and/or trademarks. Client shall not modify or attempt to modify the code or otherwise reverse engineer,

disassemble, decompile or create derivative works based on any aspect of the Criteo Technology.

condition, express or implied, with respect to any matter and expressly disclaims all express, implied, and statutory warranties,

including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of accuracy and results of use, merchantability, non-infringement, fitness for

a particular purpose, and any warranties arising from course of dealing, usage or trade. Client warrants and represents to Criteo

that: (i) it has the right, power, and authority to enter into these Terms and perform its obligations as set forth herein; (ii) it has

the right to provide the Client Content to Criteo for publication, without infringing any rights of any third party including, without

limitation, intellectual property rights; (iii) the Client Content complies at all times with all applicable laws, statutes, statutory

instruments, contracts, regulations, and advertising and marketing codes of practice in any of the jurisdictions where Product

applicable data protection laws; (vi) immediately upon termination of the Terms, Client shall remove all software code and Tags

or similar technologies provided by Criteo for inclusion on Client Properties; (vii) any information provided under the Terms is

true, accurate, complete, and current; and (viii) it shall comply with all relevant laws and regulations including any guidelines or

policies as made available by Criteo. Client agrees to defend and indemnify Criteo, and its present and former officers, directors,

members, employees, and agents, against all claims, suits, actions, damages, liabilities, losses, expenses, and costs (including

reasonable attorney fees, expert fees, and costs) arising out of or resulting from any action against Criteo that is based on any:

(a) breach, alleged breach or violation of any representations or warranties made by Client in these Terms; or (b) act or omission

from anyone receiving Criteo Service through Client .



8. Limitation of Liability: To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, neither Party shall be liable for any special,

indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive or exemplary damages in connection with the Terms, even if said Party has been

advised of the possibility of such damages. Neither Party shall have any liability for any failure or delay resulting from any

event, beyond the reasonable control of that Party including, without limitation, any act of God, fire, flood, earthquake,

insurrection, acts of war, terrorism, riots, civil disorders, civil unrest, rebellions, epidemics, pandemics, failures of public

networks, power or internet, explosion, embargo, strikes or other work stoppages (force majeure event). Client acknowledges

and accepts that the price paid by Client takes into account the risks involved in this transaction and represents a fair allocation

of risk. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in these Terms excludes or limits either Party’s liability for fraud, gross negligence,

death or personal injury or any other matter to the extent such exclusion or limitation would be unlawful. Save for the

indemnity in Section 7 above, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, each Parties’ liability under the Terms, for

whatever cause, whether in contract or in tort, or otherwise, will be limited to general/direct money damages, namely, the

amount which was foreseeable by Criteo at the time the Service was performed, and shall not exceed the total amount of fees

actually received by Criteo from Client for the specific Service from which liability arises during the six (6) month period

immediately preceding the event first giving rise to such liability, and if not yet in the sixth month, for the period leading up to

such event.



Client acknowledges and accepts the risk that third parties may generate impressions, clicks or other actions affecting the charges

under the Terms for fraudulent or improper purposes. Criteo shall have no responsibility or liability to Client in connection with

any third party click fraud or other improper actions that may occur.

including, but not limited to, laws governing privacy and data protection.

with the specific requirements of the competent local supervisory authorities.



When applicable laws and regulations require obtaining user consent, Client undertakes to:

(i) clearly inform users that they can give or withhold consent to Criteo dropping cookies (or other tracking

technologies), as well as the purposes of these cookies, in particular the purpose of serving personalized advertising,

10. Duration and Termination: The Agreement shall commence upon execution of the Insertion Order (the “Effective

Date”) and shall automatically terminate either on the date stated in the Insertion Order or on the date when the total budget

chosen by the Client (and as set out in the Insertion Order) is exhausted, unless terminated earlier as described herein.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may terminate the Terms without cause upon five (5) days’ notice and Client shall

pay for any Service performed during the notice period. These Terms shall terminate automatically and without notice if Client

becomes insolvent, goes into liquidation, or appoints an administrative receiver or analogous proceeding under relevant local

law. Expiration or termination (for any reason) of the Terms will be without prejudice to any other rights or remedies of the

Parties under these Terms or at law and will not affect accrued rights or liabilities of the Parties as of the date of termination.

survive or implicitly intended to survive shall so survive. Upon termination, all amounts owed to Criteo shall immediately become

due and payable.

these Terms, except its professional representatives or advisors or as may be required by law or any legal or regulatory authority,

the terms and conditions of an Insertion Order or any confidential information concerning the business or affairs of the other

Party (including the other Party’s affiliates) which is disclosed to it by the other Party. If such disclosure is required by law or any

legal or regulatory authority, the disclosing Party shall give the other Party written notice of such disclosure as soon as possible

prior to making the disclosure and upon request, shall assist the other Party in obtaining a protective order or other relief. To

the extent the Parties have entered into a separate non-disclosure agreement, it is expressly incorporated herein by reference.

independent contractors, subcontractors, and any other individual who have a “need to know” in order to perform Criteo’s

obligations under this Agreement and who: (i) have been advised of the confidential nature thereof and (ii) agree to be bound by

the terms in this Section.



12. Assignment: Neither Party may assign its rights or delegate its obligations under the Terms, and any attempt at such

assignment will be void, unless with the prior written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably

withheld or delayed. The Terms will be binding upon the Parties’ respective successors and permitted assigns. For purposes of

these Terms, “assignment” shall include a merger, acquisition, or other consolidation by, with, or of Client, including any new or

surviving entity that results from such merger, acquisition, or other consolidation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party

may assign its rights and obligations under the Terms to a parent or subsidiary. In any event, Client shall not assign the Terms to

a competitor of Criteo, or its successors or assigns. In addition, nothing herein shall prohibit Criteo from assigning the Terms to

an affiliate, subsidiary, or agent of Criteo, nor shall such assignment be considered a violation of this provision.

subject of any sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of Treasury, the European

Union, or any other applicable sanctions authority. Each Party agrees to perform its obligations hereunder in compliance with all
