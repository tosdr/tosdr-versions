These Community Guidelines ("Guidelines") are intended to help You understand the types of content that ProBoards believes to be inappropriate for use in connection with the Website and Services (all capitalized terms not defined in these Guidelines have the same meanings as in ProBoards' [Website Terms of Service](https://www.proboards.com/tos)). Keep in mind that the Guidelines are intended as guidelines, and not as an exhaustive list of content that ProBoards finds inappropriate. ProBoards reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reject any content for any reason.

### Intellectual Property Rights

As ProBoards asks others to respect ProBoards' intellectual property rights, ProBoards respects the intellectual property rights of others. If you believe content located on or linked to by the Website violates your copyright, you are encouraged to notify ProBoards in accordance with ProBoards' [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](https://www.proboards.com/dmca). For more information, see ProBoards' [Website Terms of Service](https://www.proboards.com/tos).

### Forum Staff Privacy Responsibilities

ProBoards may share certain personal data with forum members, such as admins, moderators, and other forum members (collectively,"Forum Staff"), as set forth in the [Privacy Policy](https://www.proboards.com/privacy). For example, when a user registers or posts to a forum, the user's email address, IP address, and time and date of the post may be made available to the Forum Staff.

Under the laws of many jurisdictions, Forum Staff who have access to non-public personal data of users share ProBoards' responsibility to ensure such data remains private and is used, transferred, or disclosed only in accordance with ProBoards' Privacy Policy. Accordingly, Forum Staff should only disclose user personal data to other Forum Staff on a need-to-know basis—for example, if a particular user is banned from the forum, the user’s IP address could be confidentially and securely disclosed to enforce the ban. Forum Staff should never publicly disclose personal data of users—including by posting it to the forum, even if the forum is private—unless the user has already publicly disclosed or expressly consented to disclosure of the data in question. Forum Staff are encouraged to take the proverbial high road in managing user conflicts and should never exploit non-public personal data in resolving such disputes.

If Forum Staff collects any personal data of users (including for analytics purposes) outside of what is collected and provided to them by ProBoards, then they are responsible for ensuring they obtain the express informed consent of each user prior to doing so. It is up to the Forum Staff to ensure its disclosures, consent mechanism, usage, storing and sharing practices comply with all applicable laws.
