### Binding terms and conditions

These Terms and Conditions apply to web sites and interactive services (hereafter individually a “Service” and collectively the “Services”) owned or operated by FACE IT LIMITED (hereafter the “Company” or “FACEIT”) and its subsidiaries and affiliates. By registering for an account and/or becoming a member to participate in any game or tournament offered on faceit.com and/or any of its subdomains (hereafter the “Site”) you confirm your knowledge of and agreement to be bound by the then most current version of these T&C, which can be accessed from the Site. FACEIT may modify these T&C at any time, without advance notice. You are responsible for reviewing these T&C periodically for any modifications. Your continued use of the Site following such modifications signifies your acceptance of those modifications. Additional terms may apply to your use of any Service, including contest rules and eligibility. We will provide these terms to you or post them on the website pages to which they apply; they are incorporated by reference into these T&C. If there is a conflict between these T&C and any additional terms that apply to a particular Service, the additional terms will control. The section titles used in these Terms are purely for convenience and carry with them no legal or contractual effect.

As set out in more detail below, FACEIT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO IMMEDIATELY SUSPEND AND/OR CLOSE THE ACCOUNT OF ANY MEMBER WHO VIOLATES, OR WHOM FACEIT REASONABLY BELIEVES MAY BE OR WILL BE VIOLATING, THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SERVICE, AT ANY TIME WITHOUT NOTICE. Please note that if a member’s account is closed due to a violation of the T&C, FACEIT reserves the right to determine how the member’s account balance will be distributed.

If any provision of these terms and conditions is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the invalidity of that provision will not affect the validity of the remaining provisions, which shall continue to have full force and effect. No person other than the parties to these terms and conditions are intended to benefit from them pursuant to the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.

This Website is owned by FACE IT LIMITED (hereafter “Company” or “FACEIT”) , a company registered in England and Wales (Company Number 07751649), whose registered office is at 25th floor Millbank Tower, 21 – 24 Millbank, London, SW1P 4QP, United Kingdom (United Kingdom).
