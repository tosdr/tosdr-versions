Terms & Conditions of Use
=========================

Last updated: May 25, 2018

#### In English

NationStates is a free online political game. Players should respect the fun, playful atmosphere of the game, and remain civil when interacting with each other. However, this is politics, and there are more players than moderators, so someone may post content that you find objectionable. By continuing, you agree that you understand this, and that NationStates.net is not a publisher and not responsible for posts by players.

Please also note that [the NationStates forums](https://forum.nationstates.net/) sometimes contain discussions of a mature nature and are not suitable for visitors under 13 years of age.
