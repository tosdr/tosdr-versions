Unless expressly authorized by mandatory legislation, the Services may not be copied, reproduced or distributed in any manner or medium, in whole or in part, without prior written consent from North Sky. All rights not expressly granted to you herein are reserved by North Sky.

**The Services and its contents are licensed, not sold.** You agree that you have no right or title in or to any content that appears in the Service, including without limitation the Virtual Items or currency appearing or originating in the Services, whether earned in the Services or purchased from North Sky or third parties.

**3\. Accounts**

When using our Services, you may choose to, and in some instances you will be required to, create an account with us. If you do create an account with us, you agree that you shall take all steps necessary to protect your log in details and keep them secret. You agree that you shall not give your log in details to anyone else or allow anyone else to use your log in details or account. In these terms, references to “log in details” or “account” include your log in details and account for any social network or platform that you may allow our Services to interact with.

We will be entitled to assume that anyone logging into your account using your log in details is either you or someone logging in with your permission. If you fail to keep your login details secret, or if you share your login details or account with someone else (whether intentionally or unintentionally), you accept full responsibility for the consequences of this (including any unauthorized purchases) and agree to fully compensate us for any losses or harm that may result. We will not be responsible to you for any loss that you suffer as a result of an unauthorized person accessing your account and/or using our Services and we accept no responsibility for any losses or harm resulting from its unauthorized use, whether fraudulently or otherwise.

We reserve the right to delete your account if no activity is conducted by you in relation to the account for 180 or more days. In such event, you may no longer be able to access and/or use any Virtual Money and/or Virtual Goods (as defined below) associated with that account and no refund will be offered to you in relation to the same.

Virtual Items do not have an equivalent value in real world money and do not act as a substitute for real world money. Neither North Sky nor any other person or entity has any obligation to exchange Virtual Items for anything of value. North Sky has no liability for hacking or loss of your Virtual Items.

If you do not connect your game play on a device to an account that is linked to your social network account, we will not be able to restore any Virtual Money or other data associated with your Game play to a different device if you lose that device or it is damaged. The data associated with Virtual Items, whether purchased by you or otherwise credited or awarded to you, is then stored locally on your device and so is not synced between different devices.

You may not transfer any of the rights we give you under these terms unless we first agree to this in writing.

If any provision of these Terms of Service is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms of Service will remain in full force and effect.
