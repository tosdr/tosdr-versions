Your privacy is important to us and we encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully so that you can make informed decisions about your use of the Services.

**2\. Collection of Information**

We collect information from a variety of sources, but most of it comes from you when you play our games or interact with our services. The information includes the type of devices you are using, how you play our games as well as information you submit when creating an account with us by connecting to your social networking accounts through our games or Services. We may also collect information from our advertising platforms and partners and other third parties.

This software may record information such as how often you use our games, specific events that occur within the game, performance data, crash reports as well as aggregate usage. We do not link any of that data to any personal information that you submit within the mobile application. We use the data provided to create reports, analysis or similar services for use by us for the purpose or research or business intelligence. For example, we may use analytics to track specific trends within our games or to test out new features and content.

_2.2 Social Networks_

When playing our games, you will be offered the option of connecting with social networks such as Facebook. North Sky Games will then receive information about you from the third-party and use that information to create an account with PlayFab for the game. The account will be linked with the social networking account and will include some personal information such as your first and last name, user ID number (like your Facebook ID number), login email, physical location, friends list as well as any additional information that you or the provider shares with us.

The account created with PlayFab will then periodically save your personal progress within our games. This can include statistics, currencies earned or purchased, unlocked content, level achieved, leaderboards and tournament rewards and any additional information the game needs to fully restore your progress. Connecting a new device to your account will then load your progress unto that device, ensuring that your progress is never lost.

North Sky Games may feature advertising within our games and Services. We use a variety of advertising partners, including ad exchanges, ad networks and ad servers. Our advertising partners help us serve advertisements to you within our games. Our advertising partners may collect information about you when you play our games or the services of others. This privacy policy does not apply to the collection of your information by our advertising partners.

Advertisers on mobile devices use your device’s advertising identifier to optimize their advertising. You can choose to prevent your device’s ad identifier being used for interest-based advertising or you can reset your device’s ad identifier by changing the settings on your device. Settings will vary for each device but will usually be found under privacy or ads in your device’s settings.
