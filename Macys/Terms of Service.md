To the fullest extent allowed by applicable laws, neither macys.com nor its corporate affiliates, nor the directors, officers, employees, agents, contractors, successors or assigns of each, shall be liable for any damages whatsoever arising out of or related to the use of this website, email sent in connection with this website or any other website linked to this website.

macys.com operates an online marketplace that allows a marketplace seller (“Marketplace Seller”) to sell products directly to a customer alongside Macy’s products (“Online Marketplace”). A product offered through the Online Marketplace will say “shipped and sold by \[Marketplace Seller’s Name\]” right below the name of the item on the product page. Once a customer places an order in the Online Marketplace, the Marketplace Seller ships products directly to the customer. The Online Marketplace is subject to the following additional terms:

* Customer acknowledges that, by purchasing a product from the Online Marketplace, the order will be fulfilled by the third-party Marketplace Seller, and not by macys.com. The Marketplace Seller, not macys.com, is responsible for processing, shipping, returns, and customer service related to any Online Marketplace order. A customer may contact the Marketplace Seller by clicking “contact the seller” in the order details section within the customer’s order history page.
* To the fullest extent allowed by applicable laws, neither macys.com nor its corporate affiliates have any responsibility or liability for any Marketplace Seller, its products, or representations made by a Seller in connection with a product offered or sold through the Online Marketplace.

macys.com offers other companies opportunities to advertise their products or services on this site through the Macy’s Media Network. The advertisers are responsible for the content of their ads. Macy’s does not endorse or sponsor the advertisers or the content of their ads.
