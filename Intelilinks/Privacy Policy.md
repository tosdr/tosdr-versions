Exercising Your Rights
----------------------

Depending on where you live, the rights described in this supplement may apply to you. To exercise your rights compatible with applicable law, please submit a verifiable consumer request at [\[email protected\]](https://www.lyrarc.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). 

A.    Verifiable Consumer Requests

Your verifiable consumer request must provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected information, and describe your request in sufficient detail that allows us to properly respond to it. We cannot respond to your request if we cannot verify your identity and confirm that the information relates to you.

Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child. To designate an authorized agent, please contact us via the methods noted above. If you are a California resident, you can designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf only if: (1) the authorized agent is a natural person or a business entity registered with the Secretary of State of California; and (2) you sign a written declaration that you authorize the authorized agent to act on your behalf.  If you use an authorized agent under California law to submit a request to exercise your rights, please have the authorized agent take the following steps in addition to the steps described above:

·      Mail a copy of your signed written declaration authorizing the authorized agent to act on your behalf; and

·      Provide any information we request in our response to your email to verify your identity. The information requested will depend on your prior interactions with us and the sensitivity of the personal information at issue.

If you provide an authorized agent with power of attorney pursuant to California Probate Code sections 4121 to 4130, it may not be necessary to perform these steps and we will respond to any request from such authorized agent in accordance with the CCPA.

California residents may make a verifiable consumer request twice within a 12-month period, free of charge, unless the request is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.  

B.    Response Time

We will respond to verifiable consumer requests within the time allotted under applicable law, generally forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 45 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing in compliance with applicable law.

C.     Response Content

Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance in compliance with applicable law.

D.    Method of Response

You do not need to create an account with us to make a verifiable consumer request. However, if you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.

We took a different way to help millions around the world build educated informed mindsets that affects and shapes their lives. For a future that is open, global and digital, with everyone having access to high quality information. We believe in the renewal of America, renewal of Europe, the renewal of India, the rest of Asia, Latin America and Africa. The renewal of our supply chains, health, education, infrastructure, as we rebuild our countries after the pandemic. Literacy and knowledge we believe cannot thrive and grow in a world of web bots, web crawlers, or AI. This requires human curiosity, human learning, and human imagination. We take as inspiration the saying- “One has to be free, and as broad as sky. One has to have a mind that is crystal clear, only then can truth shine in it.” Every contribution whether big or small is precious- in this crisis and ahead.
