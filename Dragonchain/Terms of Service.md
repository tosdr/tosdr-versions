Dragonchain Terms of Use
------------------------

Welcome to the Dragonchain (“Dragonchain”, “Our”, “Us”, “We”) website (“Site”). From this Site, you or the company or other legal entity for which you have the legal authority to act (each, “You” or “Your”), may set up a user account (“Account”) and purchase licenses to Dragonchain software and development services (“Products”). The Site and the Products available through it are the sole property of Dragonchain. You may only use the Site and the Products if You agree to and comply with these Terms of Use (“Terms”) and any additional terms (“Additional Terms”) applicable to the specific Products You purchase, and Dragonchain’s Privacy Policy located at \[link\] (collectively, the “Terms”).

THESE TERMS CREATE A LEGALLY BINDING CONTRACT BETWEEN YOU AND DRAGONCHAIN. BY CLICKING THE “I ACCEPT” BUTTON WHEN YOU SET UP YOUR ACCOUNT YOU ARE AGREEING TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS. IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE TERMS, YOU SHOULD CONSULT WITH YOUR LEGAL COUNSEL.

IF YOU CHOOSE NOT TO ACCEPT THE TERMS OR BY TECHNICAL MEANS BYPASS/DISABLE THE “I ACCEPT” BUTTON, THEN BY INSTALLING, COPYING, DOWNLOADING, ACCESSING OR OTHERWISE USING THE PRODUCTS AVAILABLE THROUGH THIS SITE YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS.

### Access to the Products

Dragonchain is granting You access to the Site and the Products on the express condition that You agree to and comply with all of the Terms.

YOUR USE OF ANY PAYMENT METHOD, INCLUDING WHERE PERMITTED, ANY CRYPTOCURRENCY, IS AT YOUR OWN RISK AND IS SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND POLICIES APPLICABLE TO SUCH PAYMENT.

### Cancellation; Changes to Subscription Terms

We may cancel or suspend your Subscription at any time with immediate effect if We determine in Our sole discretion that You (a) have acted in a manner inconsistent with applicable laws or ordinances; (b) breached any of the Terms; © engaged in any fraud or abuse concerning Dragons or Your use of them; (d) violated any provision of the applicable Additional Terms; or (e) engaged in any conduct or act for which We may terminate or suspend your access to the Site. We may also take appropriate administrative or legal action if any of the items listed above occurs. Nothing contained in these Terms shall limit Dragonchain in its exercise of any legal or equitable rights or remedies.

If We amend these Terms, We will revise the “last updated” date located at the bottom of these Terms. For changes to these Terms that We consider to be material, We will place a notice on the Site to read substantially as “Updated Terms” with a link to the changes for up to three (3) weeks or some other amount of time that We determine in our discretion. If You continue to use the Site, purchase Dragon tokens (“Dragons”) or Products, or log into your Account or in any other way after these Terms have been changed, You will be deemed to have read, understood and unconditionally consented to and agreed to such changes. The most current version of these Terms will be available on the Site and will supersede all previous versions of these Terms.

### Use of Dragons

Dragons may only be used to purchase Products as provided below. Dragonchain will not redeem them for cash and You represent and warrant that You will not use them to engage in any gambling activity or other activity prohibited by federal, state or local laws, rules or regulations. You may only redeem Dragons as provided in these Terms. Dragons will not be replaced, reissued or credited if lost, stolen or otherwise altered or destroyed. Once You have redeemed your Dragons, there are no refunds, returns or exchanges for additional Dragons, cash, or other goods and services.

### Purchasing Product Licenses and Services

You may purchase licenses to software products (“Software”) and/or development services (“Services”) from the Site by completing the applicable purchase order. By placing a purchase order, You agree to the Additional Terms applicable to the Software or Services covered by the purchase order.

Dragonchain uses a flexible pricing system under which You may purchase Software licenses or Services by using Dragons issued with Your Subscription or by purchasing Dragons for cash or other Payment Method, or using certain Dragonchain-approved cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. You may purchase Dragons when You purchase access to Software or Services, or in advance and use them later to purchase access to Software and Services. However, You need to have an active and current Account to use Dragons to purchase Products from the Site. As a result, if Your Account is canceled for any reason, or if your Subscription terminated, You will no longer be able to use the Dragons associated with Your Account to make purchases from the Site.

Dragons are interchangeable. That is, unless otherwise indicated for specific Software products or Services, during Your Subscription Term You may apply Dragons to any combination of Software and Services available from the Site. However, a specified number of Dragons is required to use the Software and Services and this may change over time, at Dragonchain’s sole option and without prior notice. As a result, the quantity of Software or Services you may purchase with Dragons may increase or decrease.

In addition, the terms applicable to Your use of Dragons may vary depending on the Software or Service You purchase. Before redeeming Dragons for any Software or Service You should review the applicable terms and conditions as set forth in the Additional Terms. We reserve the right to modify, amend or revise the terms applicable to Your use of the Dragons as well as these Terms and the Additional Terms, even though even though these changes may affect Your ability to use the Dragons You have already purchased.

Additional Terms Your right to access and use the Products and this Site is governed by the Terms and, as applicable, the Additional Terms applicable to your purchase, all of which are subject to change in Our sole discretion. The Additional Terms contain limitations on Your use of the Software and Services, including the work product that We may deliver to You as part of the Services. You must comply with all of these limitations and if You fail to do so Dragonchain may terminate or suspend Your access to and use of this Site, the Software and/or Services as provided in these Terms and the applicable Additional Terms. Except as expressly set out herein and in the applicable Additional Terms, Dragonchain retains all rights, including copyright, in the Software, the Services, and related work product and does not grant You any rights or license with respect to any of the above. Dragonchain reserves all rights not expressly granted to You in the Terms and the Additional Terms.
