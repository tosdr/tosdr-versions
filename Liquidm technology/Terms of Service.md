    Any defaults in the delivery of advertising materials by LiquidM have to be reported immediately after inspection, but no later than three (3) working days after completion of the order, otherwise Company’s warranty claims shall be excluded.
    
    In case LiquidM cannot provide the LiquidM Service due to force majeure or any other event outside LiquidM’s control, this has no effect on the contractual conformity of the services provided by LiquidM.

14. ### **Limitation of Liability**
    
    LiquidM shall be liable for damage – regardless of its legal ground – only where Company asserts compensation claims based on intent or gross negligence on the part of LiquidM or its agents or representatives. This shall not apply to liability for assured properties and to the violation of major contractual duties, i.e. such obligations the fulfillment of which enables the proper execution of the contract and the observation of which Company may regularly rely on (“Cardinal Duties”). Where LiquidM is not accused of an intentional or grossly negligent violation of a contract in the case of a violation of  Cardinal Duties, liability for damage shall be limited to the foreseeable damage typically occurring; this shall also apply where Company demands compensation for wasted expenditure instead of damages to compensate for the service.
    
    LiquidM shall not be liable for indirect damage, consequential harm caused by a defect or loss of profit unless LiquidM acted with intent or gross negligence.
    
    All and any of the above limitations of liability shall not apply in the event of personal injury to life, body or health or in the context of mandatory liability in accordance with product liability acts.
    
    The above limitations of liability shall also apply to employees, bodies, representatives, agents and sub-contractors of LiquidM.

    15.2.  **Governing Law.** This Agreement is governed by German law, excluding its conflicts of law rules. The Parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue for all disputes hereunder will be the courts in Berlin, Germany.

Nothing in this Agreement will limit a Party’s ability to seek equitable relief.
    
    15.7.  **Force Majeure.** Neither Party will be liable for any acts or omissions resulting from circumstances or causes beyond its reasonable control.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, LiquidM does not guarantee any LiquidM Service will be operable at all times or during any down time caused by outages to any public Internet backbones, networks or servers, any failures of equipment, systems or local access services, or for previously scheduled maintenance.
    
    15.8.  **Restriction on Resale.** The company may not resell any LiquidM Service, it being understood and agreed that Company’s use of the LiquidM Service hereunder on behalf of advertisers and agencies that Company is authorized to act on behalf of in order to deliver advertising campaigns via the LiquidM Service will not be deemed a breach of this Section.
    
    15.9.  **Counterparts.** The Parties may execute this Agreement in counterparts, including facsimile, PDF and other electronic copies, which taken together will constitute one instrument.
