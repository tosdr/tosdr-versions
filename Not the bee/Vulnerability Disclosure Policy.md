To more fully understand how Google may use the data it collects on the Site please review “How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services” ([located here](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites?hl=en-US) or any successor URL).

Please know that the Site will collect Personal Information about the type of browser, IP address, or type of operating system you are using to assist us and our service providers in providing and maintaining superior quality service. It is the intent of the Site to use Personal Information only for the purpose for which it was requested and any additional uses specifically provided on the Site.

When you visit or log in to our Site, cookies and similar technologies may be used by our online data partners or vendors to associate these activities with other Personal Information they or others have about you, including by association with your email or home address. We (or service providers on our behalf) may then send communications and marketing to these email or home addresses. You may opt out of receiving this advertising by visiting [https://app.retention.com/optout](https://app.retention.com/optout).

The United States has received a finding of “adequacy” from the European Union under Article 45 of the General Data Processing Regulation (GDPR) pursuant to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. The Company relies on certain derogations for specific situations as set forth in Article 49 of the GDPR. In particular, we collect and transfer to the United States Personal Information only: with your consent, to perform a contract with you, or to fulfill a compelling legitimate interest of the Company that does not outweigh your rights and freedoms. We endeavor to apply suitable safeguards to protect the privacy and security of your Personal Information and to use it only consistent with your relationship with the Company and the practices described in this Privacy Policy. We may also enter into data processing agreements and model clauses with our vendors whenever feasible and appropriate.

Glossary

Lawful Basis

**Legitimate Interest** means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your Personal Information for our legitimate interests. We do not use your Personal Information for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us.

**Performance of Contract** means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.

**Comply with a legal obligation** means processing your Personal Information where it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation that we are subject to.

Third Parties

**Internal Third Parties** mean other affiliates of our Company acting as joint controllers or processors and who are based in the United States and provide IT and system administration services and undertake reporting.

**External Third Parties** mean:

* Service providers acting as processors based in the United States who provide IT and system administration services.
* Professional advisers including attorneys, bankers, auditors, and insurers based in the United States who provide consultancy, banking, legal, insurance, and accounting services.
* Marketing providers, including public relations specialists, advertisers, and sales people.
* Payment processing companies based in the United States who provide credit card processing services.

Your Legal Rights

You have the right to:

Request access to your Personal Information (commonly known as a “data subject access request”)

This enables you to receive a copy of the Personal Information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.

This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.

Request erasure of your Personal Information

This enables you to ask us to delete or remove Personal Information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your Personal Information where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your Personal Information to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.

Object to processing of your Personal Information

You have the right to object to processing of your Personal Information in cases where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information, which override your rights and freedoms.

Request restriction of processing of your Personal Information

This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your Personal Information in the following scenarios:

* If you want us to establish the data’s accuracy.
* Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.
* Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.
* You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.

Request the transfer of your Personal Information to you or to a third party

If you request the transfer of your Personal Information we will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your Personal Information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information that you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.

Withdraw consent

You may withdraw your consent at any time where we are relying on consent to process your Personal Information. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
