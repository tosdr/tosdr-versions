**Limitation of Liability**

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL Not the Bee OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, OR ITS OR THEIR RESPECTIVE LICENSORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, MEMBERS, MANAGERS, ATTORNEYS, EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, AGENTS, INSURERS, SUCCESSORS OR ASSIGNS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, UNDER ANY LEGAL THEORY, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SITE INCLUDING ANY OF OUR SOCIAL MEDIA PAGES, ANY WEBSITES LINKED TO IT, OR ANY INFORMATION, SERVICES, PRODUCTS, AND MATERIALS AVAILABLE FROM THE SITE OR SUCH OTHER WEBSITES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, AND INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, PERSONAL INJURY, PAIN AND SUFFERING, EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF REVENUES, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOSS OF DATA, AND WHETHER CAUSED BY TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), BREACH OF CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF Not the Bee HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

ACCORDINGLY, THE FOREGOING DOES NOT AFFECT ANY LIABILITY THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.

**Dispute Resolution and Binding Arbitration**

PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. YOU AND Not the Bee ARE AGREEING TO GIVE UP ANY RIGHTS TO LITIGATE CLAIMS IN A COURT OR BEFORE A JURY, OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO A CLAIM. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT MAY ALSO BE UNAVAILABLE OR MAY BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.

Any controversy, claim, or dispute arising out of or related to these Terms, the Site, or the relationship of the parties, including, but not limited to, alleged violations of state or federal statutory or common law rights or duties (a “**Dispute**”) shall be solely and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration according to the procedures set forth in this paragraph. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE PARTIES HEREBY AGREE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ANY ACTION BY Not the Bee OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES OR SUBSIDIARIES FOR: (i) TRADE SECRET MISAPPROPRIATION; (ii) PATENT INFRINGEMENT; (iii) COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT OR MISUSE; OR (iv) TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT OR DILUTION SHALL NOT BE SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION UNDER THIS SECTION. If we are unable to resolve any Dispute through informal means, either party may initiate binding arbitration of such Dispute. The arbitration shall be initiated and conducted according to the American Arbitration Association Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “**Arbitration Rules**”). The arbitration shall be conducted in Palm Beach County, Florida before a single neutral arbitrator appointed in accordance with the Arbitration Rules. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the arbitrator shall not have the power to award indirect, punitive, special or consequential damages against any party. Arbitration costs and fees shall be determined in accordance with the Arbitration Rules and applicable law. Each party shall be responsible for paying its own attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses, regardless of which party prevails, but a party may recover any or all of its attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses from another party if the arbitrator, applying applicable law, so determines. You agree to arbitration on an individual basis. No Dispute may be arbitrated on a class or representative basis and the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated. The arbitral tribunal has no power to consider the enforceability of this class arbitration waiver and any challenge to the class arbitration waiver may only be raised in a court of competent jurisdiction.

Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator, if any, may be entered for enforcement purposes in any court having jurisdiction thereof. BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO PRESENT A DISPUTE IN COURT, RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, AND ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO JOIN CLAIMS OR DISPUTES WITH THOSE OF OTHERS IN THE FORM OF A CLASS ACTION OR SIMILAR PROCEDURAL DEVICE.

ANY DEMAND FOR ARBITRATION SHALL BE MADE WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME AFTER THE DISPUTE HAS ARISEN, PROVIDED THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OF USE OR THE SITE MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES, OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED TO THE EXTENT NOT OTHERWISE PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

You agree that any claim or controversy excluded from arbitration pursuant to the terms of this provision or determined by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction to be excluded from this Section (“**Excluded Claim**”) shall be governed by the internal laws of the State of Florida, without giving effect to any choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Florida or any other jurisdictions) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdictions other than the State of Florida. You hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts sitting in Palm Beach County, Florida, for the adjudication of any Excluded Claim, and hereby irrevocably waive, and agree not to assert in any suit, action or proceeding, any claim that you are not personally subject to the jurisdiction of any such court, that such suit, action or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum or that the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed or operate to preclude a party from bringing suit or taking other legal action against the other party in any other jurisdiction to enforce a judgment or other court ruling in favor of such party.

**No Waiver**

Not the Bee’s failure to enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms of Use will not constitute a waiver of Not the Bee’s right to subsequently enforce such a provision or any other provision of these Terms of Use, nor will any delay or omission on the part of Not the Bee to exercise or take advantage of any right or remedy that Not the Bee has or may have hereunder, operate as a waiver of any right or remedy.

**Severability**

In the event that any of the provisions of these Terms shall be held by a court, arbitrator or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining portion hereof shall remain in full force and effect and such a provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent possible so as to effect the intent of the parties and shall be reformed to the extent necessary to make such provisions valid and enforceable.

**Modification**

Not the Bee, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to update, revise, supplement and otherwise modify these Terms of Use, and to impose new or additional terms and conditions on your use of the Site from time to time. Such updates, revisions, supplements, modifications and additional rules, policies, terms and conditions will be effective immediately upon posting to the Site, and shall apply to all access to and use of the Site thereafter. However, any changes to the dispute resolution provisions set out in Governing Law and Jurisdiction will not apply to any disputes for which the parties have actual notice on or before the date the change is posted on the Site. You agree to review the Terms upon each visit to the Site. Your continued use of the Site following the posting of revised Terms of Use will be deemed to conclusively indicate your acceptance of the revised Terms.

**Entire Agreement**

The Terms of Use, our [Privacy Policy](https://notthebee.com/privacy) , our [Privacy Notice for California Residents](https://notthebee.com/california-privacy), and our [Terms and Conditions For Online Sales](https://notthebee.com/online-sales-terms) constitute the sole and entire agreement between you and Not the Bee regarding the Site and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations, and warranties, both written and oral, regarding the Site. In the event that any provision contained in the Terms of Use conflicts with any provision in the [Privacy Policy](https://notthebee.com/privacy) (including our [Privacy Notice for California Residents](https://notthebee.com/california-privacy)), the provision most favorable to Not the Bee shall govern and control.
