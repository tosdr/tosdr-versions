What is instance privacy?
-------------------------

Instance privacy aims to bring transparency to the data collected by frontends and encourage privacy friendly practices. There is often no privacy policy and users are forced to trust that the instance operator is not collecting data. However, there is a possibility that the instance operator can put false information so we encourage looking at other factors when selecting an instance.
