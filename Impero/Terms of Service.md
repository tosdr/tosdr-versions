### 10\. Intellectual Property

1. **Pre-existing.** Each party shall retain exclusive ownership of all patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and any other proprietary intellectual property rights (“**Intellectual Property**”) created, authored, or invented by it prior to the commencement of the Services. If you provide Impero with your pre-existing Intellectual Property (“**Customer IP**”), then you hereby grant to Impero, during the term of your use of the Services, a limited, worldwide, non-transferable, royalty-free, right and license (with right of sub-license where required to perform the Services) to use the Customer IP solely for the purpose of providing the Services. You represent and warrant that you have all rights in the Customer IP necessary to grant this license, and that Impero’s use of such Customer IP shall not infringe on the Intellectual Property rights of any third party.

3. **Created by Impero.** Excluding any Customer IP, Impero shall own all Intellectual Property created as part of providing the Services or contained in the Software. By virtue of your use of the Services, Impero grants to you, during the term of your rightful use, a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, right and license (without the right to sublicense) to use any products, and any Intellectual Property (including Device Agents, but excluding any Third Party Software), provided to you by Impero as part of the Services for your internal use as necessary for you to enjoy the benefit of the Services.

Impero makes no representation or warranty regarding Third Party Software except that Impero has the right to use or provide the Third-Party Software and that we are in material compliance with the applicable license.

7. If the delivery of the Services infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party and Impero determines that it is not reasonably or commercially practicable to obtain the right to use the infringing element, or modify the Services or Software such that they do not infringe, then Impero may terminate the Order on written notice and will not have any liability on account of such termination except to refund amounts paid for unused Services (prorated as to portions of Software or Services deemed infringing).
