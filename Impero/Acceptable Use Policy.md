or passively).

• Not to use the Services in a manner that infringes on or misappropriates the rights of a third

Interactive services



We may from time to time provide interactive services on our site, including, without limitation:

• Discussion groups.

• Bulletin boards.

We will do our best to assess any possible risks for users from third parties when they use any

interactive service provided on our site, and we will decide in each case whether it is appropriate

to use moderation of the relevant service (including what kind of moderation to use) in the light

of those risks. However, we are under no obligation to oversee, monitor or moderate any

interactive service we provide on our site, and we expressly exclude our liability for any loss or

damage arising from the use of any interactive service by a user in contravention of our content

standards, whether the service is moderated or not.



Code of Conduct



When using the interactive services we expect all users to comply with the following code of

conduct:

• Respect others. Focus on the content of posts and not on the people making them. Please

extend the benefit of the doubt to newer guests and members; there’s no such thing as a stupid

question.

• Respect the purpose of the community. Use the community to share successes,

challenges, constructive feedback, questions, and goals instead of promote products or services

3



that you provide. If you’ve found a product or service helpful, please share your experience with

the group in a respectful way.

• Use caution when discussing products. Information posted on the discussion groups and

in the libraries is available for all to see, and comments are subject to libel, slander, and antitrust

laws.

• All defamatory, abusive, profane, threatening, offensive, or illegal materials are strictly

prohibited. Do not post anything that you would not want the world to see or that you would not

want anyone to know came from you.

• Respect intellectual property. Post content that you have personally created or have

permission to use and have properly attributed to the content creator.

• Post your message or documents only to the most appropriate communities. This helps

ensure all messages receive the best response by eliminating "noise."



Discussion Group Etiquette

When participating in discussion groups on our site you should:

• state concisely and clearly the topic of your comments in the subject line. This allows

members to respond more appropriately to your posting and makes it easier for members to

search the archives by subject;

• send messages such as "thanks for the information" or "me, too" to individuals, not to the

entire list. Do this by using the "Reply to Sender" link in every message; and

• not send administrative messages, such as “remove me from the list,” to the group.

Instead, use the web interface to change your settings or to remove yourself from a list. If you are

changing email addresses, you do not need to remove yourself from the list and rejoin under your

new email address. Simply change your settings in your profile.



Content standards



These content standards apply to any and all material which you contribute to our site

(“Contribution”) and to any interactive services associated with it.

understand as a direct or indirect encouragement or other inducement to the commission,

preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism.

• Contain any advertising or promote any services or web links to other sites.

We may update this AUP over time as we deem necessary and appropriate in response to legal

or regulatory changes, technology advances, or as we identify new forms of behaviour which

pose a risk to our users, shared systems, or is inconsistent with our or our customer’s legal

obligations.
