Tipard Studio is committed to providing you with the highest level of protection for your data and privacy. We only collect data when it's truly necessary, and in our customers' best interests, e.g.: to send you a product activation code via email. By no means will the collected data be sold or for any other reason given to third parties. The following statement give you an overview of how we ensure this protection and what kind of data is being collected for what purpose.

### Website

You can visit most areas of the Tipard website without disclosing any personal information.

Tipard only logs the domain name, IP address and browser type of our website visitors via our web server log files and analytics tools at irregular intervals. We use this information to log global access to our website.

For certain features we will ask that you provide Tipard certain information so that it works properly. You can decide at any time whether you would like to continue with an instruction prompting you to provide information. In some cases, you will be unable to complete a particular step in the process if you do not want to provide the information requested. For example, we will ask for personal information in the following instances:

• If you place an order through our online store, we will ask you to provide information required for processing the order. This may include your name, address, email address, and credit card number or bank details.  
• If you subscribe to a newsletter. If you signed up for a newsletter and no longer want to receive it, you can unsubscribe at any time by using the unsubscribe option provided in the email or by sending us an email using the contact information provided below.

### Cookies

Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer or in your browser. Cookies are loaded on your browser when you first use a product or service. Cookies do not include any personal information. We may use cookies to identify the browser you are using so that our website displays properly. We also use cookies in various places on our website in order to document your visit to the Tipard website and allow for a more efficient website design. If you do not want to allow Tipard or someone else to use cookies, you can disable cookie installation via your browser setting. While you also have the option of deleting cookies from your computer's hard disk at any time, if you choose to do so, you may be unable to use some of the features of our website, products and services.

### eCommerce

Tipard uses secure server hosted by MYCOMMERCE and other 3rd party credit card processors that encrypt the entire customer's personal information including name, address, credit card number credit card expiration date etc. before it is sent to us. Encryption works to prevent any malicious use of your personal information.

You can help us by also taking precautions to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet. Change your passwords often using a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure web browser like Safari.

• To secure your information in transmission we use Secure Sockets Layer software (SSL) where needed. This software encrypts the information you submit.  
• Of course this is also true for credit card payments. The credit card information is only stored temporarily and deleted after being handed on to the respective payment provider.  
• It is important for you to take precautions against unauthorized access to your password and your computer. If you share your computer with others, you should remember to always log off after each session.

### 2Checkout

2Checkout specializes in providing software companies scalable distribution solutions for selling their products worldwide. Tipard Studio uses 2Checkout to offer you a fast and safe solution to purchasing our products online.

You can have your data deleted at any time. We use your data only to process your order, i.e. only information implicitly necessary for possible claims for reimbursement is collected and handled.

### Software Installation and Activation

Activation, trial extension and unlocking of free software is achieved through an activation routine at program launch. This process requires purchased email address and a license key.

Activation of a full version software requires an active Internet connection. During the process, a connection to a licensing server is established and a validity check performed. Invalid licenses / license keys or keys that have been used multiple times will result in the display of a licensing error in the program that will disappear once the program has been activated successfully. The validity of a product license will be automatically checked online at regular intervals.

The following information is transmitted when you activate a program with a license key:

• The license key  
• A checksum  
• The product code  
• The version numbers

### Screen Recording Data

Your Screen Recording Data that you create using our software are stored locally on your device. We do not collect, upload any recording data, or share them with any third parties. You are responsible for the security and management of any Personal Information contained in your Screen Recording Data.
