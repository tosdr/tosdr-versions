#### Cookies

We use "cookies" (small files placed on your hard drive) on certain of our pages to help analyze our web page flow; customize our services, content and advertising; measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety. A few important things you should know about cookies are that:

* We offer certain features that are available only through the use of cookies.
* We use cookies to help identify you and maintain your signed-in status.
* Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session.
* You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although doing so may interfere with your use of some of our sites or services.
* You may encounter cookies from third parties on certain pages of the sites that we do not control.

Google Analytics generates statistical and other information about website use by means of cookies, which are stored on users' computers.

#### Accessing, Reviewing and Changing Your Personal Information

You can see, review and change most of your personal information by signing on the website. Generally, we will not manually modify your personal information because it is very difficult to verify your identity remotely. You must promptly update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate. Once you make a public posting, you may not be able to change or remove it. Upon your request, we will close your account and remove your personal information from view as soon as reasonably possible, based on your account activity and in accordance with applicable law. We do retain personal information from closed accounts to comply with law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our website Terms & Conditions and take other actions otherwise permitted by the law of the Country.

#### Security

Your information is stored on our servers in a secured location of Grameenphone Ltd. We treat data as an asset that must be protected and use lots of tools (encryption, passwords, physical security, etc.) to protect your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure. However, as you probably know, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, and other users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the site. Therefore, although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.

#### Third Parties

Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document addresses only the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. If you disclose your information to others, whether they are bidders, buyers or sellers on our or other sites throughout the internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. [www.grameenphone.com](http://www.grameenphone.com/) does not control the privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.

#### General

If your questions are not answered in the website, you may write to us at [info@grameenphone.com](mailto:info@grameenphone.com) or Grameenphone Ltd, GP House, Bashundhara , Baridhara, Dhaka-1229, Bangladesh or contact our hotline 121 only from your GP number.

Please check GP [Privacy Notice](https://www.grameenphone.com/privacy-notice) for our key privacy principles and other relevant information.

#### Social Media Data

* In order to provide services through social media platforms, we analyze user queries and other information that we receive directly from those platforms.
