Switch is obliged by law to install, administer and maintain a publicly accessible subscriber directory service (services Whois and domain name search, hereinafter Services), which allows all interested persons (hereinafter User) access to personal data relating to domain names (Art. 10 sec. 1 lit. a para. 5 of the Ordinance on Internet Domains of 5 November 2014, SR 784.104.2, hereinafter VID). With respect to the processing of personal data, Switch is subject to the provisions of Art. 16 ff. of the data protection act SR 232.1 (hereinafter DSG). To prevent abuse of the personal data from the Services, Switch is also obliged to restrict access to the Servi�ces, i.e. to limit internet users to a number of data accesses per unit of time.

Requests for and processing of personal data from the Services are subject in particular to article 12 ff. DSG.

### 2\. Permissible use

The User is allowed to use requests to the Services only for the following purposes:

* **to check whether a domain name is already registered or not**
* **to examine data on a domain name to identify the holder of the domain name.**

### 3\. Unauthorised use

The User is not permitted to use or to process the data from the Services for more far-reaching purposes or purposes other than those mentioned above in Section 2. This includes, in particular commercial purposes such as sale of addresses, advertising purposes, market research, troubling the holders of domain names or for any other abusive purposes.

Processing refers to any operation with the data, regardless of the means and methods used, in particular the acquisition, storage, use, adaptation, disclosure, such as providing access to personal data, allowing inspection, forwarding, reproduction or publication, archiving, deletion or transmission of data to other countries.

### 4\. Access restrictions

For security reasons, the number of accesses to the Services is restricted. Increased access to the Services will be granted to third parties only on the basis of a special agreement and only in so far as increased access is required for activities of the third party in connection with the allocation and administration of domain names.

### 5\. Responsibility/liability

Switch does not give any assurance, guarantee or other undertaking with respect to the use of the Services for the purposes of the User. In particular, Switch is not liable for formatting suitable for the purposes of the User, the accuracy or completeness of the content of the data, for interruptions in access or for transmission faults. For domain names that were registered before 24.11.1999, there shall be no guarantee with respect to the indication of the date of first registration.

All other liability of Switch, its executives, employees and agents in connection with the Services and this AUP is excluded in so far as permitted by law.

The User is responsible and liable for complying with the data protection regulations when using the Services and processing the relevant personal data. Unsolicited advertising messages sent on the basis of personal data from the Services, either electronically or by mail, are furthermore qualified as unfair competition according to the established practice of the Swiss Unfair Trading Commission (Schweizerische Lauterkeitskommission). In addition, the User of the Services is bound by any other legal provisions.
