All User Contributions must comply with the Content Standards set out in these Terms of Use.

Any User Contribution you post to the Website will be considered non-confidential and non-proprietary. By providing any User Contribution on the Website, you grant Renaissance and its affiliates and service providers, and each of their licensees, successors and assigns the right to use, reproduce, modify, create derivative works, perform, display, distribute and otherwise disclose to third parties any such material for any purpose.

You represent and warrant that:

* You own or control all rights in and to the User Contributions and have the right to grant the license granted above to Renaissance and Renaissance’s affiliates and service providers, and each of their licensees, successors and assigns.
* All of your User Contributions do and will comply with these Terms of Use.

You understand and acknowledge that you are responsible for any User Contributions you submit or contribute, and you, not Renaissance, have fully responsibility for such content, including its legality, reliability, accuracy and appropriateness.

Renaissance is not responsible, or liable to any third party, for the content or accuracy of any User Contributions posted by you or any other user of the Website.

Content standards
-----------------

These Content Standards apply to any and all User Contributions and use of Interactive Services. User Contributions must in their entirety comply with all applicable federal, state, local and international laws and regulations. Without limiting the foregoing, User Contributions must not:

* Contain any material which is defamatory, obscene, indecent, abusive, offensive, harassing, violent, hateful, inflammatory or otherwise objectionable.
* Promote sexually explicit or pornographic material, violence, or discrimination based on race, sex, religion, nationality, disability, sexual orientation or age.
* Infringe any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright or other intellectual property or other rights of any other person.

* Give the impression that they emanate from or are endorsed by us or any other person or entity, if this is not the case.

Monitoring and enforcement
--------------------------

Renaissance has no obligation to review any User Contribution and does not undertake to review material before it is posted on the Website. As such, Renaissance cannot ensure prompt removal of objectionable material after it has been posted. Accordingly, we assume no liability for any action or inaction regarding transmissions, communications or content provided by any user or third party. We have no liability or responsibility to anyone for performance or nonperformance of the activities described in this section.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Renaissance has the right to:

* Remove or refuse to post any User Contributions for any or no reason in its sole discretion.
* Take any action with respect to any User Contribution that Renaissance deems necessary or appropriate in its sole discretion, including if Renaissance believes that such User Contribution violates the Terms of Use, including the Content Standards, infringes any intellectual property right or other right of any person or entity, threatens the personal safety of users of the Website or the public or could create liability for the Company.
* Disclose your identity or other information about you to any third party who claims that material posted by you violates their rights, including their intellectual property rights or their right to privacy.
* Take appropriate legal action, including without limitation, referral to law enforcement, for any illegal or unauthorized use of the Website.
* Terminate or suspend your access to all or part of the Website for any or no reason, including without limitation, any violation of these Terms of Use.

Without limiting the foregoing, Renaissance has the right to fully cooperate with any law enforcement authorities or court order requesting or directing Renaissance to disclose the identity or other information of anyone posting any materials on or through the Website. YOU WAIVE AND HOLD HARMLESS RENAISSANCE AND ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSEES AND SERVICE PROVIDERS FROM ANY CLAIMS RESULTING FROM ANY ACTION TAKEN BY ANY OF THE FOREGOING PARTIES DURING OR AS A RESULT OF ITS INVESTIGATIONS AND FROM ANY ACTIONS TAKEN AS A CONSEQUENCE OF INVESTIGATIONS BY SUCH PARTIES OR LAW ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITIES.

Products and tools
------------------

For your convenience, Renaissance may make available on the Website products, tools and utilities for use and/or download (the “Tools”). Renaissance does not make any assurances with regard to the accuracy of the results or output that derives from such use of any such Tools. The Tools are copyrighted works of Renaissance and/or its suppliers, and are protected by copyright law and international treaty provisions. If a Tool is accompanied by an end user license agreement, your use of that Tool is governed by the terms of such end user license agreement, and you must agree to the terms and conditions of such end user license agreement in order to install and use such Tool. If a Tool is not accompanied by a license agreement, Renaissance hereby grants to you a revocable, personal, non-transferable license to use such Tool in accordance with these Terms of Use and for no other purpose. Without limiting the foregoing, any reproduction, redistribution, reverse engineering or decompilation of the Website or the Tools is expressly prohibited by law, unless such action is expressly permitted by the accompanying license agreement, and may result in severe civil and criminal penalties. You agree not to redistribute the Tools, nor to export or re-export the Tools, directly or indirectly, to any countries that are subject to USA export restrictions. You may not use the Tools to defame, abuse, harass, threaten or otherwise violate the legal rights of others. You may not use the Tools in association with the sale of any service or product which is discriminatory, obscene, defamatory, indecent or unlawful, or which in the reasonable opinion of Renaissance, would reflect negatively upon the reputation of Renaissance, the Website or the Tools.
