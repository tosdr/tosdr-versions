**1\. General Provisions**  
**What is a cookie?**  
A cookie is a small amount of data with information about a site visit, which is sent to your browser from the site you are visiting. Each website or third party service provider used by the website may send its own cookie to your browser if your browser settings allow it. Your browser allows the website or third-party service provider to access the cookies it contains. The cookie contains anonymous information about the unique identifier and the name of the site, this allows the website to remember your preferences or what, for example, is in your shopping cart.  
**What is a browser?**  
A browser is a program that is designed to search and view information from the Internet. Most browsers are safe and offer quick and easy ways to delete information such as cookies.  
You can choose how your device handles cookies in your browser settings. The most popular browsers allow you to choose the following settings:  
a) Accept all cookies;  
b) Notify of the release of the cookie;  
c) Not receive cookies at any time.  
Please note that blocking all cookies will have a negative impact on the use of many websites. If you block cookies, you will not be able to use all the functions on our website. If you decide to change your browser settings, please check the Help menu of your browser to find out how to change your cookie settings.  
**Cookies and Personal Information**  
Cookies usually do not contain information that personally identifies the user, but the personal information that you provide may be associated with information stored and obtained from cookies. A cookie is unique to your browser and can only be read by the server that provided it to you.  
If We can correlate the data from the cookie with a specific Subject, the cookies are considered as personal data. The legal basis for such processing of data from cookies is the fulfillment of contractual obligations to you under the License Agreement ([https://law.2gis.ru/licensing-agreement/](https://law.2gis.ru/licensing-agreement/)). In other cases, the data from the cookie is not personal data.
