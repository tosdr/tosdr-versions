Before resorting to these alternatives, we strongly encourage You to first contact us directly to seek a resolution by contacting us. We will consider reasonable requests to resolve the dispute through alternative dispute resolution procedures, such as mediation or arbitration, as alternatives to litigation.

Law and Forum for Legal Disputes - This Agreement (the Terms) is governed in all respects by the laws of the State of Nevada and controlling U.S. federal law, without regard to conflict of law provisions. You agree that any Claim or dispute You may have against SearchItWithUs, or SearchItWithUs may have against You, must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in Washoe County, Nevada, USA, except as otherwise agreed by the parties or as described in the Arbitration Option paragraph below. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts (and arbitrators) located within Washoe County, Nevada, USA, for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.

Arbitration Option - Although Section 12 regarding Your remedies governs, for any claim (excluding claims by SearchItWithUs for injunctive or other equitable relief) where the total amount of the award sought is less than $10,000, the party requesting relief may elect to resolve the dispute in a cost effective manner through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. In the event a party elects arbitration, they will initiate such arbitration through an established alternative dispute resolution ("ADR") provider mutually agreed upon by the parties. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: (a) the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online, and/or solely based on written submissions, the specific manner will be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration; (b) the arbitration will not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties; and (c) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If we are unable to agree upon an ADR provider then the default ADR provider will be the American Arbitration Association, JAMS, or Judicate West, as decided by the party submitting the claim for arbitration.

Improperly Filed Claims - All claims You bring against SearchItWithUs must be resolved in accordance with this Legal Disputes Section. All claims filed or brought contrary to this Dispute Resolution Section will be considered improperly filed. Should You file a claim contrary to this Dispute Resolution Section, SearchItWithUs may recover attorneys' fees and costs up to $1,000, provided that SearchItWithUs has notified You of the improperly filed claim, and You have failed to promptly withdraw the claim.
