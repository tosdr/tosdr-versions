📱 **Terms and Conditions**
---------------------------

#### LAST UPDATE AS OF 1 AUGUST 2023

Terms and Conditions are a set of rules and guidelines that a user must agree to in order to use Torox Site. It acts as a legal contract between Torox and the each user who access website.

##### General

Torox provides a service that enables web users to obtain virtual currency, which may be used for various websites, online games, social applications, social networks and other similar online applications by either earning (by completing offers) or purchasing such virtual currency.

Torox's offers and advertisers are carefully selected in order to make sure your users are engaging with safe and honest merchants. In return we expect the same fairness from you. Please respect the following rules, so we may continue to provide you with quality offers

##### Fraudulent activity

As a publisher, it is your responsibility to prevent fraud in your app. In the case of fraud, we reserve the right to charge-back those commissions or even ban the publisher's account. The use of proxy servers is strictly forbidden as well as any other form of faking an offer completion.

Torox audits every Publisher's traffic on a daily basis. Publishers that produce or commit blatant fraudulent activities, will have their account permanently banned from our network and will not be compensated for the fraudulent conversions.

##### Payments

Payments are sent once a month to our publishers on a net-30 base. Payments can be done via either PayPal or a Bank transfer. The minimum payout threshold is $200 for PayPal and Bank transfers. It is the responsibility of the publisher to enter valid payment information.

If the publisher has crossed the threshold but has not entered their payment information/entered invalid information, EagleTech LTD will try to contact the publisher for 3 months, after which we will not contact the publisher regarding payments.

The earnings will be available once the publisher has entered their information.

##### Taxes

It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the commission you earn from Torox. It is solely your responsibility to assess, collect, report, or remit the correct tax to the proper tax authority. We are not obligated to, nor will we determine whether Taxes apply, or calculate, collect, report, or remit any Taxes to any tax authority arising from any commission sent by Torox.

##### Termination

Torox reserves the right to terminate any Publisher's relationship with the Torox Network at any time, with or without cause. Termination notice may be provided via email or any other public means and will be effective immediately.
