This Statement applies to information we collect:

It does not apply to information collected:

* By any third party, including through any application or content (including advertising) that may link to or be accessible from the System.

This Statement does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information or other practices of any third parties, and the inclusion of a link on the System does not imply endorsement of the linked site or service by us or by our affiliates.  In addition, we are not responsible for the information collection, use, disclosure, or security policies or practices of other organizations, such as Facebook, Apple, Google, Microsoft, RIM, or any other app developer, app provider, operating system provider, wireless service provider, or device manufacturer, including with respect to any Personal Information you disclose to other organizations through or in connection with our apps.

Please read this Statement carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it. This Statement may change from time to time.

We need to collect Personal Information in order to provide the requested services to you.  If you do not provide the information requested, we may not be able to provide the services. If you disclose any Personal Information relating to other people to us or to our service providers in connection with the System, you represent that you have the authority to do so and to permit us to use the information in accordance with this Statement.

### OTHER INFORMATION WE COLLECT THROUGH AUTOMATIC DATA COLLECTION TECHNOLOGIES

* Details of your visits to our System, including traffic data, app usage data, and other communication data and the resources that you access and use on the System.
* Information about your computer and internet connection, including your IP address, operating system, and browser type.

The Other Information we collect helps us to improve our System and products, and to deliver a better and more personalized service, including by enabling us to:

* Store information about your preferences, allowing us to customize our System according to your individual interests.
* Speed up your searches.
* Recognize you when you return to our System.
* Improve our products.
* Improve our ability to service and sell our products.

If we are required to treat Other Information as Personal Information under applicable law, then we may use and disclose it for the purposes for which we use and disclose Personal Information as detailed in this Policy.

We may use and disclose Other Information for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law.  In some instances, we may combine Other Information with Personal Information.  If we do, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information as long as it is combined.

### COLLECTION OF OTHER INFORMATION

We and our service providers may collect Other Information in a variety of ways, including:

**Through your browser or device**

Certain information is collected by most browsers or automatically through your device, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Mac), screen resolution, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, language, Internet browser type, and version and the name and version of the Services (such as the App) you are using.  We use this information to ensure that the Services function properly.

**Through your use of apps**

When you download and use apps, we and our service providers may track and collect app usage data, such as the date and time the app on your device accesses our servers and what information and files have been downloaded to the app based on your device number.

**Cookies (or browser cookies) and web beacons**

A cookie is a small file placed on the hard drive of your computer.  Cookies are pieces of information stored directly on the computer that you are using.  Cookies allow us to collect information such as browser type, time spent on the System, pages visited, language preferences, and other traffic data.  We and our service providers use the information for security purposes, to facilitate navigation, to display information more effectively, and to personalize your experience.  We also gather statistical information about use of the System in order to continually improve their design and functionality, understand how they are used, and assist us with resolving questions regarding them.  Cookies further allow us to select which of our advertisements or offers are most likely to appeal to you and display them while you are on the System.  We may also use cookies or other technologies in online advertising to track responses to our ads.  We do not currently respond to browser do-not-track signals.

You may refuse to accept browser cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser. You may also wish to refer to [http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html).  However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our System. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you direct your browser to our System.

Pixel tags (also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) may be used to, among other things, track the actions of users of the System (including email recipients), measure the success of our marketing campaigns, and compile statistics about usage of the System and response rates.

Generac uses industry standard web analytics to track web visits, Google Analytics and Adobe Analytics.  The information generated by the cookie about your use of our System (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google and Adobe on servers in the United States. Google and Adobe will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of our websites, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage.  Google and Adobe may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google’s or Adobe’s behalf.

You may opt out of web analytics by installing these tools on your computer:

[Google Analytics Opt Out Link](https://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin)

[Adobe Analytics Opt Out Link](http://www.adobe.com/privacy/opt-out.html)

**Adobe Flash technology (including Flash Local Shared Objects (“Flash LSOs”)) and other similar technologies**   

We may use Flash LSOs and other technologies to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of the Services.  If you do not want Flash LSOs stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash LSO storage using the tools contained in the Website Storage Settings Panel.  You can also go to the Global Storage Settings Panel and follow the instructions (which may explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash LSOs (referred to as “information”), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and  how to block Flash LSOs that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time).  Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash LSOs may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications.

**IP Address**

Your IP address is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider.  An IP address may be identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user accesses the System, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited.  Collecting IP addresses is standard practice and is done automatically by many websites, applications, and other services.  We use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating usage levels, diagnosing server problems, and administering the System.  We may also derive your approximate location from your IP address.

**Physical Location**

We may collect the physical location of your device by, for example, using satellite, cell phone tower, or WiFi signals.  We may use your device’s physical location to provide you with personalized location-based services and content.  We may also share your device’s physical location, combined with information about what advertisements you viewed and other information we collect, with our marketing partners to enable them to provide you with more personalized content and to study the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.  In some instances, you may be permitted to allow or deny such uses and/or sharing of your device’s location, but if you do, we and/or our marketing partners may not be able to provide you with the applicable personalized services and content.

### DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION

We may disclose aggregated information about our users, and information that does not identify any individual, without restriction.  Sometimes we may “anonymize” consumer information by removing any identifier that can be associated with your Personal Information.  Anonymous Personal Information helps us develop reports and analyses about how our customers use our System and for other research.  We may publicly share or sell anonymous Personal Information and reports and analyses based on anonymous Personal Information.  We may disclose aggregated, anonymous Personal Information, and analyses and reports derived from such information to third parties including our service providers, suppliers, advertisers, merchants, consumer and market research companies, and other organizations.

* To third-party sponsors of sweepstakes, contests and similar promotions.
* To third parties, to permit them to send you marketing communications, consistent with your choices.

You also may elect to provide Personal Information to be published or displayed (hereinafter, “posted”) on public areas of the System, or transmitted to other users of the System or third parties (collectively, “User Contributions”). Additionally, we cannot control the actions of other users of the System with whom you may choose to share your User Contributions. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that your User Contributions will not be viewed by the general public.

We may also use and disclose your Personal Information as necessary or appropriate, especially when we have a legal obligation or legitimate interest to do so:

If the System is distributed by a dealer, contractor, retailer, or other third party and you share your Personal Information with such party, we cannot control and are not responsible for the collection, storage, disclosure, and use of your information by such party.  If the System is provided through a third party System provider, we may share Personal Information with the third party System provider in accordance with your agreement with such third party System provider.  In some circumstances, we may share your Personal Information with third parties upon your request; in such event we cannot control and are not responsible for the collection, storage, disclosure, and use of your information by such party. In these circumstances, such parties’ obligations with respect to such Personal Information are governed by their agreement with you.

### DATA INTEGRITY AND RETENTION

Generac will take reasonable steps to confirm that Personal Information about you is accurate, complete, and up-to date.  We retain Personal Information for as long as needed or permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which it was obtained and consistent with applicable law.  The criteria used to determine our retention periods include:

* The length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide the System to you (for example, for as long as you have an account with us or keep using the System);
* Whether there is a legal obligation to which we are subject (for example, certain laws require us to keep records of your transactions for a certain period of time before we can delete them); or
* Whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation, or regulatory investigations).

### CHOICES AND ACCESS

Users of our System in certain jurisdictions may have rights in relation to the Personal Information that we collect about them.  If you would like to request to review, correct, update, suppress, restrict, or delete Personal Information, object to the processing of Personal Information, or if you would like to request to receive an electronic copy of your Personal Information for purposes of transmitting it to another company (to the extent this right to data portability is provided to you by applicable law), you may contact us by email at [legal.admin@generac.com](mailto:legal.admin@generac.com) or by mailing our Legal Department at S45 W29290 Hwy. 59, Waukesha, WI 53189.  We will respond to your request consistent with applicable law.

In your request, please make clear what Personal Information you would like to have changed, and whether you would like to have your Personal Information suppressed from our database.  For your protection, we may only implement requests with respect to the Personal Information associated with the particular email address that you use to send us your request, and we may need to verify your identity before implementing your request.  We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable.

Please note that we may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to requesting a change or deletion (e.g., when you make a purchase or enter a promotion, you may not be able to change or delete the Personal Information provided until after the completion of such purchase or promotion).

If you are a resident of California, under 18, and a registered user of the System, you may ask us to remove content or information that you have posted to the System by writing to [legal.admin@generac.com](mailto:legal.admin@generac.com).  Please note that your request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information, as, for example, some of your content may have been reposted by another user.

When you provide us with Personal Information through our Website or product registration, you may be offered the opportunity to subscribe to and receive additional information about our products and services via e-mail. After your first use, you can change your initial choice by opting out of future e-mails or contacting customer service. Each commercial e-mail that we send to you will offer you the opportunity to opt-out of continuing to receive such messages. We may take up to ten (10) business days to process your opt-out requests.

### DATA SECURITY

Generac uses a variety of reasonable security technologies and procedures to help protect your Personal Information and the System from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.  For example, we store the Personal Information you provide on computer systems with limited access that are located in facilities to which access is limited.  For sites to which you log in, it is your responsibility to ensure the security of your password and not to reveal this information to others.  When you move around a site to which you have logged in, or from one site to another that uses the same login mechanism, we verify your identity by means of an encrypted cookie placed on your machine.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Generac cannot guarantee that the System or your Personal Information cannot be compromised or hacked.  If you have specific security-related concerns, please contact our [Customer Support](https://www.generac.com/service-support/contact-us/online-form).

### THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING

We use third-party advertising companies to serve advertisements regarding goods and services that may be of interest to you when you access and use the System and other websites or online services.

You may receive advertisements based on information relating to your access to and use of the System and other websites or online services on any of your devices, as well as on information received from third parties.  These companies place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser (including through the use of pixel tags).  They also use these technologies, along with information they collect about your online use, to recognize you across the devices you use, such as a mobile phone and a laptop.  If you would like more information about this practice, and to learn how to opt out of it in desktop and mobile browsers on the particular device on which you are accessing this Privacy Policy, please visit [http://optout.aboutads.info/#/](http://optout.aboutads.info/#/) and [http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#/](http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#/).   You may download the AppChoices app at www.aboutads.info/appchoices to opt out in mobile apps.

### THIRD PARTY PAYMENT SERVICE

We may use a third-party payment service to process payments made through the System.  If you wish to make a payment through the System, your Personal Information will be collected by such third party and not by us, and will be subject to the third party’s privacy policy, rather than this Statement.  We have no control over, and are not responsible for, this third party’s collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information.

### SENSITIVE INFORMATION

Unless we request it, we ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive Personal Information (e.g., social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background or trade union membership) on or through the System or otherwise to us.

### JURISDICTION AND CROSS-BORDER TRANSFER

The System is hosted in the United States and is subject to United States law. We may share your Personal Information internally with our affiliates and other recipients, as described in this Statement, and they may be located in countries other than your country. If you are accessing the System from outside the United States, please be advised that the United States and other countries may not offer the same privacy protections as the law of your jurisdiction.  In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in those other countries may be entitled to access your Personal Information.

Discrimination may exist where a business denies or provides a different level or quality of goods or services, or charges (or suggests that it will charge) different prices,  rates, or penalties on residents who exercise their CCPA rights, unless doing so is reasonably related to the value provided to the business by the residents’ data.

**Financial Incentives**

A business may offer financial incentives for the collection, sale or deletion of California residents’ personal information, provided the incentive is not unjust, unreasonable, coercive or usurious, and is made available in compliance with applicable transparency, informed consent, and opt-out requirements. California residents have the right to be notified of any financial incentive offers and their material terms, the right to opt-out of such incentives at any time, and may not be included in such incentives without their prior informed opt-in consent. We do not offer any incentives at this time.

California Civil Code Section § 1798.83 permits users of our System that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
