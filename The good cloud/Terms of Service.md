takes precedence. © 2020 NLdigital



Section 1. General provisions



Article 1 Applicability NLdigital Terms



1.1 These NLdigital Terms (hereinafter also to be referred to as:

these general terms) apply to all offers and agreements for

which supplier delivers goods and/or services, of whatever

nature and under whatever name, to client.

1.2 These general terms can only be departed from or be

supplemented if agreed by parties in writing.

1.3 The applicability of any of the client’s purchase or other terms is

explicitly excluded.

1.4 If and insofar as supplier makes products or services of third

parties available to client or grants access to these products or

services, the terms of the third parties in question apply to

these products or services in the relationship between supplier

and client and replace the provisions in these general terms

that depart from those third party terms, provided that client has

been informed by supplier about the applicability of the

(licensing or sales) terms of those third parties and client has

been given a reasonable opportunity to take note of those

terms. Contrary to the previous sentence, client cannot invoke a

failure on the part of supplier to meet the aforementioned

obligation if client is a party as referred to in article 6:235

paragraph 1 or paragraph 3 of the Netherlands Civil Code.

1.5 If and insofar as the terms of third parties in the relationship

between client and supplier referred to above prove to be

inapplicable or are declared inapplicable for any reason

whatsoever, these general terms apply in full.

1.6 If any provision of these general terms should be null and void

or is annulled, the other provisions of these general terms

remain fully applicable and effective. In that case, supplier and

client consult as to arrange for new provisions which have the

same purport, as much as possible, and that will replace the

provisions that are null and void or that have been annulled.

1.7 Without prejudice to the provisions of article 1.4, the provisions

of these general terms prevail if a conflict should arise about

any of the arrangements made by parties, unless parties have

explicitly departed from these terms in writing, with reference to

these terms. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of

different sections of these general terms, the provisions of a

prior section apply, unless parties have explicitly agreed

otherwise.



Article 2 Offers



2.1 All off supplier’s offers and other forms of communication are

without obligation, unless supplier should indicate otherwise in

writing. Client guarantees the correctness and completeness of

the information provided, with the exception of obvious typing



errors, by or on behalf of client to supplier and on which

information supplier has based its offer.



Article 3 Price and payment



3.1 All prices are exclusive of turnover tax (VAT) and other product

or service-specific levies imposed by the authorities. All prices

quoted by supplier are in euros and client must pay in euros.

3.2 Client cannot derive any rights or expectations from any cost

estimate or budget issued by supplier, unless parties have

agreed otherwise in writing. A budget communicated by client is

only considered a (fixed) price agreed on by parties if this has

been explicitly agreed in writing.

3.3 If it should be apparent from the agreement that client consists

of several natural persons and/or legal persons, each of these

persons is jointly and severally liable to supplier for the

performance of the agreement.

3.4 Where the activities performed by supplier and the sums due by

client for these activities are concerned, the information in

supplier's administration provides full evidence, without

prejudice to client's right to provide evidence to the contrary.

3.5 In the event client should be under a periodic payment

obligation, supplier may adjust the applicable prices and rates,

in writing and in accordance with the index or any other criterion

included in the agreement, within the period specified in the

agreement. If the agreement does not explicitly provide for the

possibility to adjust the prices or rates, supplier may adjust the

applicable prices and rates in writing with due observance of a

period of at least three months. If, in the latter case, client does

not want to accept the price adjustment, client is entitled to

terminate the agreement by serving notice of termination

(opzeggen) in writing, within thirty days following the notification

of the adjustment and effective from the date on which the new

prices and/or rates would take effect.

3.6 In their agreement parties lay down the date or dates on which

supplier invoices the fee for the activities agreed on with client.

Any sums due are paid by client in accordance with the

payment terms agreed on or as stated in the invoice. Client is

neither entitled to suspend any payments nor to set off any of

the sums due.

3.7 If client should fail to pay the sums due or does not pay these

on time, the statutory interest for commercial agreements is

payable by client on any outstanding sum, without a reminder

or notice of default being required. If client should fail to pay the

sum due even after a reminder or notice of default, supplier can

pass on the claim for collection and client is obliged to pay,

within reason and in addition to the total sum due at that time,

2/18



all judicial and extrajudicial costs, including all costs charged by

external experts – all of which is without prejudice to any of

supplier’s statutory and contractual rights.



Article 4 Duration of the agreement



4.1 If and insofar as the agreement between parties is a continuing

performance contract, the agreement is entered into for the

term agreed on by parties. A term of one year applies if a

specific term has not been agreed on.

4.2 The duration of the agreement for a definite period of time is

tacitly extended, each time by the period of time originally

agreed on with a maximum of one year, unless client or

supplier should terminate the agreement by serving written

notice of termination (opzeggen), with due observance of a

notice period of three months prior to the end of the relevant

term.



Article 5 Confidentiality



5.1 Client and supplier ensure that secrecy is observed with

respect to all information received from the other party of which

information the receiving party knows or should reasonably

know it is confidential. This prohibition does not apply if and

insofar as the information concerned must be provided to a

third party in compliance with a judicial decision, a statutory

requirement, a statutory order by a public authority or for the

proper performance of the agreement. The party that receives

the confidential information may only use it for the purpose for

which it has been provided. Information is in any case deemed

confidential if it has been designated as such by either party.

5.2 Client acknowledges that software made available by supplier

is always confidential in nature and that this software contains

trade secrets of supplier and its suppliers or of the producer of

the software.



Article 6 Privacy and data processing



6.1 If this should be relevant, in supplier’s opinion, for the

performance of the agreement, client informs suppliers in

writing, at supplier’s request, about the way in which client

performs its obligations under the applicable rules and

regulations pertaining to the protection of personal data.

6.2 Client indemnifies supplier against any claims by persons

whose personal data are or have been processed and for which

processing client is responsible pursuant to the law, unless

client proves that the facts on which a claim is based are

attributable to supplier.

6.3 Client is fully responsible for the data that it processes when

making use of a service provided by supplier. Client guarantees

vis-à-vis supplier that the content, use and/or processing of the

data are not unlawful and do not infringe any third party’s right.

Client indemnifies supplier against any claims by a third party

instituted, for whatever reason, in connection with these data or

the performance of the agreement.

6.4 If, further to a request or a lawfully issued order by a public

authority or in the context of a statutory obligation, client should

perform activities with relation to data of client, client’s

employees or users, any costs involved in this may be charged

to client.

6.5 If supplier performs activities for client as a processor as meant

in the rules and regulations pertaining to the protection of

personal data, Section 2 ‘Standard Clauses for Processing’ also

applies.



Article 7 Security



7.1 If supplier is obliged to provide some form of information

security under the agreement, this protection meets the

specifications on security that parties have agreed on in writing.

Supplier does not guarantee that the information security

provided is effective under all circumstances. If the agreement

does not include an explicitly defined security method, the

security features provided meet a level that is not unreasonable

in view of the state of the art, the implementation costs, the

nature, scope and context as known to supplier of the

information to be secured, the purposes and the standard use

of supplier’s products and services and the probability and

seriousness of foreseeable risks.

7.2 The access or identification codes and certificates provided by

or on behalf of supplier to client are confidential and must be

treated as such by client, and they may only be made known to

authorised staff in client’s own organisation or company.

Supplier is entitled to change the access or identification codes

and certificates. Client is responsible for managing these

authorisations and for providing and duly revoking access and

identification codes.

7.3 In the event security features or the testing of security features

pertain to software, hardware or infrastructure that has not been

delivered by supplier to client, client guarantees that all licences

or approvals have been obtained so that the performance of

such activities is actually allowed. Supplier is not liable for any

damage caused by or in relation to the performance of these

activities. Client indemnifies supplier against any claims, for

whatever reason, arising from these activities being performed.

7.4 Supplier is entitled to adapt the security measures from time to

time if this should be required as a result of a change in

circumstances.

7.5 Client adequately secures its systems and infrastructure and

keeps these adequately secured.

7.6 Supplier may give client instructions about security features

intended to prevent or to minimalize incidents, or the

consequences of incidents, that may affect security. If client

should fail or follow the instructions issued by supplier or by a

relevant public authority, or should fail to follow these in time,

supplier is not liable and client indemnifies supplier against any

damage that may arise as a result.

7.7 Supplier is at any time permitted to install technical and

organizational facilities to protect hardware, data files websites,

software made available, software or other works to which

client has been granted access, whether directly or indirectly,

also in connection with a restriction agreed on in the content or

the duration of the right to use these objects. Client may not

remove or circumvent any of such technical facilities or have

these removed or circumvented.



Article 8 Retention of title, reservation of rights

and suspension



8.1 All goods delivered to client remain the property of supplier until

all sums due by client to supplier under the agreement entered

into by parties have been paid to supplier in full. A client that

acts as a reseller may sell and supply all goods that are subject

to the supplier’s retention of title insofar as this is customary in

the context of client’s normal course of business.

8.2 The property-law consequences of the retention of title with

respect to any goods destined for export is governed by the

laws of the state of destination if the relevant laws contain

provisions that are more favourable to supplier.

3/18



8.3 Where applicable, rights are granted or transferred to client

subject to the condition that client has paid all sums due under

the agreement.

8.4 Supplier may retain all information, documents, software and/or

data files received or created in the context of the agreement,

despite an existing obligation to hand these over or transfer

them, until client has paid all sums due to supplier.



Article 9 Transfer of risk



9.1 The risk of loss, theft, misappropriation or damage of goods,

information (including user names, codes and passwords),

documents, software or data files that are created for, delivered

to or used by client in the context of the performance of the

agreement pass to client at the moment these are placed under

the actual control of client or an auxiliary person of client.



Article 10 Intellectual property



10.1 All intellectual property rights to the software, websites, data

files, databases, hardware, training, testing and examination

materials, as well as other materials such as analyses, designs,

documentation, reports, offers, including preparatory materials

for these materials, developed or made available to client under

the agreement remain exclusively vested in supplier, its

licensors or its suppliers. Client is solely granted the rights of

use laid down in these general terms, in the agreement entered

into by parties in writing and in the applicable mandatory legal

provisions. A right of use granted to client is non-exclusive,

non-transferable, non-pledgeable (niet-verpandbaar) and non-

sublicensable.

10.2 If supplier is prepared to undertake to transfer an intellectual

property right, such undertaking may only be explicitly effected

in writing. If parties agree in writing that an intellectual property

right with respect to software, websites, data files, hardware,

know-how, or other works or materials specifically developed

for client is transferred to client, this does not affect supplier’s

rights or options to use and/or exploit, either for itself or for third

parties and without any restriction, the parts, designs,

algorithms, documentation, works, protocols, standards and the

like on which the developments referred to are based for other

purposes. Supplier is also entitled to use and/or exploit, either

for itself or for third parties and without any restrictions, the

general principles, ideas and programming languages that have

been used as a basis to create or develop any work for other

purposes. The transfer of an intellectual property right does not

affect supplier’s right to continue developing , either for itself or

for third parties, software - or elements of software - that are

similar to or derived from software – or elements of software -

that have been or are being developed for client.

10.3 Client is not permitted to remove or change any indication with

respect to the confidential nature of the software, websites,

data files, hardware or materials or with respect to copyrights,

brands, trade names or any other intellectual property right

pertaining to the software, websites, data files, hardware or

materials, or have any such indication removed or changed.

10.4 Supplier indemnifies client against any claim of a third party

based on the allegation that software, websites, data files,

hardware or other materials developed by supplier itself infringe

an intellectual property right of that third party, provided always

that client promptly informs supplier in writing about the

existence and content of the claim and leaves the settlement of

the claim, including any arrangements to be made in this

context, entirely up to supplier. To this end, client provides

supplier with the powers of attorney and information required

and renders the assistance supplier requires to defend itself



against such claims. This obligation to indemnity does not apply

if the alleged infringement concerns (i) works or materials made

available by client to supplier for use, modification, processing

or maintenance or (ii) modifications client has implemented or

modifications client has had implemented in the software,

websites, data files, hardware or other works and materials

without supplier’s written permission. If it is irrevocably

established in court that software, websites, data files,

hardware or other works and materials developed by supplier

itself should infringe any intellectual property right belonging to

a third party, or if, in supplier’s opinion, there is a good chance

that such an infringement will occur, supplier ensures, if

possible, that client can continue to use, or use functional

equivalents of, the software, websites, data files, hardware or

other works and materials delivered. Any other or further

obligation that supplier might have to indemnify client against

any infringement of a third party’s intellectual property right is

excluded.

10.5 Client guarantees that no rights of third parties preclude making

hardware, software, material intended for websites, data files

and/or other materials, designs and/or other works available to

supplier for the purpose of use, maintenance, processing,

installation or integration; this guarantee also pertains to client’s

having the relevant licences. Client indemnifies supplier against

any claim of a third party based on the allegation that making

any of this available and/or the use, maintenance, processing,

installation or integration infringes a right of that third party.

10.6 Supplier is never obliged to perform data conversion unless this

has been explicitly agreed on with client in writing.

10.7 Supplier is entitled to use client’s figurative mark, logo or name

in its external communication.



Article 11 Performance of services



11.1 Supplier performs its services with care to the best of its ability,

where applicable in accordance with the arrangements and

procedures agreed on with client in writing. All services

provided by supplier are performed on the basis of a best-

efforts obligation unless and insofar as supplier has explicitly

promised a result in the written agreement and the result

concerned has been described in the agreement in a

sufficiently precise manner.

11.2 Supplier is not liable for any damage suffered or costs incurred

as a result of the use or misuse that is made of access or

identification codes or certificates or any other security means

unless the misuse is the direct result of any intent or deliberate

recklessness on the part of supplier’s management.

11.3 If the agreement has been entered into with a view to it being

performed by one specific person, supplier is always entitled to

replace this person by one or more persons who have the same

and/or similar qualifications.

11.4 Supplier is not obliged to follow client’s instructions when

performing the services, more particularly not if these

instructions change or add to the content or scope of the

services agreed on. If such instructions are followed, however,

the activities performed are charged at supplier’s applicable

rates.



Article 12 Obligation to provide information and

render assistance



12.1 Parties acknowledge that the success of activities to be

performed in the field of information and communications

technology depends on proper and timely cooperation of

parties. Client undertakes always to fully cooperate, within

reason, and in time.

4/18



12.2 Client vouches for the correctness and completeness of the

data, information, designs and specifications provided by on or

behalf of client to supplier. If the data, information, designs or

specifications provided by client should contain inaccuracies

apparent to supplier, supplier requests client to provide further

information.

12.3 For reasons of continuity, client designates a contact person or

contact persons who act in that capacity for the time supplier

performs it services. Client’s contact persons have the relevant

experience required, specific knowledge of the subject matter

and a proper understanding of the objectives that client wishes

to achieve.

12.4 Client bears the risk of selecting the goods and/or services to

be provided by supplier. Client always exercises the utmost

care to guarantee that the requirements set for supplier’s

performance are correct and complete. Measurements and

data provided in drawings, images, catalogues, websites,

offers, advertising material, standardisation sheets and the like

are not binding on supplier unless explicitly stated otherwise by

supplier.

12.5 If client deploys employees and/or auxiliary persons in the

performance of the agreement, these employees and auxiliary

persons must have the knowledge and experience required. If

supplier’s employees perform activities at client’s premises,

client ensures the facilities required are available, such as a

workspace with computer and network facilities, on time and

free of charge. Supplier is not liable for damage suffered or

costs incurred by transmission errors, malfunctions or the non-

availability of these facilities unless client proves that this

damage or these costs are caused by intent or deliberate

recklessness on the part of supplier’s management .

12.6 The workspace and facilities must meet all statutory

requirements. Client indemnifies supplier against claims of third

parties, including supplier's employees, who, when performing

the agreement, suffer damage caused by client’s acts or

omissions or by unsafe situations in client’s organisation or

company. Before the activities to be performed start, client

informs the employees deployed by supplier about the

company rules, information rules and security rules that apply in

client’s organisation or company.

12.7 Client is responsible for the management, including checks of

the settings, and use of the products delivered and/or services

provided by supplier, and the way in which the results of the

products and services are implemented. Client is also

responsible for appropriately instructing users and for the use of

the products and services that is made by users.

12.8 Client itself is responsible for the hardware, infrastructure and

auxiliary software and ensures that the (auxiliary) software for

its own hardware is installed, organised, parameterised and

tuned and, where required, that the hardware, other (auxiliary)

software and the operating environment used are modified and

kept updated, and that the interoperability wanted by client is

effected.



Article 13 Project and steering groups



13.1 If both parties are participating in a project or steering group in

which one or more of their employees have been appointed, the

provision of information takes place in the manner agreed on

for that project or steering group.

13.2 Decisions made in a project or steering group in which both

parties are participating are only binding on supplier if the

decisions are made in accordance with that which parties have

agreed on in writing in this regard or, if no written arrangements

have been made in this context, if supplier has accepted the

relevant decision in writing. Supplier is never obliged to accept



or implement a decision if, in its opinion, the decision cannot be

reconciled with the content and/or proper performance of the

agreement.

13.3 Client ensures that the persons that it has assigned to

participate in a project or steering group are authorised to make

decisions that are binding on client.



Article 14 Terms and deadlines



14.1 Supplier makes reasonable efforts, within reason, to comply to

the greatest extent possible with the terms and delivery periods

and/or dates and delivery dates, whether or not these are

deadlines and/or strict dates, that it has specified or that have

been agreed on by parties. The interim dates and delivery

dates specified by supplier or agreed on by parties always

apply as target dates, do not bind supplier and are always

indicative.

14.2 If a term or period of time is likely to be exceeded, supplier and

client consult as to to discuss the consequences of the term

being exceeded in relation to further planning.

14.3 In all cases – therefore, also if parties have agreed on

deadlines and strict delivery periods or dates and delivery dates

– supplier is only in default because of a term or period of time

being exceeded after client has served supplier with a written

notice of default and has set a reasonable period of time for

supplier to remedy the failure to meet its obligations and this

reasonable term has passed. The notice of default must

describe supplier’s breach to meet its obligations as

comprehensively and in as much detail as possible so that

supplier has the opportunity to respond adequately.

14.4 If it has been agreed that the activities to be performed under

the agreement must be performed in phases, supplier is entitled

to postpone the start of the activities for a next phase until client

has approved the results of the preceding phase in writing.

14.5 Supplier is not bound by a date or delivery date or term or

delivery period, whether or not these are deadlines and/or strict

dates, if parties have agreed on an adjustment in the content or

scope of the agreement (additional work, a change of

specifications, etc.) or a change in approach with respect to the

performance of the agreement, or if client fails to fulfil its

obligations under the agreement or fails to do so on time or in

full. If additional work should be required during the

performance of the agreement, this never constitutes a reason

for client to give notice of termination of the agreement

(opzeggen) or to terminate the agreement for breach

(ontbinden).



Article 15 Termination of the agreement for

breach or by serving notice of

termination



15.1 Either party is exclusively entitled to terminate the agreement

for breach (ontbinden) following an imputable failure of the

other party to meet it is obligations under the agreement if the

other party, in all cases after a written notice of default has

been served that is as detailed as possible and in which the

other party is granted a reasonable period of time to remedy the

breach, should still imputably fail to meet any of its essential

obligations under the agreement. Client’s payment obligations

and all obligations of client or a third party contracted by client

to cooperate and/or to provide information apply in all cases as

essential obligations under the agreement.

15.2 If, at the time of the termination for breach, client has already

received goods or services in the performance of the

agreement, this performance and the relevant payment

obligations cannot be undone unless client proves that supplier

5/18



is in default with respect to the essential part of the

performance due. With due regard to the provisions of the

preceding sentence, sums invoiced by supplier prior to the

termination for breach in connection with what has already

been properly performed or delivered in the performance of the

agreement remain due in full and become immediately payable

at the time of the termination for breach.

15.3 An agreement which, due to its nature and content, is not

discharged by performance and which has been entered into

for an indefinite period of time may be terminated, following

consultation between parties, by either party by serving written

notice of termination to the other party (opzeggen). Reasons for

the termination must be stated. If a notice period has not been

agreed on between parties, a reasonable period must be

observed when notice of termination is served. Supplier is

never obliged to pay any compensation because of this

termination.

15.4 Client is not entitled to terminate (opzeggen) an agreement for

services that has been entered into for a definite period of time

before the end of the term; client is not entitled either to

terminate (opzeggen) an agreement that ends by completion

before it has been completed.

15.5 Either party may terminate (opzeggen) the agreement in

writing, in whole or in part, without notice of default being

required and with immediate effect, if the other party is granted

a suspension of payments, whether or not provisional, a petition

for bankruptcy is filed against the other party or the company of

the other party is liquidated or dissolved other than for

restructuring purposes or for a merger of companies. Supplier

may also terminate (opzeggen) the agreement, in whole or in

part, without notice of default being required and with

immediate effect, if a direct or indirect change occurs in the

decisive control of client’s company. Supplier is never obliged

to repay any sum of money already received or pay any sum of

money in compensation because of termination as referred to in

this paragraph. If client is irrevocably bankrupted, its right to

use the software, websites and the like made available to client

ends, as does its right to access and/or use supplier’s services,

without supplier being required to cancel these rights.



Article 16 Supplier’s liability



16.1 Supplier’s total liability for an imputable failure in the

performance of the agreement or arising from any other legal

basis whatsoever, explicitly including each and every failure to

meet a guarantee or indemnification obligation agreed on with

client, is limited to the compensation of damages as described

in more detail in this article.

16.2 Direct damage is limited to a maximum of the price stipulated

for the agreement in question (excluding VAT). If the agreement

is mainly a continuing performance contract with a duration of

more than one year, the price stipulated for the agreement is

set at the total sum of the payments (excluding VAT) stipulated

for one year. In no event does supplier’s total liability for any

direct damage, on any legal basis whatsoever, exceed EUR

500,000 (five hundred thousand euros).

16.3 Supplier’s total liability for any damage arising from death or

bodily injury or arising from material damage to goods is limited

to the amount of EUR 1,250,000 (one million two hundred fifty

thousand euros).

16.4 Liability for indirect damage, consequential loss, loss of profits,

lost savings, reduced goodwill, loss due to business

interruption, loss as a result of claims of client’s clients, loss

arising from the use of goods, materials or software of third

parties prescribed by client to supplier and any damage and

loss arising from contracting suppliers client has recommended



to supplier is excluded. Liability for corruption, destruction or

loss of data or documents is also excluded.

16.5 The exclusions and limitations of supplier’s liability described

articles 16.2 up to and including 16.4 are without any prejudice

whatsoever to the other exclusions and limitations of supplier’s

liability described in these general terms.

16.6 The exclusions and limitations referred to in articles 16.2 up to

and including 16.5 cease to apply if and insofar as the damage

is caused by intent or deliberate recklessness on the part of

supplier’s management.

16.7 Unless performance by supplier is permanently impossible,

supplier is exclusively liable for an imputable failure in the

performance of an agreement if client promptly serves supplier

with a written notice of default, granting supplier a reasonable

period of time to remedy the breach, and supplier should still

imputably fail to meet its obligations after that reasonable term

has passed. The notice of default must describe supplier’s

failure as comprehensively and in as much detail as possible so

that supplier has the opportunity to respond adequately.

16.8 The right to compensation of damages exclusively arises if

client reports the damage to supplier in writing as soon as

possible after the damage has occurred. Any claim for

compensation of damages filed against supplier lapses by the

mere expiry of a period of twenty four months following the

inception of the claim unless client has instituted a legal action

for damages prior to the expiry of this term.

16.9 Client indemnifies supplier against any and all claims of third

parties arising from product liability because of a defect in a

product or system that client delivered to a third party and that

consisted in part of hardware, software or other materials

delivered by supplier, unless and insofar as client is able to

prove that the loss was caused by the hardware, software or

other materials referred to.

16.10 The provisions of this article and all other exclusions and

limitations of liability referred to in these general terms also

apply in favour of all natural persons and legal persons that

supplier and supplier’s suppliers contracts for the performance

of the agreement.



Article 17 Force Majeure



17.1 Neither party is obliged to meet any obligation, including any

statutory and/or agreed guarantee obligation, if it is prevented

from doing so by circumstances beyond its control (overmacht).

Circumstances beyond supplier’s control include, among other

things: (i) circumstances beyond the control of supplier’s

suppliers, (ii) the failure by supplier to properly meet obligations

that were contracted by supplier on client’s instructions, (iii)

defects in goods, hardware, software or materials of third

parties that supplier uses on client’s instructions, (iv) measures

by public authorities, (v) power failures, (vi) failures of the

Internet, data network or telecommunication facilities, (vii)

(cyber) crime, (cyber) vandalism, war or terrorism and (viii)

general transport problems.

17.2 If a force majeure situation lasts for more than sixty days, either

party has the right to terminate the agreement, in writing, for

breach (ontbinden). In such event, all that has already been

performed under the agreement must be paid for on a

proportional basis, without anything else being due by either

party to the other party.



Article 18 Service Level Agreement



18.1 Possible arrangements about a service level (Service Level

Agreement) are exclusively agreed on in writing. Client

6/18



promptly informs supplier about any circumstances that may

affect the service level or its availability.

18.2 If any arrangements have been made about a service level, the

availability of software, systems and related services is always

measured in such a way that unavailability due to preventive,

corrective or adaptive maintenance service or other forms of

service that supplier has notified client of in advance and

circumstances beyond supplier’s control are not taken into

account. Subject to proof to the contrary offered by client, the

availability measured by supplier is considered conclusive.



Article 19 Backups



19.1 If the services provided to client under the agreement include

making backups of client’s data, supplier makes a complete

backup of client’s data in its possession, with due observance

of the periods of time agreed on in writing, or once a week if

such terms have not been agreed on. Supplier keeps the

backup for the duration of the agreed term or for the duration of

supplier’s usual term if no further arrangements have been

made in this regard. Supplier keeps the backup with due care

and diligence.

19.2 Client itself remains responsible for complying with all the

applicable statutory obligations with respect to keeping records

and data retention.



Article 20 Adjustments and extra work



20.1 If, at client’s request or after client’s prior consent, supplier has

performed activities or has delivered goods or services that are

outside the scope of the agreed activities and/or delivery of

goods or services, client is charged for these activities or for

these goods or services on the basis of the agreed rates or, if

no rates have been agreed on by parties, on the basis of

supplier’s applicable rates. Supplier is not obliged to honour

such request and may require that, to that purpose, a separate

agreement should be entered into in writing.

20.2 Client realises that adjustments and extra work (may) result in

terms and delivery periods and/or dates and delivery dates

being postponed. Any new terms and delivery periods and/or

dates and delivery dates indicated by supplier replace the

previous terms and delivery periods and/or dates and delivery

dates.

20.3 Insofar as a fixed price has been agreed on for the agreement,

supplier informs client, at client’s request and in writing, about

the financial consequences of the extra work or additional

delivery of goods or services referred to in this article.



Article 21 Transfer of rights and obligations



21.1 Client is not entitled to sell, transfer or pledge (verpanden) its

rights and obligations under an agreement to a third party.

21.2 Supplier is entitled to sell, transfer or pledge (verpanden) any

claims it has to payment of any sums due to a third party.



Article 22 Applicable law and disputes



22.1 The agreements between supplier and client are governed by

the laws of the Netherlands. Applicability of the Vienna

Convention 1980 (The United Nations Convention on Contracts

for the International Sale of Goods (CISG)) is excluded.

22.2 Any disputes that may arise from an agreement between

parties and/or from any further agreements deriving from this

agreement are resolved by arbitration in accordance with the

Arbitration Regulations of the Foundation for the Settlement of

Automation Disputes (Stichting Geschillenoplossing



Automatisering – SGOA – (www.sgoa.eu), this without

prejudice to either party’s right to request preliminary relief in

preliminary relief proceedings or arbitral preliminary relief

proceedings and without prejudice to either party’s right to

attach property before judgment. Arbitration proceedings take

place in Amsterdam, or in any other place designated in the

Arbitration Regulations.

22.3 If a dispute that arises from an agreement entered into by

parties or from any further agreements deriving from this

agreement is within the jurisdiction of the cantonal section of

the Netherlands District Court (kantongerecht), either party is

entitled, notwithstanding the provisions of article 22.2, to bring

the case as a cantonal court case before the competent district

court in the Netherlands. Parties are only entitled to initiate

these proceedings if arbitration proceedings concerning the

dispute have not yet been instituted under the provisions of

article 22.2. If, with due observance of the provisions of this

article 22.3, either party has brought the case before the

competent district court to be heard and decided, the cantonal

judge of that district court is competent to hear the case and to

decide on it.

22.4 Regarding a dispute that arises from an agreement entered into

by parties or from any further agreements deriving from this

agreement, either party is always entitled to institute ICT

mediation proceedings in accordance with the ICT Mediation

Regulations of the Foundation for the Settlement of Automation

Disputes (Stichting Geschillenoplossing Automatisering –

SGOA – (www.sgoa.eu). The other party is then obliged to

actively participate in the ICT mediation proceedings that have

been instituted. This legally enforceable obligation in any case

includes having to attend at least one joint meeting of mediators

and parties, in order to give this extrajudicial form of dispute

resolution a chance of success. Either party is free to terminate

the ICT mediation proceedings at any time after this first joint

meeting of mediators and parties. The provisions of this

paragraph do not prevent either party, if this party deems doing

so necessary, from requesting preliminary relief in preliminary

relief proceedings or in arbitral preliminary relief proceedings

nor do they prevent either party from attaching property before

judgment.



Section 2. Standard clauses on data

processing



The provisions in this section ‘Standard clauses on data

processing’ apply, apart from the General provisions of

these general terms, if supplier processes personal data, in

the context of the performance of an agreement, for the

controller(s) as (sub)processor as meant in the laws and

regulations on personal data protection. These ‘Standard

clauses on data processing’ together with the practical

arrangements made on personal data processing in the

agreement or in a separate appendix (for example a Data

Pro Statement) form a processing agreement as meant in

article 28, paragraph 3 of the General Data Protection

Regulation (GDPR).



Article 23 General



23.1 Supplier processes the personal data on client’s behalf and in

accordance with the written instructions agreed on by supplier

and client.

23.2 Client, or client’s client, is the controller in the sense of the

GDPR, has control over the processing of personal data and

7/18



has established the purpose of and the means for the personal

data processing.

23.3 Supplier is processor in the sense of the GDPR and, for that

reason, has no control over the purpose of and the means for

the personal data processing and, therefore, does not take any

decisions on, amongst other things, the use of the personal

data.

23.4 Supplier implements the GDPR as laid down in this section

‘Standard clauses on data processing’ and in the agreement.

Client is responsible for assessing, on the basis of this

information, whether supplier offers adequate guarantees with

respect to applying appropriate technical and organisational

measures for the processing to meet the requirements posed

by the GDPR and to adequately safeguard the protection of the

data subjects’ rights.

23.5 Client guarantees vis-à-vis supplier that it acts in compliance

with the GDPR, that its systems and infrastructure are at any

time appropriately secured and that the content, the use and/or

the processing of the personal data are not unlawful and do not

breach any third party rights.

23.6 Client is not entitled to seek recovery from supplier of an

administrative fine imposed on client by the supervisory

authority, on whatever legal ground. In the present section

(Section 2) ‘supervisory authority’ is understood to mean the

supervisory authority referred to in the GDPR.



Article 24 Security



24.1 Supplier takes all the technical and organisational security

measures described in the agreement. When implementing

these technical and organisational measures, supplier has

taken into account the state of the art, the costs involved in

implementing the security measures, the nature, scope and

context of the processing, the nature of its products and

services, the processing risks and the varying risks, in terms of

likelihood and severity, posed to the rights and freedoms of the

data subjects that supplier could expect in view of the use

iintended to be made of its products and services.

24.2 Unless explicitly stated otherwise in the agreement, supplier’s

product or service is not intended for processing special

categories of personal data or data relating to convictions under

criminal law or criminal offences.

24.3 Supplier endeavours to ensure that the security measures to be

taken by supplier are appropriate for the use of the product or

service intended by supplier.

24.4 The security measures described offer a security level, in

client’s opinion and taking the factors referred to in article 24.1

into account, appropriate to the risk involved in processing

personal data used or provided by client.

24.5 Supplier may adjust the security measures implemented if this

should be required, in supplier’s opinion, to continue to offer an

appropriate security level. Supplier keeps a record of important

adjustments and informs client of these adjustments where

relevant.

24.6 Client may request supplier to implement further security

measures. Supplier is not obliged to implement any

adjustments in its security measures following such request.

Supplier may charge client for the costs involved in

implementing the adjustments requested by client. Supplier is

not obliged to actually implement these adjusted security

measures before the security measures requested by client

have been agreed on in writing.



Article 25 Personal data breaches



25.1 Supplier does not guarantee that the security measures are

effective in all circumstances. If supplier discovers a personal

data breach, supplier informs client of this without undue delay.

The agreement stipulates in which way supplier informs client

of personal data breaches. If no specific arrangements have

been agreed on, supplier contacts the client’s contact person in

the usual way.

25.2 It is up to the controller – i.e. client or client’s client – to assess

whether the personal data breach reported by supplier must be

reported to the supervisory authority or the data subject.

Reporting personal data breaches is, at any time, controller’s –

i.e. client’s or client’s client’s – responsibility. Supplier is not

obliged to report personal data breaches to the supervisory

authority and/or the data subject.

25.3 Where required, supplier provides further information on the

personal data breach and renders assistance in providing the

information to client that client needs to report a breach to the

supervisory authority or the data subject.

25.4 Supplier may charge client for the costs involved in this context,

within reason and at supplier’s current rates.



Article 26 Confidentiality



26.1 Supplier ensures that the obligation to observe confidentiality is

imposed on any person processing personal data under

supplier’s responsibility.

26.2 Supplier is entitled to provide personal data to third parties if

and insofar as this should be required pursuant to a judicial

decision or a statutory requirement, on the basis of an

authorised order by a public authority or in the context of the

proper performance of the agreement.



Article 27 Obligations following termination



27.1 In the event the processing agreement ends, supplier deletes,

within the period of time agreed on in the agreement, all

personal data received from client that it has in its possession

in such a way that they can no longer be used and are

rendered inaccessible, or, if agreed on, returns these data to

client in a machine readable format.

27.2 Supplier may charge client for any costs possibly incurred in the

context of the stipulation in the previous paragraph. Further

arrangements on this may be laid down in the agreement.

27.3 The provisions of article 27.1 do not apply if statutory provisions

should prohibit supplier to delete the personal data or return

these, in part or in full. In such event supplier only continues to

process the personal data insofar as required under its

statutory obligations. The provisions of article 27.1 do not apply

either if supplier is a controller in the sense of the GDPR with

respect to the personal data.



Article 28 Data subjects’ rights, Data Protection

Impact Assessment (DPIA) and audit

rights



28.1 Where possible, supplier renders assistance in reasonable

requests by client that are related to data subjects exercising

their rights against client. If supplier is directly contacted by a

data subject, supplier refers this data subject, whenever

possible, to client.

28.2 If client should be obliged under the GDPR to carry out a Data

Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) or a prior consultation

following this, supplier renders assistance, at client’s

reasonable request, in this DPIA or prior consultation.

8/18



28.3 At client’s request, supplier provides all information that would

be reasonably required to demonstrate compliance with the

arrangements laid down in the agreement with respect to

personal data processing, for example by means of a valid Data

Pro Certificate or another certificate at least equal to it, an audit

report (Third Party Memorandum) drafted by an independent

expert commissioned by supplier or by means of other

information to be provided by supplier. If client should

nevertheless have reasons to assume that the personal data

are not processed in accordance with the agreement, client

may commission an audit, no more than once per year and at

client’s expense, by an independent, certified external expert

who has demonstrable experience in the type of data

processing that is carried out under the agreement. Supplier is

entitled to refuse an expert if this expert affects, in supplier’s

opinion, supplier’s competitive position. The audit is limited to

verifying compliance with the arrangements on personal data

processing as laid down in the agreement. The expert is

obliged to observe confidentiality with respect to his findings

and only reports issues to client which result in a failure by

supplier to meet its obligations under the agreement. The

expert provides supplier with a copy of his report. Supplier may

refuse an expert, an audit or an instruction by the expert if this

should be, in supplier’s opinion, in violation of the GDPR or

other laws and regulations or if this should be an unacceptable

breach of the security measures implemented by supplier.

28.4 Parties hold consultations on the findings of the report as soon

as possible. Parties comply with the improvement measures

proposed and laid down in the report insofar as this can be

reasonably expected from them. Supplier implements the

proposed measures insofar as these are appropriate in

supplier’s opinion, taking into account the processing risks

associated with supplier’s product or service, the state of the

art, the implementation costs, the market in which supplier

operates and the intended use of the product or service.

28.5 Supplier is entitled to charge client for the costs it has incurred

in the context of the provisions laid down in this article.



Article 29 Subprocessors



29.1 Supplier has stated in the agreement if and, if so, which third

parties (subprocessors) supplier contracts for the processing of

personal data.

29.2 Client grants supplier permission to contract other

subprocessors in the performance of supplier’s obligations

under the agreement.

29.3 Supplier informs client about possible changes with respect to

the third parties it contracts. Client is entitled to object to said

change by supplier.



Section 3\. Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)



The provisions in this section ‘Software-as-a-service

(SaaS)’ apply, apart from the General provisions of these

general terms, if supplier performs services under the

name or in the field of Software-as-a-Service (also referred

to as: SaaS). For the application of these general terms,

SaaS is understood to mean a service by which supplier

makes functionality available to and keeps functionality

available for client remotely, through the Internet or

another data network, without providing client with a

physical carrier with or download of the relevant

underlying software.



Article 30 SaaS Implementation



30.1 Supplier provides the SaaS on client’s instructions. Client may

solely use the SaaS for its own organisation or company and

only insofar as required for the use intended by supplier. Client

may not allow third parties to make use of the SaaS.

30.2 Supplier may adjust the content or scope of the SaaS. If such

adjustments are substantive and result in a change in client’s

current procedures, supplier informs client about this as soon

as possible and the costs of this adjustment are at client’s

expense. In this case client may serve notice of termination of

the agreement (opzeggen), which termination takes effect on

the date on which the adjustment takes effect, unless the

adjustment is related to amendments in relevant legislation or

other instructions issued by public authorities, or the adjustment

is at supplier’s expense.

30.3 Supplier may continue to provide the SaaS using a new or

modified version of the underlying software. Supplier is not

obliged to maintain, modify or add particular features or

functionalities of the SaaS specifically for client.

30.4 Supplier may temporarily put all or part of the SaaS out of

service for preventive, corrective or adaptive maintenance

services or other forms of service. Supplier ensures that the

period of time during which the SaaS is out of operation does

not take longer than necessary and ensures, where possible,

that the service takes place at times when the SaaS is usually

used least intensively.

30.5 Supplier is never obliged to provide client with a physical carrier

or download of the underlying software.

30.6 If no further arrangements have been made in this regard, client

itself is responsible for designing, configuring, parameterising

and tuning the SaaS, converting and uploading possible data

and, where required, for modifying the hardware and user

environment used.



Article 31 Guarantees



31.1 Supplier does not guarantee that the SaaS is free of errors and

functions without any interruptions. Supplier makes every effort

to repair the errors in the underlying software referred to in

article 36.3 within a reasonable period of time if and insofar as

underlying software is concerned that has been developed by

supplier itself and client has provided supplier with a detailed,

written description of the relevant errors. In a particular case,

supplier may postpone repairing errors until a new version of

the underlying software is put into service. Supplier does not

guarantee that errors in the SaaS that has not been developed

by supplier itself are repaired. Supplier is entitled to install

temporary solutions, program bypasses or problem-avoiding

restrictions in the SaaS. If the SaaS, or part of it, has been

developed on client’s instructions, supplier may charge client

for the costs incurred by repairing the error(s) at supplier’s

applicable rates. Supplier is never obliged to repair other

imperfections than those referred to in this article. In the event

supplier is prepared to remedy other imperfections than those

referred to in this article, supplier is entitled to charge client a

separate fee for this.

31.2 On the basis of the information provided by supplier on

measures to prevent and restrict the effects of malfunctions,

errors and other imperfections in the SaaS, corruption or loss of

data or other incidents, client identifies and lists the risks to its

organisation or company and, where necessary, takes

additional measures. Supplier declares itself prepared to render

assistance, at client’s request, to the extent reasonable and

according to the financial and other conditions set by supplier,

with respect to further measures to be taken by client. Supplier

9/18



is never obliged to recover data that have been corrupted or

lost other than placing back – where possible – the most recent

back-up of the data in question.

31.3 Supplier does not guarantee that the SaaS is timely adapted to

any amendments in the relevant laws and regulations.



Article 32 Commencement of the service;

payment



32.1 The SaaS provided by supplier – and, where relevant, support

– commences within a reasonable period of time after the

agreement has been entered into. Unless agreed on otherwise,

the SaaS commences by supplier client granting access to the

SaaS that is made available by supplier. Client ensures that it

has the facilities required to use the SaaS immediately after the

agreement has been entered into.

32.2 The fee payable by client for the SaaS is included in the

agreement. If no payment scheme has been agreed on, all

sums related to the SaaS delivered by supplier become due

and payable, in advance, per calendar month.



Article 33 Additional provisions



33.1 The following articles apply equally to the SaaS: 34.3, 34.5,

34.8, 36.1 (excluding the reference to art. 40), 36.11, 48.4,

49.1, 49.2, 62.2 and 62.4 and 63. In these articles the word

‘software’ should be read as ‘SaaS’ and the word ‘delivery’ as

‘commencement of the service’.



Section 4. Software



The provisions in this section ‘Software’ apply, apart from

the General provisions of these general terms, if supplier

makes software and apps available to client for use,

together with the relevant data or databases and/or user

documentation for this software– in these general terms

together to be referred to as ‘software’ – other than on the

basis of a SaaS.



Article 34 Right to use and restrictions on use



34.1 Supplier makes the software agreed on available for use by

client on the basis of a user licence and for the term of the

agreement. The right to use the software is non-exclusive, non-

transferable, non-pledgeable and non-sublicensable.

34.2 Supplier’s obligation to make the software available and client’s

right to use the software exclusively extend to the so-called

object code of the software. Client’s right to use the software

does not pertain to the software’s source code. The source

code of the software and the technical documentation drafted

when the software was developed are not made available to

client, not even if client is prepared to pay a financial

compensation.

34.3 Client always strictly complies with the agreed restrictions on

the use of the software, regardless of the nature or the content

of these restrictions.

34.4 If parties have agreed that the software may only be used in

combination with particular hardware and this hardware has a

malfunction, client is entitled to use the software on other

hardware with the same qualifications during the period of time

that the original hardware remains defective.

34.5 Supplier may require that client should only start using the

software after it has received one or more codes needed for the

use from supplier, from supplier’s supplier or from the producer

of the software.



34.6 Client is only entitled to use the software in and for its own

organisation or company and only insofar as required for the

intended use. Client does not use the software for the benefit of

third parties, for example in the context of Software-as-a-

Service (SaaS) or outsourcing.

34.7 Client is never entitled to sell, lease or alienate, or grant limited

rights to, or make the software and the carriers on which the

software is or will be recorded available to third parties, in any

way whatsoever, for whatever purpose or under whatever title.

Neither is client entitled to grant, whether or not remotely

(online), a third party access to the software or place the

software with a third party for hosting, not even if the third party

concerned exclusively uses the software in client’s interest.

34.8 If so requested, client promptly renders assistance in any

investigation into compliance with the agreed restrictions on

use to be carried out by or on behalf of supplier. At supplier’s

first request, client grants supplier access to its buildings and

systems. Insofar as such information does not concern the use

of the software itself, supplier observes secrecy with respect to

all confidential business information that it obtains from client or

at client’s business location in the context of an investigation.

34.9 Parties agree that the agreement entered into by parties is

never seen as a purchase agreement where it is related to

making software available for use.

34.10 Supplier is not obliged to maintain the software and/or provide

support to users and/or administrators of the software. If,

contrary to the foregoing, supplier is asked to perform

maintenance activities and/or provide support for the software,

supplier may require that client should enter into a separate,

written agreement for this purpose.



Article 35 Delivery and installation



35.1 At its discretion, supplier either delivers the software on the

agreed type of data carrier or, if no arrangements have been

made in this regard, on a type of data carrier determined by

supplier, or makes the software online available to client. At

supplier’s discretion, any agreed user documentation is made

available in hardcopy or digital form, in a language determined

by supplier.

35.2 Supplier only installs the software at client’s business premises

if this has been agreed on. If no arrangements have been made

in this respect, client itself is responsible for installing,

designing, parameterising, tuning and, if necessary, for

modifying the hardware and operating environment used.



Article 36 Acceptance



36.1 If parties have not agreed on an acceptance test, client accepts

the software in the state that it is in when delivered (‘as is,

where is’), therefore, with all visible and invisible errors and

defects, without prejudice to supplier’s obligations under the

guarantee scheme as set out in article 40. If this should be the

case, the software is deemed to have been accepted by client

upon delivery or, if installation by supplier has been agreed on

in writing, upon completion of the installation.

36.2 If an acceptance test has been agreed on by parties, the

provisions of articles 36.3 up to and including 36.10 apply.

36.3 Where these general terms refer to ‘error’ this is understood to

mean a substantial failure of the software to meet the functional

or technical specifications of the software explicitly made known

by supplier in writing and, if all or part of the software is

customised software, a substantial failure to meet the functional

or technical specifications explicitly agreed on in writing. An

error only exists if it can be demonstrated by client and if it is

reproducible. Client is obliged to report errors without delay.

10/18



Supplier does not have any other obligation whatsoever with

respect to other imperfections in or on the software than those

in relation to errors in the sense of these general terms.

36.4 If an acceptance test has been agreed on, the test period is

fourteen days following delivery or, if installation by supplier has

been agreed on in writing, fourteen days following the

completion of installation. During the test period, client may not

use the software for production or operational purposes. Client

performs the agreed acceptance test with qualified personnel,

to an adequate extent and in sufficient detail.

36.5 If an acceptance test has been agreed on, client is obliged to

check whether the software delivered meets the functional or

technical specifications explicitly made known by supplier in

writing and, if and to the extent that all or part of the software is

customised software, that it meets the functional or technical

specifications explicitly agreed on in writing.

36.6 If testing on client’s instruction involves personal data being

made use of, client ensures that using these data for this

purpose is permitted.

36.7 The software is understood to have been accepted:

a if parties have agreed on an acceptance test: on the first

day following the test period, or

b if supplier receives a test report as referred to in article 36.8

prior to the end of the test period: at the time the errors

listed in this test report have been repaired, notwithstanding

the presence of errors that, according to article 36.9, do not

prevent acceptance, or

c if client uses the software in any way for production or

operational purposes: at the time it is put into use for

production or operational purposes.

36.8 If it should become clear when the agreed acceptance test is

carried out that the software contains errors, client reports the

test results to supplier in writing in a well-ordered, detailed and

understandable manner no later than on the last day of the test

period. Supplier makes every effort to repair the errors referred

to within a reasonable period of time. In this context, supplier is

entitled to install temporary solutions, program bypasses or

problem-avoiding restrictions.

36.9 Client is neither entitled to refuse to accept the software for

reasons that are not related to the specifications explicitly

agreed on in writing by parties nor entitled to refuse to accept

the software because it has minor errors, i.e. errors that do not

prevent – within reason – the productive or operational use of

the software, all of this without prejudice to supplier’s obligation

to repair these minor errors as referred to in article 40.

Acceptance may not be refused either because of aspects of

the software that can only be assessed subjectively, such as

aesthetic aspects of the user interfaces.

36.10 If the software is delivered and tested in phases and/or parts,

non-acceptance of a certain phase and/or part is without

prejudice to the acceptance of a previous phase and/or a

different part.

36.11 Acceptance of the software in one of the ways referred to in this

article results in supplier being discharged of its obligations in

the context of making the software available and delivering it

and, if installation of the software by supplier has also been

agreed on, of its obligations in the context of installing it.

36.12 Acceptance of the software is without prejudice to client’s rights

under article 36.9 regarding minor errors and article 40

providing for guarantees.



Article 37 Making the software available



37.1 Supplier makes the software available to client within a

reasonable period of time after parties have entered into the

agreement.



37.2 Immediately after the agreement ends, client returns all copies

of the software in its possession to supplier. If it has been

agreed that client is obliged to destroy the relevant copies when

the agreement ends, client informs supplier, promptly and in

writing, that the copies have been destroyed. When the

agreement ends or after it has ended, supplier is not obliged to

render assistance in any data conversion that client may

possibly want to carry out.



Article 38 Payment for the right to use

the software



38.1 The sum due for the right to use is payable by client at the

agreed times or, if a time has not been agreed on:

a if parties have not agreed that supplier is responsible for

the installation of the software:

● upon delivery of the software; or

● in the event periodic payments are due for the right to

use, upon delivery of the software and subsequently

when each new term of the right to use commences;

b. if parties have agreed that supplier is responsible for the

installation of the software:

● upon completion of that installation;

● in the event periodic payments are due for the right to

use the software, upon completion of that installation

and subsequently when each new term of the right to

use commences.



Article 39 Modifications in the software



39.1 Except where mandatory statutory provisions should provide

otherwise, client is not entitled to modify all or part of the

software without supplier’s prior written permission. Supplier is

entitled to refuse permission or to attach conditions to its

permission. Client bears the entire risk of all modifications that it

implements – whether or not with supplier’s permission – or that

client has implemented by third parties on its instructions.



Article 40 Guarantees



40.1 Supplier makes reasonable efforts to repair errors in the sense

of article 36.3 within a reasonable period of time if these errors

are reported, in detail and in writing, to supplier within a period

of three months after delivery or, if an acceptance test was

agreed, within three months after acceptance. Supplier does

not guarantee that the software is suitable for the actual and/or

the intended use. Supplier does not guarantee either that the

software functions without interruptions and/or that all errors are

always repaired. Repairs are carried out free of charge unless

the software was developed on client’s instructions other than

for a fixed price, in which case supplier charges the costs of the

repairs to client at its applicable rates.

40.2 Supplier may charge the costs of the repairs to client at its

applicable rates if such repairs are required as a result of usage

errors or client not using the software properly, or as a result of

causes that cannot be attributed to supplier. The obligation to

repair errors ends if client modifies the software or has such

modifications implemented without supplier’s written

permission.

40.3 Errors are repaired at a location and in a manner to be

determined by supplier. Supplier is entitled to install temporary

solutions, program bypasses or problem-avoiding restrictions in

the software.

40.4 Supplier is never obliged to recover corrupted or lost data.

11/18



40.5 Supplier does not have any obligation whatsoever, of whatever

nature or content, with respect to errors reported after the end

of the guarantee period referred to in article 40.1.



Section 5. Development of software

and websites



The provisions in this section ‘Development of software

and websites’ apply, apart from the General provisions of

these general terms, if supplier develops and/or designs

software as described in Section 4 and/or websites for

client and possibly installs the software and/or websites.



Article 41 Specifications and development of

software and/of websites



41.1 Development always takes place under an agreement for

services. If no specifications or design of the software and/or

website to be developed have been provided before the

agreement is entered into or no specifications or design are

provided when the agreement is entered into, parties specify,

by consultation and in writing, the software and/or website to be

developed and the manner in which the software and/or

website will be developed.

41.2 Supplier develops the software and/or website with due care

and in accordance with the explicitly agreed specifications or

design and, where applicable, with due regard for the project

organisation, methods, techniques and/or procedures agreed

on in writing with client. Before starting the development

activities, supplier may require that client should agree to the

specifications or design in writing.

41.3 If no specific arrangements have been made in the matter,

supplier starts the design and/or development activities within a

reasonable period or time, to be determined by supplier, after

the agreement has been entered into.

41.4 At supplier’s request, client provides supplier with the

opportunity to perform activities at client’s premises outside the

usual working days and working hours.

41.5 Supplier’s obligations to perform with respect to the

development of a website do not include making a content

management system available.

41.6 If parties agree that, apart from development activities, supplier

also provides training courses, maintenance and/or support

and/or that supplier also applies for a domain name, supplier

may request that client should enter into a separate, written

agreement. Supplier charges client separately for these

services, at supplier’s applicable rates.

41.7 If supplier provides services to client in the context of a domain

name, such as the application for, renewal, alienation or

transfer to a third party of that name, client is obliged to observe

the rules and methods of the relevant authority or authorities. At

client’s request, supplier provides client with a written copy of

these rules. Supplier is explicitly neither responsible for the

correctness or the promptness of the services nor responsible

for achieving the results client intends to achieve. Client is

charged for all costs involved in the application and/or

registration at the agreed rates and, if no rates have been

agreed on, at supplier’s applicable rates. Supplier does not

guarantee that a domain name client should want to use will

actually be assigned to client.



Article 42 Agile development of

software/websites



42.1 If parties use an iterative development method – scrum, for

example – parties accept: (i) that, at the start, the activities are

not performed on the basis of complete or fully detailed

specifications; and (ii) that specifications which may or may not

have been agreed on at the start of the activities, may be

adapted during the term of the agreement, in mutual

consultation and with due observance of the project approach

that forms part of the development method concerned.

42.2 Before starting the activities to be performed in the context of

the agreement, parties put together one or more teams that

consist of representatives of both supplier and client. The team

ensures that the communication lines remain short and direct

and that consultations take place regularly. Parties provide for

the deployment, by both of them, of the capacity agreed on

(FTEs) in terms of team members in the roles and with the

knowledge and experience and the decision-making powers

required to perform the agreement. Parties accept that in order

to make the project successful, the capacity agreed on is a

minimum requirement. Parties endeavour to keep key staff

available that have been deployed in first instance, as much as

reasonably possible, until the end of the project, unless

circumstances should arise that are beyond parties’ control.

During the performance of the agreement, parties jointly decide,

by consultation, on the specifications that apply for the following

phase of the project – for example a time box – and/or for the

development of a following part. Client accepts the risk that the

software and/or the website may not necessarily meet all

specifications. Client ensures permanent and active input by

and contributions from relevant end users who are supported

by client’s organisation or company in the context of, among

other things, testing and (further) decision making. Client

guarantees expeditiousness in progress-related decisions that

have to be made during the performance of the agreement. If

client fails to make clear and prompt progress-related decisions

in conformity with the project approach that forms part of the

relevant development method, supplier is entitled, though not

obliged, to make the decisions that supplier considers to be

appropriate.

42.3 If parties have arranged for one or more test moments, a test

exclusively takes place on the basis of objective, measurable

criteria agreed on previously, such as confirming to

development standards. Errors and other imperfections are only

repaired if the responsible team decides so and this will be

carried out in a subsequent iteration. If an extra iteration should

be required, the costs are at client’s expense. After the last

development phase, supplier is not obliged to repair any errors

or other imperfections, unless explicitly agreed on otherwise in

writing.



Article 43 Delivery, installation and

acceptance



43.1 The provisions of article 35 with respect to delivery and

installation apply mutatis mutandis.

43.2 Unless supplier is obliged, under the agreement, to host the

software and/or website for client on its own computer system,

supplier either delivers the software and/or website to client on

a data carrier and in a form determined by supplier, or makes

the software and/or website online available to client.

43.3 The provisions of article 36 of these general terms with respect

to acceptance apply mutatis mutandis.

43.4 If parties make use of a development method as referred to in

article 42, the provisions of article 36.1, 36.2, article 36.4 up to

12/18



and including 36.9, article 36.12 and article 40.1 and 40.5 do

not apply. Client accepts the software and/or website in the

state it is in at the moment the last development phase ends

(‘as is, where is’).



Article 44 Right to use



44.1 Supplier makes the software and/or website developed on

client’s instructions, together with the relevant user

documentation, available to client for use.

44.2 The source code of the software and the technical

documentation prepared when the software is developed is only

made available to client if this has been agreed in on writing, in

which case client is entitled to modify the software.

44.3 Supplier is not obliged to make the auxiliary software and

program or data libraries required for the use and/or

maintenance of the software and/or website available to client.

44.4 The provisions of article 34 with respect to the right to use and

restrictions on the use apply mutatis mutandis.

44.5 Only if the content of the written agreement explicitly indicates

that all design and development costs are fully and exclusively

at client’s expense, restrictions on the use of the software

and/or website do not apply for client, contrary to the provisions

of article 44.4.



Article 45 Payment



45.1 If no payment scheme has been agreed on, all sums related to

the development of software and/or website become due and

payable, in arrears, per calendar month.

45.2 The price for the development activities includes payment for

the right to use the software and/or website for the term of the

agreement.

45.3 The payment for the development of the software and/or

website does not include payment for auxiliary software and

program and data libraries, and any installation services and

any modifications and/or maintenance of the software and/or

website required by client. The payment does not include

support services for the users of the software and/or website

either.



Article 46 Guarantees



46.1 The provisions of article 40 with respect to guarantees apply

mutatis mutandis.

46.2 Supplier does not guarantee that the software and/or website it

has developed function properly on all sorts of new versions of

web browser types and possibly other software and/or

websites. Supplier does not guarantee either that the software

and/or website function properly on all types of hardware.



Section 6. Maintenance and support of

software



The provisions in this section ‘Maintenance and support of

software’ apply, apart from the General provisions of these

general terms, if supplier provides services in the field of

software maintenance and software support for the use of

the software.



Article 47 Maintenance services



47.1 If agreed, supplier performs maintenance services for the

software specified in the agreement. The obligation to provide



maintenance includes repairing errors in the software in the

sense of article 36.3 and, only if this has been agreed in writing,

making new versions of the software available in accordance

with article 48.

47.2 Client is to report, in detail, any errors discovered in the

software. Following receipt of the report, supplier makes every

effort to repair errors and/or implement corrections in later, new

versions of the software in compliance with its applicable

procedures. Depending on the urgency and supplier’s version

and release policy, the results are made available to client in a

manner and within the period of time determined by supplier.

Supplier is entitled to install temporary solutions, program

bypasses or problem-avoiding restrictions in the software.

Client itself is responsible for installing, organising,

parameterising and tuning the corrected software or the new

version of the software made available, and, if necessary, for

modifying the hardware and operating environment used.

Supplier is never obliged to repair other imperfections than

those referred to in this article. In the event supplier is prepared

to correct other imperfections than those referred to in this

article, supplier is entitled to charge a separate fee for this.

47.3 The provisions of article 40.3 and 40.4 apply mutatis mutandis.

47.4 If supplier performs maintenance services online, client

ensures, in due time, that a properly and appropriately secured

infrastructure and network facilities are in place.

47.5 Client renders every assistance required by supplier for the

maintenance services, which includes that client should

temporarily stop using the software and should make a backup

of all data.

47.6 If maintenance concerns software that was not delivered to

client by supplier and if supplier believes this is necessary or

appropriate in the context of maintenance, client makes the

source code and the technical (development) documentation of

the software, including data models, designs, change logs and

the like, available to supplier. Client guarantees that it is entitled

to make the source code and documentation available. Client

grants supplier the right to use and modify the software,

including the source code and technical (development)

documentation, so that supplier can perform the maintenance

services agreed on.



Article 48 New versions of the software



48.1 Maintenance includes making new versions of the software

available only if and insofar as this has been agreed in writing.

If maintenance includes making new versions of the software

available, these new versions are made available at supplier’s

discretion.

48.2 Three months after an enhanced version has been made

available, supplier is no longer obliged to repair errors in the

previous version and to provide support and/or perform

maintenance services for a previous version.

48.3 Supplier may require that client should enter into an additional

written agreement with supplier for a version with new

functionality and that a further payment should be made for this

version. Supplier may incorporate functionality from a previous

version of the software in the new version without any

modifications, but supplier does not guarantee that each new

version includes the same functionality as the previous version.

Supplier is not obliged to maintain, modify or add particular

features or functionalities in the software especially for client.

48.4 Supplier may require that client should modify its system

(hardware, web browser, software and the like) if this should be

necessary for the proper functioning of a new version of the

software.

13/18



Article 49 Support services



49.1 If the services provided by supplier under the agreement

include support services to users and/or administrators of the

software, supplier advises – online, by telephone or by email –

on the use and functioning of the software specified in the

agreement. Client is obliged to specify the requests for support

as comprehensively and in as much detail as possible so that

supplier can respond appropriately. Supplier may set conditions

with respect to the way in which support is requested and the

qualifications and the number of persons eligible for support.

Supplier handles properly substantiated requests for support

within a reasonable period of time and in compliance with its

applicable procedures. Supplier does not guarantee the

correctness, completeness or timeliness of responses or of the

support offered. Support services are performed on working

days during supplier’s usual business hours.

49.2 If the services provided by supplier under the agreement

include standby services, supplier ensures that one or more

staff members are available on the days and at the times

specified in the agreement. If standby services have been

agreed on, client is entitled, in urgent cases, to call in the

support of staff members on standby if there are serious errors,

serious malfunctions and other serious imperfections in the

functioning of the software. Supplier does not guarantee that

these are promptly repaired.

49.3 The maintenance and other agreed services referred to in this

chapter are performed starting from the date on which the

agreement is entered into, unless parties have agreed

otherwise in writing.



Article 50 Payment



50.1 If no payment scheme has been explicitly agreed on, all sums

related to the maintenance of the software and other services

as meant in this section and set out in the agreement become

due and payable, in advance, per calendar month.

50.2 Sums relating to the maintenance of the software and the other

services as meant in this section and set out in the agreement

are payable when the agreement is entered into. Payment for

maintenance and other services is always due, regardless

whether client has taken the software into use and regardless

whether client actually makes use of the maintenance or

support services.



Section 7\. Advisory and consultancy

services



The provisions in this section ‘Advisory and consultancy

services’ apply, apart from the General provisions of these

general terms, if supplier provides services in the field of

advice and consultancy, which services are not provided

under client’s direction and supervision.



Article 51 Performance of advisory and

consultancy services



51.1 Supplier performs the advisory and consultancy services in a

fully independent manner, at its own discretion and without

client’s supervision and directions.

51.2 Supplier does not commit to a completion time of the

assignment because the completion time of an assignment in

the field of advisory or consultancy services depends on

various factors and circumstances, such as the quality of the



data and the information provided by client and the assistance

rendered by client and relevant third parties.

51.3 Supplier only performs its services on supplier’s usual working

days and during supplier’s usual business hours.

51.4 The use that client makes of any advisory and/or a consultancy

report drafted by supplier is always at client’s risk. The burden

of proof is on client to prove that the advisory and/or

consultancy services or the way in which these are performed

is not in compliance with that which has been agreed on in

writing or that which may be expected from a competent

supplier acting reasonably, without prejudice to supplier’s right

to provide evidence to the contrary, using any legal means.

51.5 Without supplier’s prior written permission, client may not

inform any third party about supplier’s way of working, methods

and techniques and/or the content of supplier’s

recommendations or reports. Client may not provide supplier’s

recommendations or reports to a third party or otherwise make

supplier’s recommendations or reports public.



Article 52 Reporting



52.1 Supplier periodically informs client, in the manner agreed on in

writing, about the performance of the services. Client informs

supplier, in advance and in writing, about circumstances of

importance or circumstances that could be of importance to

supplier, such as the manner of reporting, the issues to be

addressed, client’s prioritisation, the availability of client’s

resources and staff, and special facts or circumstances or facts

or circumstances of which supplier is possibly unaware. Client

ensures that the information provided by supplier is spread and

actually taken notice of within client’s organisation or company

and client assesses this information, also on this basis, and

informs supplier of this.



Article 53 Payment



53.1 If no payment scheme has been explicitly agreed on, all sums

related to the services provided by supplier as meant in this

section become due and payable, in arrears, per calendar

month.



Section 8. Secondment services



The provisions in this section ‘Secondment services’

apply, apart from the General provisions of these general

terms, if supplier makes one or more of its employees

available to client to perform activities under client’s

supervision and instructions.



Article 54 Secondment services



54.1 Supplier makes the employee specified in the agreement

available to perform activities under client’s direction and

supervision. The results of these activities are at client’s risk.

Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the employee is made

available to client for forty hours a week, during supplier’s usual

working days.

54.2 Client may only deploy the employee made available to perform

activities other than the activities agreed on if supplier has

agreed to this in advance and in writing.

54.3 Client may only second the employee made available to a third

party for the purpose of performing activities under that third

party’s direction and supervision if this has been explicitly

agreed in writing.

14/18



54.4 Supplier makes reasonable efforts to ensure that the employee

made available remains available, during the agreed days, to

perform activities for the term of the agreement, except in the

event of the employee’s incapacity for work or if the employee

leaves supplier's employment. Even if the agreement has been

entered into with a view to the activities being performed by one

particular person, supplier is always entitled, after consultations

with client, to replace this person by one or more persons who

have the same qualifications.

54.5 Client is entitled to request that the employee made available

should be replaced (i) if the employee made available

demonstrably fails to meet the quality requirements explicitly

agreed on and client informs supplier about this, stating

reasons, within three working days after the activities have

started, or (ii) in the event of the relevant employee’s prolonged

incapacity for work or if the employee leaves supplier's

employment. Supplier complies with such a request without

delay and as a matter of priority. Supplier does not guarantee

that the employee made available can always be replaced. If

the employee cannot be replaced or cannot be replaced

promptly, both client’s rights with respect to further performance

of the agreement and all client’s claims arising from non-

performance of the agreement lapse. Client’s payment

obligations with respect to the activities already performed

continue to apply in full.



Article 55 Duration secondment agreement



55.1 Notwithstanding the provisions of article 4 of these general

terms, if nothing has been agreed by parties considering the

duration of the secondment, the secondment agreement is

seen as an agreement for an indefinite period of time, in which

case either party must observe a notice period of one calendar

month following any initial term of the agreement. Termination

by serving notice of termination (opzegging) must be served in

writing.



Article 56 Working hours and working

conditions



56.1 The working hours, holiday periods, rest periods and other

relevant working conditions of the employee made available are

the same as those usually applied by client. Client guarantees

that the working hours, holiday periods, rest periods and other

relevant working conditions are in compliance with relevant

laws and regulations.

56.2 Client informs supplier about any intended temporary or

permanent closure of its organisation or company.



Article 57 Overtime pay and travel time



57.1 If, on client’s instructions or at client’s request, the employee

made available works more hours per day than the agreed or

usual number of working hours or works on days other than

supplier’s usual working days, client is charged for these hours

at the overtime rate agreed on, or, if no such rate has been

agreed on, at supplier’s applicable overtime rate. If so

requested, supplier informs client about its applicable overtime

rates.

57.2 Client is charged for travelling expenses and travel time in

accordance with supplier’s applicable rules and standards. If so

requested, supplier informs client about supplier’s applicable

rules and standards.



Article 58 Hirer’s liability and other liability



58.1 Supplier ensures that amounts payable in terms of payroll tax,

national insurance contributions, employee insurance

contributions, income-related healthcare contributions and

turnover tax for the employee made available under the

agreement with client are paid on time and in full. Supplier

indemnifies client against any and all claims of the Tax

Administration or authorities responsible for implementing

social insurance legislation that are due and payable under the

agreement with client, provided that client promptly informs

supplier, in writing, about such claims when they arise and

about the content of a claim and leaves the settlement of that

claim, including any arrangements to be made in this regard,

entirely up to supplier. Client provides supplier with the powers

of attorney and the information required and assists supplier in

defending itself, if necessary in client’s name, against such

claims.

58.2 Supplier does not accept any liability for the quality of the

results of the activities performed under client's supervision and

instructions.



Section 9. Training courses



The provisions in this section ‘Training courses’ apply,

apart from the General provisions of these general terms, if

supplier provides services, under whatever name and in

whatever way – for example in electronic form – in the field

of education, courses, workshops, trainings, seminars and

the like (hereinafter to be referred to as: training courses).



Article 59 Registration and cancellation



59.1 Registration for a training course must take place in writing and

is binding following its confirmation by supplier.

59.2 Client is responsible for the choice and suitability of the training

course for the participants. A participant’s lack of the required

prior knowledge does not affect client’s obligations under the

agreement. Client may replace a training course participant by

another participant following supplier’s written permission.

59.3 If, in supplier’s opinion, the number of registrations should give

rise to this, supplier is entitled to cancel the training course, to

combine it with one or more training courses or schedule it on a

later date or at a later time. Supplier reserves the right to

change the location of the training course. Supplier is entitled to

change the training course in organisational terms and in terms

of content.

59.4 If client or a participant cancels participation in a training

course, the consequences of the cancellation are governed by

supplier’s applicable rules. In any case, cancellation must take

place in writing and prior to the training course or the part of the

training course concerned. Cancellation or non-attendance

does not affect client’s payment obligations under the

agreement.



Article 60 Training courses



60.1 Client accepts that supplier determines the content and the

scope of the training course.

60.2 Client informs the participants about the obligations under the

agreement and the rules of conduct and other rules prescribed

by supplier for participation in the training course, and client

ensures compliance by participants with these obligations and

rules.

15/18



60.3 If supplier uses its own hardware or software in the training

course, supplier does not guarantee that this hardware or

software is free of errors and operates without interruption. If

the training course is at client’s premises, client ensures that an

appropriate classroom and properly operating hardware and

software are available. In the event the facilities at client’s

premises appear not meet the requirements and the quality of

the training course, therefore, cannot be guaranteed, supplier is

entitled not to start or to shorten the training course or to stop it

altogether.

60.4 The agreement does not include administering an exam or a

test.

60.5 Client is separately charged for the documentation, training

materials or training resources made available or produced for

the training course. This also applies for possible training

course certificates or duplicates of training course certificates.

60.6 If the training course takes place as an e-learning training

course, the provisions of the section ‘Software-as-a-Service

(SaaS)’ apply mutatis mutandis as much as possible.



Article 61 Price and payment



61.1 Supplier may require that client should pay the sums due prior

to the start of the training course. Suppler may exclude

participants from participating in the training course if client fails

to ensure the payment is made in time, without prejudice to any

other rights supplier may have.

61.2 If supplier has carried out a preliminary study to make a training

course plan or has given training course recommendations,

client may be separately charged for any costs involved.

61.3 Unless supplier has explicitly indicated that the training course

is VAT exempt within the meaning of article 11 of the Turnover

Tax Act 1968, VAT is payable on client’s payment. Supplier is

entitled to adjust its prices after the agreement has been

entered into in the event of any changes in the VAT regime for

training courses as this applies under or pursuant to the law.



Section 10\. Hosting



The provisions in this section ‘Hosting’ apply, apart from

the General provisions of these general terms, if supplier

provides services, under whatever name, in the field of

hosting and hosting-related services.



Article 62 Hosting services



62.1 Supplier performs the hosting services agreed on with client.

62.2 If the agreement’s object is to make hard disk space available,

client may not exceed the agreed disk space unless the

agreement explicitly arranges for the consequences of doing

so. The agreement pertains to making disk space available on

a server specifically reserved for client only insofar as this has

been explicitly agreed in writing. All use of disk space, data

traffic and other use made of systems and infrastructure is

restricted to the maximums agreed on by parties. Data traffic

that is not used by client in a given period may not be

transferred to a subsequent period. If the agreed maximums

are exceeded, supplier charges client for an additional

compensation at its applicable rates.

62.3 Client is responsible for the management, including checks of

the settings, and use of the hosting service, and the way in

which the results of the service are implemented. If no specific

arrangements have been made in this regard, client itself is

responsible for installing, organising, parameterising and tuning



the software and auxiliary software, and, where required,

modifying the hardware and user environment used and for

effecting the interoperability wanted. Supplier is not obliged to

perform data conversion.

62.4 Only if this has been explicitly agreed in writing, the

agreement’s object also is to ensure security, back-up,

contingency and recovery services or to make these available.

62.5 Supplier may temporarily put all or part of the hosting service

out of operation for preventive, corrective or adaptive

maintenance. Supplier ensures that the period of time during

which the service is out of operation does not take longer than

necessary and also ensures, where possible, that this takes

place outside office hours, and, according to circumstances,

have this commence after client has been consulted.

62.6 If, under the agreement, supplier provides services to client in

the context of a domain name, such as the application for,

renewal, alienation or transfer to a third party of that name,

client is obliged to observe the rules and methods of the

relevant organisation or organisations. At client’s request,

supplier provides client with a written copy of these rules.

Supplier is explicitly neither responsible for the correctness or

the promptness of the services nor responsible for achieving

the results client intends to achieve. Client is charged for all

costs involved in the application and/or registration at the

agreed rates and, if no rates have been agreed on, at supplier’s

applicable rates. Supplier does not guarantee that a domain

name client should want to use will actually be assigned to

client.



Article 63 Notice and Take Down



63.1 At all times, client acts with due care and does not act

unlawfully vis-à-vis third parties, more in particular by

respecting the intellectual property rights and other rights of

third parties and the privacy of third parties, by refraining from

spreading information in a manner that is in violation of the law,

from granting unauthorised access to systems and from

spreading viruses or other harmful programs or data, and by

refraining from committing criminal offences and violating any

other legal obligations.

63.2 To prevent liability to third parties or limit the consequences,

supplier is always entitled to take measures with respect to an

act or omission of or at client’s risk. At supplier’s first request in

writing, client promptly removes data and/or information from

supplier’s systems. If client fails to do so, supplier is entitled, at

its own option, to delete the data and/or information itself or to

make access to the data and/or information impossible. In

addition, in the event of a breach or an imminent breach of the

provisions of article 63.1, supplier is entitled to deny client

access to supplier’s systems with immediate effect and without

prior notice. All of this is without prejudice to supplier taking any

other measures or exercising any other statutory and

contractual rights with respect to client. Supplier is also entitled

in this case to terminate the agreement by serving notice of

termination (opzeggen) with immediate effect without being

liable to client for doing so.

63.3 Supplier cannot be expected to form an opinion on the validity

of the claims of third parties or of client’s defence, or to become

involved, in any way whatsoever, in any dispute between a third

party and client. Client is to deal with the relevant third party in

this matter and is to inform supplier in writing, properly

substantiated and supported by documents.

16/18



Section 11. Hardware purchases



The provisions in this section ‘Hardware purchases’ apply,

apart from the General provisions of these general terms, if

supplier sells hardware, of whatever nature, and/or other

goods (corporeal objects) to client.



Article 64 Purchase and sale



64.1 Supplier sells the hardware and/or other goods according to the

nature and number agreed on in writing.

64.2 Supplier does not guarantee that the hardware and/or goods

are suitable, on delivery, for client’s actual and/or intended use

unless the intended purposes have been clearly specified,

without caveats, in the written agreement.

64.3 Supplier’s obligation to sell does not include assembly and

installation of materials, software, consumer items and articles,

batteries, stamps, ink and ink cartridges, toner articles, cables

and accessories.

64.4 Supplier does not guarantee that the assembly, installation and

operating instructions that come with the hardware and/or

goods are free of errors and that the hardware and/or goods

have the features stated in these instructions.



Article 65 Delivery



65.1 The hardware and/or goods sold by supplier to client are

delivered to client ex warehouse. If this has been agreed on in

writing, supplier delivers the goods sold to client at a location to

be designated by client, or has these goods delivered at this

location. In this case, supplier informs client, if possible in good

time before the delivery, about the time when supplier or the

transporter contracted by supplier intends to deliver the

hardware and/or goods.

65.2 The purchase price of the hardware and/or goods does not

include the costs of transportation, insurance, hauling and

hoisting, the hiring of temporary facilities and the like. If

applicable, client is charged for these costs.

65.3 If client requests supplier to remove or destroy old materials –

such as networks, cabinets, cable ducts, packaging materials,

hardware or data on hardware – or if supplier is legally obliged

to do so, supplier may accept this request on the basis of a

written order and at its applicable rates. If and insofar as

supplier is prohibited by law from requiring payment, for

example in the context of the old-for-new scheme, supplier

does not charge, where applicable, any costs.

65.4 Provided parties have entered into a written agreement to

arrange for this, supplier is responsible for installing, configuring

and connecting the hardware and/or goods or for having the

hardware and/or goods installed, configured and connected.

Any obligation of supplier to install and/or configure hardware

neither includes data conversion nor software installation.

Supplier is not responsible for obtaining any of the licences

possibly required.

65.5 Supplier is always entitled to perform the agreement in partial

deliveries.



Article 66 Test setup



66.1 Supplier is only obliged to set up a test environment for the

hardware client is interested in if this has been agreed in

writing. Supplier may attach financial and other conditions to a

test setup. A test setup involves making the standard version of

the hardware temporarily available on approval, excluding

accessories, in a space made available by client, prior to



client’s final decision on whether or not to purchase the

hardware in question. Client is liable for the use of, damage to

and theft or loss of the hardware that forms part of a test setup.



Article 67 Requirements hardware environment



67.1 Client ensures an environment that meets the requirements

specified by supplier for the hardware and/or goods, among

other things in terms of temperature, humidity and technical

requirements.

67.2 Client ensures that activities to be performed by third parties,

such as constructional work, are performed adequately and on

time.



Article 68 Guarantees



68.1 Supplier makes every effort to repair defects in the material and

manufacturing defects in the hardware and/or goods sold, as

well as defects in parts delivered by supplier within the scope of

the guarantee, within a reasonable period of time and free of

charge if these defects are reported, in detail, to supplier within

a period of three months following delivery. If, in supplier’s

reasonable opinion, the defects cannot be repaired or repair

would take too long, or if repair would entail disproportionately

high costs, supplier is entitled to replace the hardware and/or

goods free of charge with other, similar, though not necessarily

identical, hardware and/or goods. The guarantee does not

include any data conversion that should be required because of

any repair or replacement. All replaced parts are supplier’s

property. The guarantee obligation no longer applies if defects

in the hardware, goods or parts are entirely or partly caused by

incorrect, careless or incompetent use or by external

circumstances such as fire or water damage, or if client

modifies the hardware or parts delivered by supplier under the

guarantee, or has these modified, without supplier’s permission.

Supplier does not withhold such permission on unreasonable

grounds.

68.2 Client cannot file any claims or further claims concerning non-

Article 70 Prior inspection



70.1 By way of prior inspection, supplier may draft a report, in

client’s presence and prior to making the hardware available or

when it is made available, describing the state of the hardware,

including any defects observed. Supplier may require that client

should sign this report, prior to making the hardware available

to client for use, to indicate client’s agreement with the text of

the report. The defects in the hardware listed in this report are

at supplier’s account. If any defects are observed, parties

arrange whether, and if so, how and when, the defects listed in

the report must be repaired.

70.2 If client does not properly cooperate in the prior inspection

referred to in Article 70.1, supplier is entitled to carry out this

prior inspection without client being present and to draft the

report itself. This report is binding on client.

70.3 If no prior inspection is carried out, client is deemed to have

received the hardware in a proper and undamaged state.



Article 71 Use of the hardware



71.1 Client exclusively uses the hardware in and for its own

organisation or company, in compliance with the hardware’s

intended use under the agreement and at the premises

specified in the agreement. Use of the hardware by or for the

benefit of third parties is not permitted. The right to use the

hardware is non-transferable. Client is not permitted to lease

the hardware to a third party or otherwise enable a third party to

use the hardware or to make use of it together with client.

71.2 Client itself is responsible for installing and assembling the

hardware and making it ready for use.

71.3 Client is not permitted to use the hardware or any part of it as a

security or collateral, in any way whatsoever, or to dispose of

the hardware or any part of it in another way.

71.4 Client uses and maintains the hardware with due care. Client

takes adequate measures to prevent any damage to the

hardware. Should there be any damage, client promptly informs

supplier about this. For the term of the lease, client is always

liable to supplier for damage to the hardware and theft, loss or

misappropriation of the hardware.

71.5 Client is neither permitted to modify the hardware, either

entirely or partly, nor permitted to add anything to it. If any

modifications or additions have nevertheless been made, client

is obliged to undo or remove these modifications or additions

no later than at the end of the lease agreement.

71.6 Parties agree that defects in the modifications or additions

made to the hardware by or under client’s instructions and all

defects in the hardware caused by those modifications or

defects are not considered defects within the sense of article

7:204 of the Netherlands Civil Code. Client can never file a

claim against supplier with respect to such defects. Supplier is

not obliged to carry out repairs or perform maintenance

services with respect to such defects.

71.7 Client is not entitled to any compensation for modifications or

additions made by client to the leased hardware if these

modifications or additions are not undone or removed, for any

reason whatsoever, when or after the lease agreement ends.

71.8 Client promptly informs supplier in writing when the hardware is

provisionally attached, stating the identity of the attaching party

and the reason for the attachment. Client promptly allows the

Article 72 Maintenance of the leased hardware



72.1 Client is not allowed to maintain the leased hardware itself or

have the hardware maintained by a third party.

72.2 Client promptly informs supplier in writing about any defects

that it observes in the leased hardware. Supplier makes every

effort, within a reasonable period of time and by means of

corrective maintenance, to repair defects in the hardware that

are at supplier’s account. Supplier is also entitled, though not

obliged, to perform preventive maintenance services on the

hardware. If so requested, client provides supplier with the

opportunity to perform corrective and/or preventive

maintenance services. Parties determine together, by

consultation and in advance, the dates on which and the times

at which maintenance services must be performed. Client is not

entitled to replacement hardware during periods of time

maintenance services are performed.

72.3 Supplier’s obligation to repair defects excludes:

● repairing defects that client accepted when entering into the

lease agreement;

● repairing defects that are caused by external

circumstances;

● repairing defects that can be attributed to client, its staff

members and/or third parties contracted by client;

● repairing defects that are caused by careless, incorrect or

incompetent use or use that is contrary to the use

described in the documentation;

● repairing defects that are related to the use of parts or

consumer articles that have not been recommended or

authorised by supplier;

● repairing defects that are caused by the hardware being

used in a manner that is contrary to its designated use;

● repairing defects that are caused by unauthorised

modifications of or additions to the hardware.

72.4 If supplier repairs the defects referred to in the preceding

paragraph or has such defects repaired, client is charged, at

supplier’s applicable rates, for the costs incurred by the repairs

carried out.

72.5 Supplier is always entitled to decide against repairing the

defects and to replace the hardware with other, similar, though

not necessarily identical, hardware.

73.2 Prior to or no later than on the last working day of the lease’s

term, client renders its assistance in a joint, final inspection of

the hardware’s condition. The findings of this final inspection

are laid down in a report to be jointly drafted by parties. This

report must be signed by both parties. If client does not render

assistance in the final inspection, supplier is entitled to carry out

this inspection without client being present and to draft the

report itself. This report is binding on client.

73.3 Supplier is entitled to have the defects that are listed in the final

inspection report and that are – within reason – at client’s risk

and expense, repaired at client’s expense. Client is liable for

any loss supplier suffers because the hardware is temporarily

out of operation or because supplier cannot lease the hardware

to a third party.

73.4 If, at the end of the term of the lease, client has not undone a

modification or removed an addition that client implemented in

18/18



the hardware, parties agree that client is deemed to have

waived any and all rights to those modifications and/or

additions.

the time that supplier has the hardware that has to be

maintained in its possession.

74.3 The content and scope of the maintenance services to be

that have been reported by client in an appropriate way. In

these general terms, ‘malfunction’ means non-compliance of

the hardware with the hardware specifications explicitly made

malfunction only exists if client cannot only demonstrate but

also reproduce this malfunction. Supplier is also entitled,

though not obliged, to perform preventive maintenance.

74.4 Client promptly informs supplier of a malfunction in the

hardware, by providing a detailed description of it, when this

malfunction occurs.

74.5 Client renders all assistance required by supplier in the context

of maintenance services, for example to temporarily stop using

the hardware. Client grants supplier’s staff or third parties

designated by supplier access to the location of the hardware,

renders the assistance required and makes the hardware

available to supplier so that the maintenance services can be

performed.

74.6 Client ensures that a complete and properly functioning backup

is made of all software and data recorded in or on the hardware

before the hardware is made available to supplier for

maintenance.

74.7 At supplier’s request, one of client’s staff who is an expert in the

matter at hand is present for consultation when the

maintenance services are performed.

74.8 Client is authorised to connect hardware and systems not

delivered by supplier to the hardware and install software on

that hardware.

74.9 If, in supplier’s opinion, maintenance of the hardware should

require testing the hardware’s connections with other hardware

or software, client makes both the other hardware and software

in question and the test procedures and data carriers available

to supplier.

74.10 Testing material required for maintenance that is not included in

supplier’s normal range of hardware is to be made available by

client.

74.11 Client bears the risk of loss or theft of, or damage to, the

hardware during the time that supplier has the hardware that

has to be maintained in its possession. It is up to client to take



out insurance against this risk.



Article 75 Maintenance fees



75.1 The maintenance fee does not include:

● costs of consumer articles, or of replacing these articles,

such as batteries, stamps, ink and ink cartridges, toner

● costs of parts, or of replacing these parts, and of

maintenance to repair malfunctions that were entirely or

partly caused by attempts at repair by parties other than

supplier;

● activities performed for overhaul of the hardware;

● modifications of the hardware;

● moving, relocating or reinstalling hardware, or costs for

transportation where hardware is to be repaired or any

other activities arising from these activities.

75.2 The maintenance fee is due regardless whether client has put

the hardware to use and makes use of it and regardless

whether client makes use of the maintenance option.



Article 76 Exclusions



76.1 Activities performed to investigate or repair malfunctions that

are caused by or connected with user errors, improper use of

the hardware or external circumstances such as failures of

internet services, data network connections, power supplies or

connections to hardware, software or materials that do not

come under the maintenance agreement, do not fall within the

scope supplier’s obligations under the maintenance agreement.

76.2 Supplier’s obligations with respect to maintenance do not cover:

● investigating or repairing malfunctions that are caused by or

connected with a modification of the hardware carried out

by a party other than supplier or a party acting on behalf of

supplier;

and client’s failure to have the hardware maintained in time.

Supplier’s maintenance obligations do not include investigating

or repairing malfunctions in the software installed on the

hardware.

76.3 Any costs incurred by maintenance services and/or

investigations carried out under articles 76.1 and/or 76.2 can be
