Services
--------

These Terms of Service (these “Terms”) apply to the features and functions provided by Adscore Technologies DMCC (“Adscore,” “our,” or “we”) via adscore.com (the “Site”) (collectively, the “Services”). By accessing or using the Site or the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you are not allowed to use the Site or the Services. The “Effective Date” of these Terms is the date you first use the Site, or access any of the Services.

If you are using the Site or accessing the Services in your capacity as an employee, consultant or agent of a company or other entity, you represent that you are an employee, consultant or agent of that company or entity, and that you have the authority to bind that company or entity to these Terms. For the purpose of these Terms, you (and, if applicable, the company or entity that you represent) will be referred to as “Client” or “you”.

Adscore reserves the right to change or modify these Terms, or any of our other policies or guidelines, at any time upon notice to you. We may provide that notice in a variety of ways, including, without limitation, sending you an email, posting a notice on the Site, or posting the revised Terms on the Site and revising the date at the top of these Terms. Any changes or modifications will be effective after we provide notice that these Terms have been modified. You acknowledge that your continued use of the Site or any of the Services following such notice constitutes your acceptance of the modified Terms.

Adscore reserves the right – at any time, and without notice or liability to you – to modify the Site or the Services, or any part of them, temporarily or permanently. We may modify the Services for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, for the purpose of providing new features, implementing new protocols, maintaining compatibility with emerging standards, or complying with regulatory requirements.

These Terms form a binding agreement between you and Adscore. Violation of any of the Terms below will result in the termination of your account(s).

You agree that you will be responsible for all Content on your account(s), even if placed there by third parties. By publishing or uploading Content to the Site or the Services, you represent and warrant that:

1.

2. You have obtained all rights and permissions necessary to publish and/or use the Content in the manner in which you have published and/or used it
3. Adscore’s use of the Content for the purpose of providing the Services (including, without limitation, downloading, copying, processing, or creating aggregations of the Content) does not and will not:

    2. or violates or misappropriates the Intellectual Property Rights of any third party,
    3. or is in any way harmful or objectionable.

Fees and Payment Terms
----------------------

Pricing for the Services are displayed on the Site in CPM (“cost per thousand impressions”). In the context of the Adscore Services, an impression is when a web page has been seen successfully fetched and seen by a visitor, whether it is a real human or a bot. Detailed information regarding Pricing for the Services and the way it applies in regards to the number of Impressions that you are routing through the service can be found on the Pricing Page: [https://www.adscore.com/pricing](https://www.adscore.com/pricing). Additionally, you acknowledge and agree with the following terms:

1. Your account will get automatically moved to a less expensive pricing tier based on the number of impressions you have generated within a day.
2. In the event that your account will see a decrease in traffic over a period of 3 consecutives months, below the threshold of your current tier, we reserve the right to downgrade your tier accordingly.
3. Each new Adscore account comes with a Trial Period credit of US$5 that can be used within 30 days of creating the account, to test the Services.
4. In exchange for your rights to access the Site and use the Services, after you have exhausted the Trial credits or exceeded the Trial Period, you will need to deposit funds to your Adscore account using the payment tools made available to you via the Adscore Dashboard, to be able to use the Service; the Service currently supports deposits only via PayPal transfers in U.S. Dollars.
5. All Adscore accounts function under “in advance”, “pre-paid” payment terms. This means that:
    
    1. You will need to keep your account’s balance positive, above US$0 (zero) to be able to use the service
    2. You understand that maintaining your account balance positive is your responsibility and failing to do so will infer your account being deactivated alongside the loss of any and all functionality that you currently have configured within the Service. We do not accept any liability for such loss.
    3. The Services will only be restored once you have made a deposit to your account that at least should cover an existing negative balance, plus US$10 to ensure that the Services can continue to function for a short while.
6. The deposited amount does not include any taxes; you will be responsible for, and will promptly pay, all taxes associated with your use of the Site and the Services, other than taxes based on our net income.
    

At any given time, you can withdraw available funds deposited for The Services and associated with your account, by contacting Support.
