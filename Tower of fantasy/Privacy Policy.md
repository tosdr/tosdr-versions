6.            Your Rights
=========================

_Some jurisdictions’ laws grant specific rights to users of the Game._ **Please refer to the Supplemental Jurisdiction-Specific Terms, or the applicable laws in your jurisdiction, for an overview of specific rights that apply to persons subject to data protection laws in the listed jurisdictions and how these can be exercised.**

You may have certain rights in relation to the personal information we hold about you. Some of these only apply in certain circumstances (as set out in more detail below). You can exercise some of these rights directly by accessing and updating the information in your account. If you believe we hold any other personal information about you, please [**contact us**](#_Contact_&_Complaints).

**_Access_**

You may have the right to access personal information we hold about you, how we use it, and who we share it with. You can access the personal information you have made available as part of your account by logging into your account.

**_Portability_**

You may have the right to receive a copy of certain personal information we process about you. For example, in certain jurisdictions this can comprise personal information we process on the basis of your consent (e.g., survey information) or pursuant to our contract with you (e.g., account name), as described above in the section “[_How We Use Your Personal Information_](#_How_We_Use)”. We will provide further information to you about transferring this data if you make such a request.

**_Correction_**

You may have the right to correct personal information we hold that is inaccurate. You can access the personal information we hold about you by logging into your Game account.

**_Erasure_**

You may be able to delete your account, or remove certain personal information, by logging into your Game account. We may need to retain personal information if there are valid grounds under data protection laws for us to do so (for example, for the defence of legal claims or freedom of expression) but we will let you know if that is the case.

**_Restriction of Processing to Storage Only_**

You may have a right to require that we stop processing the personal information we hold about you (other than for storage purposes in certain circumstances). Please note, however, that if we stop processing the personal information, we may use it again if there are valid grounds under data protection laws for us to do so (for example, for the defence of legal claims or for another’s protection). Where we agree to stop processing the personal information, we will take steps to tell any third party to whom we have disclosed the relevant personal information so that they can stop processing it too.

**_Objection_**

You may have the right to object to our processing of your personal information. If you wish to do so, please contact us using our online form for submitting data privacy related request and question at [https://dsar.toweroffantasy-global.com/tchk?id=tof](https://dsar.toweroffantasy-global.com/tchk?id=tof%20) or using the contact details set out below, and we will consider your request.

**_Consent Withdrawal_**

To the extent provided by applicable laws and regulations, you may withdraw consent you previously provided to us for certain processing activities by contacting us using our online form for submitting data privacy related request and question at [https://dsar.toweroffantasy-global.com/tchk?id=tof](https://dsar.toweroffantasy-global.com/tchk?id=tof). Where consent is required to process your personal information, if you do not consent to the processing or if you withdraw your consent we may not be able to deliver the expected service. Please note that the right to withdraw consent is only available if the legal basis for processing information is consent.

**_Announcements_**

We may from time to time send you announcements when we consider it necessary to do so (for example, when we temporarily suspend access to the Game for maintenance, or security, privacy or administrative-related communications). These are essential system and Game-related announcements and you are not able to opt-out of these notifications, which are not promotional in nature.

**INFORMATION FOR PARENTS**

Before your child can use Tower of Fantasy (the “**Game**”), you will need to provide your consent to approve your child’s account set-up and the processing of their personal information.

**What personal information does the Game process?**

Tower of Fantasy is a PC and mobile game.

If your child successfully signs up to the Game, this will result in the collection and sharing of certain personal information, including:

* account registration information such as nickname, language, region and profile picture;
* device information (including IP address and device identifiers) which is used to register each account, maintain the game environment, ensure optimal performance and security, and troubleshoot bugs;
* Identifier for Vendors (IDFV)/Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA)/Google Advertising ID, which is used solely to manage our promotion campaigns (there is no advertising within the Game);
* game data, log data and gameplay statistics (to provide the Game and save game progress);
* survey responses (if they choose to participate in game feedback surveys from time to time); and
* customer support information (if they contact customer support).

You can review our Privacy Policy for more details on what personal information we collect and how we use and process the information.

**Does** **the Game process personal information differently for children?**

Yes. In some jurisdictions children will not be able to access certain features – such as in-game free text and audio chats.

**Why is my consent required?**

Certain jurisdictions require or recommend the consent of a parent or legal guardian before their child can sign up to a game such as Tower of Fantasy, where personal information will be processed. If you do not consent, or withdraw your consent, we will immediately delete any personal information collected up to that point.

**What method(s) can I use to verify my child’s account?**

In some jurisdictions, including the United States, we ask for date of birth at registration. We will not allow a child to sign-up without first obtaining verifiable consent from that child’s parent or legal guardian. As part of this, we need to verify that you are an adult capable of providing such consent. To do this, we charge or authorize a small amount to a credit card. This process is handled by specify name of third party payment processor. We do not process your credit card information – only the third party payment processor collects credit card information. The credit card information is not retained for any reason, including future purchases or connected to in-app payment functions (if any) in the game.

**What if there are changes to** **the Game in the future?**

If we make any changes to the way their personal information is processed, we will notify you of those changes. You must consent to those changes before your child’s personal information will be processed for that new purpose.

**Will you retain my personal information?**

We will keep a record of your email address so that we can notify you of any changes to the processing of your child’s personal information, and so that we know you are a parent or legal guardian of a player when you contact us. As mentioned above, your credit card information is not processed by us, but instead only processed by a third party payment processor. We do not have access to your credit card information.

**What if I do not consent?**

If you do not consent (including by providing your credit card details for verification) then your contact information will be deleted.

**How do I withdraw my consent or delete my child’s account?**

You can withdraw your consent or delete your child’s account by submitting a request through our online form for data privacy related request and question at [https://dsar.toweroffantasy-global.com/tchk?id=tof](https://dsar.toweroffantasy-global.com/tchk?id=tof). You can also request a copy of your child’s personal information at any time using this form.
