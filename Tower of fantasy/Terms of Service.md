2.              What is this document? When can I play?
=======================================================

This is the agreement between you and us for our services you download or access, whether that’s a game, something that supports the game, or something else. You can only use these things once you agree to these terms.

You are now reading our End User License Agreement (“**EULA**”) which is a legal agreement between you and Proxima Beta Pte. Limited (“**we**”, “**us**”, “**our**”, as appropriate) regarding the Services you use from us. The “**Services**” mean collectively, and sometimes individually, the following: (a) each of our Games, and (b) any websites, software or other services we provide with or in support of the Game, whether or not they are installed or used on a computer, console, or a mobile device. “**Game**” means our game that you download and access that is subject to this EULA, regardless of where you download and/or access it, and any documentation, software, updates, Virtual Goods and Content (each defined below) included in it.

We’ve tried  to be straightforward in this EULA, and if you have any questions feel free to send us a note at support@toweroffantasy-global.com (our “**Support Email Address**”).  You’ll notice that we added some text in italics throughout the EULA to make it easier to read; however, this text is provided for guidance only, and does not form part of the EULA.

3.              Defined Terms
=============================

You’ll notice some capitalized terms in this EULA. They’re called “defined terms,” and we use them so we don’t have to repeat the same language again and again, and to make sure that the use of these terms is consistent throughout the EULA.  We’ve included the defined terms throughout because we want it to be easy for you to read them in context.

4.              Additional Terms
================================

Some Services may be available (or only available) through accessing (or downloading from) a third-party platform or store, including but not limited to, Facebook, the Epic Games Store, Steam game platform, the Google Play Store and Apple App Store (each, an “**App Store**”). Your use of the Services is also governed by any applicable agreements you have with any App Store (the “**App Store Agreement(s)**”). In the event of a conflict between any other App Store Agreement(s) from which you acquire one of our Games and this EULA with respect to your use of the Services, this EULA will take priority.

The collection of information from you and related to the Services (whether obtained through an App Store or not) is governed by our Privacy Policy at \[www.toweroffantasy-global.com/PrivacyPolicy.html\]. Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose information that we collect from and about you.

5.              Eligibility and Registration
============================================

The Services we offer have certain age restrictions. Others may require an outside account. When you give us information, you need to make sure it stays up to date. Also, don’t share your account with others without our permission.

(a)            Age. To create a Game Account (as defined below) and access some of our Services, you must be at least the minimum age for consenting to personal data collection under the law in your jurisdiction. If you are between the minimum age for personal data collection and age of majority in your jurisdiction, your parent or guardian must review this EULA and accept it on your behalf. Parents and guardians are responsible for the acts of their children under 18 years of age when using our Services. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We may allow a minor under the minimum age for personal data collection to register for certain Services with the verified consent of a parent or legal guardian. The parent/legal guardian may be asked to provide additional documentation or perform additional actions as part of the verification and approval process as consistent with applicable law. We recommend that parents and guardians familiarize themselves with parental controls on the devices they provide their child.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(b)            Account Creation. To access parts of a Game, you may need to create an in-game account (your “**Game Account**”). Your Game Account, if applicable, is separate from any account you may have with any App Store (your “**App Store Account**”). You may be able to create your Game Account using an existing account you have with us or your email address. To the extent you create your Game Account through the use of a third-party account (for example, your account with Facebook or Google), we may access certain personal information that this third party provides to us such as your email address and name to help create your Game Account. Further information about use of third-party accounts is provided in the Privacy Policy at \[www.toweroffantasy-global.com/PrivacyPolicy.html\]. Please note that you may also be able to play the Game without creating a Game Account, but you may not be able to access certain parts of the Game, and your Game data may be deleted if you uninstall or otherwise delete the Game.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(c)             Keep Your Information Current. It’s important that you provide us with accurate, complete, and up-to-date information for your Game Account, and you agree to update such information to keep it that way. If you don’t, we may suspend or terminate your Game Account. You agree that you will not disclose your Game Account password to anyone, and will notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your Game Account. You are responsible for all activities that occur under your Game Account, whether or not you know about them.  If you believe that your Game Account is no longer secure, then you must immediately notify us at our Support Email Address.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(d)            No Account Sharing. You may not sell, resell, rent, lease, share or provide access to your Game Account to anyone else. We reserve all available legal rights and remedies to prevent unauthorized use of our Services, including, but not limited to, technological barriers, IP mapping, and, in serious cases, directly contacting your Internet Service Provider (ISP) regarding such unauthorized use.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(e)            No False Accounts. You may not create a Game Account for anyone else or create a Game Account in a name other than your own.

6.              License and Use of the Services
===============================================

As long as you agree to this EULA (and as long as the EULA isn’t terminated—see Section 21), we grant you permission to access and use our Services. If you break the rules or can’t agree, we can’t let you play. Please ensure your system and devices meet the minimum requirements for the Game. Also, if you suffer from an epileptic condition, please talk to a doctor before playing the Game.

(a)            License Grant. So long as you comply with this EULA and, as applicable, the App Store Agreement(s), we grant you the following license: a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable limited right and license to (i) download and install the Game on the device permitted by the App Store Agreement(s) (if applicable), and (ii) access and use the Services, including any Content, for your personal entertainment purposes leveraging only the functionality of the Game and Services.

(b)            Content You Create Outside the Services. “**User Content**” means any Content that you (or other Game Account holders) create or obtain outside the Services that you or another user makes available within the Services. To be clear, if Content is created within the Services, it is not User Content; only Content created or obtained from outside the Services that a user then makes available within the Services is User Content. By making any User Content available through the Services, you hereby grant to us the following license: a non-exclusive, transferable, worldwide, royalty-free license, with the right to sublicense, to use, copy, modify, create derivative works based upon, distribute, publicly display, and publicly perform your User Content in connection with operating and providing the Services and Content to you and to other users of the Services. Except to the extent prohibited by law, you waive the benefit of any “moral rights” or “droit moral” or similar rights in any country to any User Content.  We may, in our sole discretion, remove, edit, or disable any User Content at any time and for any reason, including if we determine that the User Content violates this EULA. We do not assume any responsibility or liability for User Content, for removing it, or not removing it or other Content. We do not pre-screen or review any User Content, and do not approve or endorse any User Content that may be available on the Services or our other services.

(c)             Service Limits Based on Where You Live. We may restrict, modify, or limit your access to and use of certain Content, Virtual Goods, an entire Game, or any or all of the Services, depending on the territory in which you are located. Without limiting the foregoing, Content, Virtual Goods, entire Games, or the Services may not be available (in whole or in part) where you are located or may only be available in a modified version, if they do not comply with the laws which apply in your country.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(d)            Retail Purchase_._ We may offer codes or product keys that can be activated in a Game or used to activate a Game on the App Store. Subject to foreign exchange control regulations applicable in your jurisdiction, such codes or keys must be purchased (or otherwise obtained legally) through us or one of our authorized retailers to be valid. If you purchase such a code or key from a third party, that third party is responsible for addressing any issues you have with these codes or keys. Subject to applicable law, we will have no responsibility for these codes or keys purchased from any third party or if any purchase occurred in breach with any applicable foreign exchange control regulations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.              Ownership of the Services
=========================================

Our Services including our Content and Games are owned by us or our licensors. Our Services may let you upload, post and store photos and other content that you own. You retain your ownership of this content, to which we take a license.  

We and our affiliates and licensors own all title, ownership, and intellectual property rights in the Services. You agree not to remove, alter, or obscure any copyright, trademark, service mark, or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Services.  You understand and agree that you have no ownership interest in the Services or any Games or Content therein.

The Services (and particularly our Games) may have built-in mechanisms designed to prevent granting one user an unfair advantage over other users (these actions are “**Cheating**” and the software is the “**Cheat Detection Software**”). We may add or update our Cheat Detection Software periodically as we may require in our sole discretion. The Services and/or the Cheat Detection Software may collect and transmit details about your Game Account, gameplay, and unauthorized programs or processes in connection with Cheating, subject to our Privacy Policy and applicable law. In the event that we in our sole discretion conclude that you are Cheating, you agree that we may exercise any or all of our rights under this EULA, including termination of this EULA and your access to our Services. In addition, if you Cheat in one Game or Service, we may terminate your license to use all of our Games and Services.

Although we are not obligated to monitor access to or use of the Services or to review or edit any Content, we have the right to do so for the purpose of operating and publishing the Services, to ensure compliance with this EULA, to protect the health or safety of anyone that we believe may be threatened, to protect our legal rights and remedies, to report a crime or offensive behavior, or to comply with applicable law. We may (but don’t have to) remove or disable access to any Content, at any time and without notice. We may (but don’t have to) investigate violations of this EULA or conduct that affects the Services.

9.              Virtual Goods and Game Currency
===============================================

We may offer you some cool features in our games for which you must pay. We need special permission to charge your payment method. These features are owned by us.

(a)            Purchasing or Obtaining Virtual Goods and Game Currency. Subject to applicable foreign exchange control regulations in your jurisdiction, we may offer certain upgrades and options within our Games that you can buy with real world currency, including, but not limited to, in-game currency where permitted under applicable law (“**Game Currency**”), character skins, mounts and vehicles, digital cards, experience boosts, gear, and other customizations for your in-Game characters, and other such digital add-on items that may improve your Game experience in some way (“**Virtual Goods**”). Except as otherwise communicated to you within the functionality of the Game, Game Currency and Virtual Goods are not transferable from one Game to another. You may also be able to obtain certain Virtual Goods and Game Currency without making a purchase, such as an in-Game award. When you purchase Game Currency, Virtual Goods, or a Game itself (each, a “**Transaction**”), your purchase will be made through the functionality available through the App Store or other platforms we make available to you. Prior to making a Transaction, you should make sure you fully understand the agreement that covers your Transaction, whether that agreement is an App Store Agreement or another payment platform agreement (like our WeGame Platform or a third-party payment processor’s terms). There may be limits to the quantity and number of times you can purchase Virtual Goods, Game Currency, or other aspects of your Transaction. For example, there may be a maximum amount of Game Currency you are able to hold (in-Game) or purchase at a given time, or a maximum number of Transactions you may make per day; these additional restrictions may be communicated to you via the functionality of the Services. We may, from time to time, modify, amend, or supplement our fees, billing methods, and terms applicable to Game Currency, Virtual Goods or to any purchases, and post those changes in this EULA, in separate terms and conditions or in other terms or agreements posted on the applicable website or as part of the Game or otherwise provided to you by us. Except where prohibited by law in your jurisdiction, such modifications, amendments, supplements, or terms shall be effective immediately upon posting and shall be incorporated by reference into this EULA. If any change is unacceptable to you, you may terminate the use of your Game Account at any time.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(b)            Your License to Virtual Goods and Game Currency. Virtual Goods and Game Currency are digital items, and your use of them is governed by this EULA and the App Store Agreement(s).  VIRTUAL GOODS AND GAME CURRENCY HAVE NO MONETARY VALUE AND CANNOT BE REDEEMED FOR CASH. VIRTUAL GOODS AND GAME CURRENCY ARE NON-TRANSFERABLE AND NON-TRADABLE, IN WHOLE OR PART, AND ARE NOT PROVIDED FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES. Virtual Goods and Game Currency are licensed, not sold. Provided you comply with the terms of this EULA and the App Store Agreement(s), we grant you the following license: a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable limited right and license to use any Virtual Goods or Game Currency you gain access to, whether purchased or otherwise obtained, solely in connection with your use of the Game in question and within the Game (unless we otherwise communicate to you that you may use them in multiple Games) and for no other purpose.  Unless expressly permitted by us in a specific Game, you may not trade any such Virtual Good or Game Currency with others. We may cancel, revoke, or otherwise prevent the use of Virtual Goods or Game Currency if we suspect any unauthorized or fraudulent activity, and/or to correct any erroneous application of any Virtual Goods or Game Currency to your Account.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(c)             Changes to Game Currency and Virtual Goods. Except as otherwise prohibited by applicable law, we, in our sole discretion, may modify, substitute, replace, suspend, cancel, or eliminate any Game Currency or Virtual Goods, including your ability to access or use Game Currency or Virtual Goods, without notice or liability to you, such as if we need to temporarily suspend the Game to make updates, have an emergency that requires us to disable our Services, or if we need to ultimately shut a Game down for economic or other reasons due to a limited number of users continuing to make use of the online Service over time. YOU AGREE THAT YOU WON’T ASSERT OR BRING ANY CLAIM AGAINST US, OUR AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OR LICENSORS (THE “**COMPANY PARTIES**”) RELATING TO (A) A CLAIM THAT YOU HAVE A PROPRIETARY INTEREST IN ANY GAME CURRENCY OR VIRTUAL GOODS; OR (B) A CLAIM FOR AN ALLEGED MONETARY VALUE OF GAME CURRENCY OR VIRTUAL GOODS LOST UPON (I) DELETION OR SUSPENSION OF YOUR ACCOUNT, (II) ADJUSTMENTS TO THE GAME THAT RESULT IN THE VALUE OF VIRTUAL GOODS OR GAME CURRENCY CHANGING, OR (III) MODIFICATION, TERMINATION, OR EXPIRATION OF THIS EULA.

10.           Refunds
=====================

Subject to applicable law (including as described in each country-specific addendum below), or App Store policy, (i) all Games, Virtual Goods and Game Currency remain our property, have no monetary value and are not redeemable, refundable, or eligible for any other alternate remedy for any “real world” money or anything of monetary value, unless they are defective, unavailable, or do not perform in accordance with the specifications we provide; (ii) we may revoke your license to such Games, Virtual Goods and/or Game Currency at any time consistent with this EULA without notice or liability to you; and (iii) except where the law in your jurisdiction provides a right of withdrawal that cannot be waived by contract, by purchasing and using any Games, Virtual Goods and/or Game Currency, you hereby waive your right to withdraw from your agreement to purchase the applicable Game, Virtual and/or Game Currency, and you agree that you will therefore not be eligible to receive a refund (or any alternative remedy) in relation to such Game, Virtual Good and/or Game Currency. Additionally, you hereby agree that any withdrawal right expires immediately upon purchase and delivery of your Game, Virtual Good and/or Game Currency, unless the law in your jurisdiction provides otherwise. This section does not affect your statutory rights.  

11.           Beta Testing
==========================

From time to time, we may offer a beta version of one of our Services (a “**Beta**”). As the name implies, Betas are not commercial launch versions, are not guaranteed to work properly, and may make other parts of your system not work properly as well. For the license granted to you in Section 6 above to extend to the Beta (meaning, for you to have permission to use the Beta), you acknowledge and agree to the following terms in addition to the rest of this EULA:

(a)            We may automatically delete or modify the information stored on your computer related to the Beta for any reason at any time during the duration of the Beta test;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(b)            We may terminate the Beta test at any time, which would then render your Beta unplayable or unable to function properly. When we terminate a Beta, you must delete the local Beta instance on your computer and all documents and materials you received from us in connection with the Beta;
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(c)             Use of a Beta is subject to confidential treatment of that Beta and all elements thereof. "Confidential Information" means any information disclosed by us to you, or accessed or provided by you, in relation to the Beta (including any feedback provided and the Game itself). You agree that you will:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### (i)              not use any Confidential Information other than as necessary to use the Beta in accordance with this EULA;

### (ii)            maintain Confidential Information in strict confidence and use the same degree of care to protect it as you use to protect your own confidential information, but in no circumstances less than reasonable care;

### (iii)           not disclose the Confidential Information to any person or entity other than as permitted by us; and

### (iv)           not make any public announcements related to Beta or the Service, including publishing or disclosing any information (e.g. screenshots and specifications) relating to the Beta, without our prior written approval, which we may grant or withhold in our sole discretion. 

(d)            Termination of a Beta by us is not grounds for any kind of refund and your participation in a Beta does not entitle you to any compensation or any free Services, including any Content and Game Currency; and
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If and when we release a full (non-Beta) version of the particular Game, we may allow your use of the Game to continue to the full version. If so allowed by us, your continued use of the Game will no longer be subject to this Section 11, but will still be subject to the rest of this EULA.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

12.           App Store; Console Games

This license does not lapse or expire even if we do not exercise our rights under this license within a period of one year. If you have rights in the Feedback that cannot be licensed to us under applicable law (such as moral and other personal rights), you hereby waive and agree not to assert those rights. You understand and agree that you are freely giving your Feedback, that we don’t have to use it, and that you will not be compensated in any way for your Feedback. You represent and warrant that you have rights in any Feedback that you provide to us sufficient to grant us and other affected parties the rights described above, including, without limitation, intellectual property rights or rights of publicity or privacy.

THESE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS REGARDING DAMAGES APPLY EVEN IF ANY REMEDY FAILS TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE COMPENSATION AND ARE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN YOU AND US.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, some countries, states, provinces, or other jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation of liability as stated above, so the above terms may not apply to you. Instead, in such jurisdictions, the foregoing exclusions and limitations will apply to the maximum extent permitted by the laws of such jurisdictions. Also, you may have additional legal rights in your jurisdiction, and nothing in this EULA will prejudice such rights that you may have as a consumer of the Services.

You agree to reimburse us for any payments made or loss suffered by us, whether in a court judgment or settlement, based on any matter covered by this Section 20.

21.           Termination

To the fullest extent consistent with applicable law, we may suspend, modify or terminate your access to and use of the Services, including any Game, Virtual Goods, and Content, with no liability or notice to you, in the event that (a) we cease providing the Game to similarly situated users generally; (b) you breach any terms of this EULA (including the App Store Agreement(s) and our other policies specified in this EULA); (c) the owner of the applicable App Store terminates your App Store Account; or (d) we otherwise deem it necessary to suspend or modify your access to and use of the Services or terminate this EULA in our sole discretion. You may also terminate this EULA by deleting and uninstalling the Game on all of your devices or by deleting your App Store Account.  A suspension or modification of your access to and use of the Services will result in your inability to access and use some or all features of the Services, as determined by us in our sole discretion. Upon any termination of this EULA, the rights granted to you will automatically terminate, you may no longer exercise any of those rights or this EULA.  Subject to applicable law, we may, in our sole discretion, provide continued access to and use of the Services after such termination.

Except to the extent required by law, all payments and fees are non-refundable under all circumstances, regardless of whether or not this EULA has been terminated.

The following sections will survive termination of this EULA: 8 (first two sentences only), 13, 19, 20, 22 through 25, and this sentence of Section 21.

22.           Dispute Resolution and Governing Law

You are agreeing to Laws of Singapore. If there is a dispute between us, we agree it’ll be resolved through arbitration, with each of us paying our own costs. 

(a)            Governing Law. You agree that any dispute, controversy, difference, or claim arising out of or relating to this EULA, a Game, or  the Services, including the existence, validity, interpretation, performance, breach or termination thereof or any dispute regarding non-contractual obligations arising out of or relating to this EULA, a Game, or the Services (collectively, “**Disputes**”) will be resolved in accordance with the laws of Singapore without reference to choice of law rules and not including the provisions of the 1980 U.N.

The Tribunal will consist of three (3) arbitrators, with each party nominating one arbitrator within thirty (30) days after the delivery of the arbitration notice. The appointment of such arbitrators will be confirmed by the SIAC, and both arbitrators will be instructed to and will agree on the third arbitrator within ten (10) days of their confirmation by the SIAC. Should either party fail to appoint an arbitrator, or should the two arbitrators fail within ten (10) days to reach agreement on the third arbitrator, such arbitrator(s) will be appointed by the Secretary General of the SIAC. The arbitrators will award only such damages as are permitted to be awarded pursuant to this EULA.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(e)            Injunctive Relief. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this EULA, either party may always apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for an injunction or any other legal or equitable relief.

**Schedule** **A-2: Addendum for residents of the United States**

**Dispute Resolution**: Section 22 of this EULA is replaced with its entirety with the following:

This section only applies if you are accessing, using, or have purchased the Services in the United States.

You are agreeing to the laws of California. Any court cases will be handled in the Northern District of California.

(a)            Governing Law and Forum Choice. This EULA and any action related thereto, including but not limited to any  dispute, controversy, difference, or claim arising out of or relating to this EULA, a Game, or the Services, including the existence, validity, interpretation, performance, breach or termination thereof or any dispute regarding non-contractual obligations arising out of or relating to this EULA, a Game, or the Services (collectively, “**Disputes**”) will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, federal arbitration law, and the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Section 22, the exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes (defined below) that you and we are not required to arbitrate will be the state and federal courts located in the Northern District of California, and you and we each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

US residents—if there is a dispute between us, we agree we’ll resolve it through arbitration (in your home area) instead of through the courts. You are also agreeing not to participate in a class-action lawsuit against us. (This section is long, so we’re providing mini-explanations for each part.)

(a)            Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes. We each agree that any Dispute will be resolved solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding. You and we agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this EULA, and that you and we are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision survives termination of this EULA.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(b)            Location of Arbitration.  If you are a resident of the United States, any arbitration will take place in your county of residence, to the exclusion of all other venues.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Disputes that qualify for small claims court or relate to the infringement of our intellectual property do not have to be arbitrated.

(c)             Exceptions. As limited exceptions to Section 22(b) above: (i) we may both seek to resolve a Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies; and (ii) we each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The American Arbitration Association’s Consumer Arbitration Rules will apply. Arbitration will be near where you live unless we agree otherwise.

(d)            Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“**AAA**”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “**AAA Rules**”) then in effect, except as modified by this EULA. The AAA Rules are available at [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/) or by calling 1-800-778-7879. A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to AAA and give notice to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules. The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) where you live, unless we both agree to a different location. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, and scope of this arbitration agreement.

Unless your claim is frivolous or for more than $10,000, we’ll pay the filing, administration, and arbitrator fees. We won’t seek attorney fees from you, but if you win you can seek them from us to the extent allowed by law.

(e)            Arbitration Costs. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. We’ll pay for all filing, administration and arbitrator fees and expenses if your Dispute is for less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous. If we prevail in arbitration, we’ll pay all of our attorneys’ fees and costs and won’t seek to recover them from you. If you prevail in arbitration, you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Except for Section 22(d), the arbitration may only award injunctive relief for the party seeking injunctive relief, and to the extent necessary to provide that relief. Any public injunctive relief sought must be litigated in a civil court.

(f)             Injunctive and Declaratory Relief. Except as provided in Section 22(d) above, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by either party and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. To the extent that you or we prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. You and we agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You agree not to participate in a class action and only bring claims as an individual. Your dispute can’t be combined with other people’s claims.

(g)            Class Action Waiver.  **YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.**  Further, if the parties’ dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person's claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution (Section 22) shall be null and void.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If a court decides a part of this section is unenforceable, the rest still applies.

### Severability.  With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 22(h) above, if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of this EULA is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this EULA will still apply.
