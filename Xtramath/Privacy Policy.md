This policy and our Terms of Service areknown collectively as our “Terms.” We may change these Terms from time to time, but willprovide notice as specified in the Terms of Service document.



This policy is effective May 25, 2018, and replaces our prior privacy policy.



Summary



● We collect the minimum amount of data required to operate ourprogram.● We use parents’ and teachers’ Personal Data to operate our program and, with theirpermission, to contact them about the program.● We use students’ Personal Data only to operate our program.● We use de-identified student data to improve our program.● We protect student data and have signed the Student Privacy Pledge.● We do not advertise to students, sell their data, or profile them in any way.● We comply with applicable data privacy laws, such as FERPA, COPPA, and GDPR.● We never sell user data to third parties.



What Data We Collect



XtraMath collects the minimum amount of data required to operate our program. Below wesummarize the data we collect on students, teachers, and parents. For an up-to-date list thatshows what user data we collect, and how we use that data, see Appendix B, Record of DataProcessing.



Definitions



● Data includes all information connected with a person’s or educational entity’s use ofXtraMath. This includes, but is not limited to, Personal Data, metadata, usage andperformance data.● Personal Data includes any data that can directly or indirectly identify an individualperson. For example: an email address is always considered Personal Data; a student’sgrade level generally is not, but could be in conjunction with other information.

● School includes: individual schools; teachers acting on behalf of schools; schooldistricts; and other local educational entities.



Student Data



We collect a student’s first name, grade level, and program settings from the student’s parent orteacher. As the student uses XtraMath, we collect usage and performance data, such as whenthey signed in, how many questions they answered correctly, and how long it took them toanswer questions. If a student signs in via a single sign-on provider, such as Google, we collectan identifier from the provider that allows us to authenticate their sign-in. We do not collect thestudent email address that may be used for such a sign-in.

Other personal information about the student could be inferred from data that we collect. If astudent account belongs to a class, for example, then we could infer that they attend a certainschool.



Parent Data



We collect a parent’s name and email address when they sign up for an account. If they sign upusing a single sign-on provider, we also collect an identifier that allows us to authenticate theirsign-in. We also collect some metadata and account settings, such as their time zone, thelanguage they used to sign up, and their email preferences.

A parent supplies a password when they create an account. The password is hashed(scrambled) on the user’s computer before it is ever sent to XtraMath. We do not have access toa user’s original password, and cannot obtain it from the hashed version that we receive.

Other personal information about the parent could be inferred from data that we collect. Forexample, we could infer that a parent whose account is linked to a student account is the parentor guardian of that student.



Teacher Data



We collect the same data for teacher accounts as parent accounts, with a few additions. Forexample, we collect the name by which students address the teacher, such as “Ms. Smith.” Wealso collect information about each class that the teacher creates, such as its name and its enddate.

Other personal information about the teacher could be inferred from data we collect. Forexample, we could infer that the teacher works at a specific school based on their emailaddress.

We will not release de-identified data unless we are confident itcannot be re-identified, due to the removal of all direct and indirect personal identifiers, and theeducational researchers have agreed in writing that they will not attempt to re-identify anyindividuals, classes, or Schools.

We may use aggregate de-identified data, such as the number of users of our service, forpromotional purposes.

Nevertheless, we fully comply with the law as if we were subject to it.Children under the age of 13 may not create accounts. We only collect usage and performancedata from students as a result of their performing educational activities, and we only use thatdata for educational purposes. If we gain actual knowledge that a child is using XtraMathwithout the appropriate consent, we terminate the account.

When a School provides us with astudent’s Personal Data (or PII — Personally Identifiable Information) under the FERPA schoolofficial exemption, they remain in control of that data. XtraMath will only use and disclose thatdata as specified in our Terms and as allowed by law.

Cookies and Local Storage



XtraMath intends to discontinue the use of cookies by August 1, 2018.



XtraMath uses two types of cookies. These cookies can be cleared via browser settings —aboutcookies.org provides cookie management instructions for many specific browsers.

● Google Analytics cookies allow us to see data such as the number of site visitors weget, and which pages they visit the most.● Vimeo cookies are stored when users play the videos on our homepage, and primarilykeep track of the video player settings.

The XtraMath website uses “LocalStorage” files to remember a user’s sign-in information (if theychoose to do so). We also use “SessionStorage” to improve performance during studentactivities by temporarily storing activity data on the device. Use of LocalStorage andSessionStorage is not required to use XtraMath. Users can remove remembered sign-ininformation at any time via the appropriate sign-in page. Users can also clear all LocalStorageby using the “Clear now” button on our support page, or via browser settings.

The XtraMath mobile apps use application data for the same purposes as browser LocalStorageand SessionStorage. Users can still remove remembered sign-in information via the app’ssign-in pages. Uninstalling the app will remove all locally stored data. Some devices also allowusers to clear locally stored app data without uninstalling the app.
