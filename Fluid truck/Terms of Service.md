#### 1\. About

Fluid is an online platform or marketplace that allows Users to advertise, offer and rent just about anything in a variety of pricing formats and locations. Fluid does not own or manage any property listed through the Services. Fluid is not a party to any rental or other agreement between Users. The actual contract is between the borrower and lender. Unless otherwise provided, Fluid's responsibilities are limited to enabling the Services and serving as a limited agent (and limited power of attorney for insurance purposes) for Users listing items available for renting ("Rental") for the purpose of accepting payments from Users borrowing the Lender's items ("Borrower").  
  
While Fluid may provide pricing, rental, delivery, shipping, listing and other guidance in our Services, such guidance is solely for information purposes only and you may decide to follow it or not. Also, while we may help facilitate the resolution of disputes through our Services, Fluid has no control over and does not guarantee the existence, quality, safety or legality of items advertised and offered; the truth or accuracy of User's content or listings; the ability of Users to rent items; the ability of Users to pay for items; the ability of Users to use an item; the existence of User insurance coverage; or that a User will actually complete a rental or transaction or return an item.

In addition, if Fluid becomes aware of or receives a complaint (or multiple complaints) from any User or third party regarding a User's listing, Borrower's action or rental practices that, in our sole discretion, warrants the immediate removal of such User's listing or item from the Services, then we may immediately terminate such Borrower's listing or User's account without notice to the User and without refund.

#### 4\. Borrowers

1. Rental Agreement. We ask that you return an item just like OR BETTER than you received it. Fluid is a community and we hope that you will engage in a Transaction with respect for your fellow Users. If you confirm a Transaction, you are responsible for completing all of the requirements necessary for the Transaction, including payment. By confirming a Transaction, you agree that you have:
    
    * Read the full item listing before confirming a Transaction;  
        
    * You understand you are entering into a legally binding contract to rent an item when you confirm a Transaction.
    * Fluid is not a part of the rental between the Lender and the Borrower. Fluid is a marketplace, online intermediary and sharing platform only.
    * You are authorizing Fluid to charge your Card, as defined below, for any Transaction fees and the Fluid Fee.
2. Returning an Item. There is a thirty (30) minute grace period associated with all Transactions. If you as a Borrower keep an item past the agreed upon return time without the Lender's consent and you have exceeded the thirty (30) minute grace period (the grace period is timed by and controlled in the discretion of the Lender), you agree that Fluid, in its sole role as limited collection agent for Lender, may charge your Card to collect the hourly set forth for the applicable to the Transaction.

#### 5\. Security Deposit

Lenders may choose to include security deposits in their listing ("Security Deposit"). Each listing will specify if a Security Deposit is required. Any disputes must be handled directly between the Borrower and the Lender. Lenders can use the Security Deposit to pay any amounts owed for a reservation under these Terms. Fluid will use its reasonable efforts to assist in a dispute between a Lender and Borrower related to a Security Deposit but Fluid is not responsible for administering or accepting any claims by Users related to Security Deposits and disclaims any and all liability in this regard. In some instances, a Security Deposit may be a pre-authorization for a specified amount on you Card, as defined below.  

#### 6\. Ranking System

Users may post reviews, comments, photos, videos, and other content; send e-cards and other communications; and submit suggestions, ideas, comments, questions, or other information, so long as the content is not illegal, obscene, threatening, defamatory, invasive of privacy, infringing of intellectual property rights (including publicity rights), or otherwise injurious to third parties or objectionable, and does not consist of or contain software viruses, political campaigning, commercial solicitation, chain letters, mass mailings, or any form of "spam" or unsolicited commercial electronic messages. You may not use a false e-mail address, impersonate any person or entity, or otherwise mislead as to the origin of a card or other content. Fluid reserves the right (but not the obligation) to remove or edit such content, but does not regularly review posted content.  

#### 7\. Insurance

1. Unless otherwise provided in these Terms, Fluid does not provide liability insurance protection for Users. In the event that Fluid elects to provide insurance coverage for an Item, both Borrower and Lender must participate in and complete the Fluid claims process. Fluid must be notified of all claims within 72 hours of occurrence. Fluid reserves the right to deny any claims that are not timed within the 72 hour claim period. In addition, Fluid reserves the right to disallow coverage for any claims filed if the Users fail to provide Fluid with any information necessary or required to process any claim. In the event that Fluid does not affirmatively state in writing that it is providing coverage for a reservation, Users are solely responsible for obtaining insurance coverage sufficient to protect their items. In some instances, Users have the right to deny Fluid insurance coverage. In the event that Fluid denies coverage, does not provide coverage or User declines coverage, Users agree that they have or will obtain the appropriate insurance coverage sufficient to cover the items they list or borrow through the Services and will maintain adequate insurance coverage through the return of the item to the owner. Further, Users agree to provide us with copies of relevant proof of insurance upon request.  
    
2. Fluid does not provide insurance coverage for mechanical damage to items.

#### 8\. Vehicles. All Users must be 21 years of age and satisfy Fluid's safe driver guidelines to rent a vehicle on Fluid. The following uses of the vehicle are prohibited and constitute breach of these Terms.

    * By anyone who obtained the vehicle or extended the reservation period by giving Fluid false, fraudulent or misleading information;

    * In a manner that causes damage to the vehicle due to inadequately secured cargo.
    * After an accident with the vehicle unless and until you summon the police to the accident scene.
2. In the event that a User violates these Terms, such User shall be responsible for all damage and claims that result from the prohibited conduct and insurance coverage is void if you violate these Terms.
3. Lender's must ensure (and represent and warrant to Fluid and the Borrower) that all vehicles listed through the Services are safe and mechanically sound. Additionally, all vehicles must be properly registered, insured and maintained in accordance with all applicable state laws and requirements, must maintain the state required minimum insurance coverage on any motorized vehicle that is listed and rented on Fluid.
4. Lenders (and Fluid) may assess additional fees to Users to cover additional fees associated with the vehicle or reservation. These fees include: fuel and refueling charges, applicable sales, use and other taxes, all traffic, parking, tolls, cleaning fees, penalties, impound fees, forfeitures, penalties, court costs, towing, impoundment, smoking remediation fees, storage charges, and other expenses involving the vehicle incurred by Fluid or the Lender. Both the Lender and Fluid reserve the right to repossess the vehicle at any time. Borrowers agree to reimburse the Lender for any expenses incurred in locating and recovering the vehicle if a Borrower fails to return it or if the Lender elects to repossess the vehicle under these Terms. In the event that a vehicle is repossessed, Fluid and/or the Lender have the right to destroy, discard or dispose of any property left in the vehicle and Borrower waives any right or claims it may have with respect to such property.
5. Lenders may install a GPS tracking device on all vehicles and the Borrower waives any claims they may have against Fluid and the Lender as a result of the usage of such device.

#### 9\. Fees and Payments

1. Fluid's Fees. Fluid will charge a sharing fee ("Fluid Fee") payable by Borrowers who book an item through the Services. The Fluid Fee is deducted from the Transaction Fees from the item before remitting the balance to the Lender. The Fluid Fee covers the use of the Services and platform, insurance costs and credit card processing and is calculated as a percentage of the total Transaction amount. The current percentage used is 20%. Taxes may be charged in addition to the Fluid fee, if applicable. The Fluid Fee is charged when you confirm your Transaction and is nonrefundable. Even if you cancel your Transaction, you will not receive a refund for the Fluid Fee.
    
2. Payments. Lenders hereby appoint Fluid as their limited payment collection agency solely for the purpose of accepting payment for the Transaction. Fluid is not a party to the agreement between any Users. At the time you book a listing or item, you agree that Fluid may pre-authorize your credit card(s) ("Card") on file for any booking requested. When you return your item to the Lender, Fluid will charge you for the Transaction. Users authorize Fluid to store your preferred Card number and relevant information and charge your Card for your Transactions. If your Card expires or the account number is changed, please update your account immediately. Lender is solely responsible for any taxes that may be due as a result of such payment or Transaction. All Transactions that are processed Monday-Sunday of each week are sent to Users the following Tuesday via bank transfer.  
    
3. Facilitation of Payments. All payments are facilitated through a third-party payment processing service (e.g. Stripe, Inc. "Stripe") and additional terms may apply. Fluid may replace its third party payment processing services without notice to Users. Charges shall only be made through the Services. Cash payments are strictly prohibited. By agreeing to Fluids Terms, you also agree to be bound by Stripe's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, which can be found at: www.stripe.com/us/terms and www.stripe.com/us/privacy. Any breach of Stripe's Terms of Service will be treated as a breach of these Terms. You expressly understand that Fluid shall not be liable for any payments and monetary transactions that occur through your use of the Service and that all monetary transactions are handled by Stripe.
4. Fluid Fees and Charges: In the event that Borrower damages a vehicle, fails to comply with the terms of the rental, breaches these Terms or is assessed fees by a Lender, Borrower agrees to pay Fluid immediately for any such losses. If Borrower has a credit card on file, Borrower authorizes Fluid to charge the card on file for any such charges related to these Terms. This includes, but is not limited to, deductibles for insurance, damage fees, lender imposed fees, extensions, etc. Borrower agrees that it shall not dispute any such charges. In the event that Borrower fails to remit payment, provides a card that is declined such that Fluid cannot collect any fees or charges that are due, Fluid may impose a collections fee which may include recovery of all collection and attorneys' fees related to such efforts.
5. Risk Authorizations. To protect Users and Fluid from risk, Fluid may recommend that some Borrowers allow an additional hold or pre-authorization on their Card. Fluid will notify the Borrower if an additional hold is required as part of a Transaction.

#### 10\. Refunds; Cancellations

1. Refund. If you are a Borrower and encounter a Material Issue with an item, as defined below, Fluid may take the following actions, as determined by Fluid in its sole discretion. All determinations with respect to refunds shall be final and binding on the applicable Lender and Borrower.
    
    * Reimburse you up to the amount paid by you through the Services;  
        
    * Find and book you an alternative item for the remaining duration of your Transaction; or
    * Or find another remedy in the reasonable discretion of Fluid.
2. Material Issue. "Material Issue" may mean:
    
    * The Lender:  
        
    
    1. Cancels a Transaction shortly before the scheduled start of the Transaction;
    2. Fails to provide the Borrower with the reasonable ability to use the item; or
    3. Fails to describe the item accurately or misrepresents material facts about the item.
3. Cancellations.
    
    * Borrower. Borrowers have the right to cancel a Transaction for the first thirty (30) minutes after confirming a Transaction. In this instance, Borrower will not be charged for the Transaction. If, however, Borrower cancels the Transaction after the thirty (30) minute window, there are no cancellations or refunds unless otherwise provided in the vehicle listing.  Borrowers will be charged the full amount of the confirmed Transaction. The Fluid Fee and Booking Fee are also non-refundable if the cancellation occurs after the thirty (30) minute window.  
        
    * Lender. Lenders may cancel confirmed Transactions made through the Services prior to the start of the Transaction. In such instances, Fluid will charge the Lender a fifteen percent (15%) cancellation fee.  Depending on the circumstances and at Fluid's discretion, the Fluid Fee and Booking Fee may be charged to the Lender as part of this cancellation.  In the event that a Lender needs to cancel a Transaction after a Transaction has started, Fluid will work to facilitate the cancellation and may assess fees or issue refunds, in its sole discretion.

#### 11\. General Terms

1. Dispute Resolution. Please read this section carefully. It affects your rights and will have substantial impact on how claims you and Fluid have against each other are resolved. You and Fluid agree that any claim or dispute at law or at equity that has arisen or may arise between us relating in any way to or arising out of this or other agreements with Fluid, your use of or access to the Service, or any products or services sold, purchased or rented through the Services, will be resolve din accordance with the provisions set forth in this Dispute Resolution Section.
    
    * Arbitration. You and Fluid each agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and Fluid relating in any way to or arising out of this or previous versions of these Terms, your use of or access to the Services, or any products or services offered, listed, rented or advertised through the Services shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these Terms to arbitrate. The arbitration shall be conducted by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its rules and procedures, including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules (as applicable), as modified by these Terms. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org. YOU AND FLUID AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND FLUID AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S OR PARTY'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PRECEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER USERS. IF A COURT DECIDES THAT APPLICABLE LAW PRECLUDES ENFORCEMENT OF ANY OF THIS PARAGRAPH'S LIMITATIONS AS TO A PARTICULAR CLAIM FOR RELIEF, THEN THAT CLAIM (AND ONLY THAT CLAIM) MUST BE SEVERED FROM THE ARBITRATION AND MAY BE BROUGHT IN COURT, SUBJECT TO YOUR AND FLUID'S RIGHT TO APPEAL THE COURT'S DECISION. ALL OTHER CLAIMS WILL BE ARBITRATED. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, unless otherwise stated in these Terms. In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse Fluid for all fees associated with the arbitration. The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA rules. The arbitrator's decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator's award damages must be consistent with the terms of the "Limitation of Liability" section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant's individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law.
    * Choice of Law. You agree that, except to the extent inconsistent with or preempted by federal law, the laws of the State of Colorado, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Terms and the Service including any claim or dispute that has arisen between you and Fluid, except as otherwise stated in these Terms. In the event that the arbitration provision above is found not to apply to your particular claim or dispute, you agree that any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and Fluid must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in Denver, Colorado.
2. Content and Copyright.
    
    * Fluid respects copyright law and expects its Users to do the same. If we suspect or believe that Users infringe the rights of copyright holders, Fluid may terminate your account.
    * Fluid reserves the right to refuse to post any content, including hyperlinks.
