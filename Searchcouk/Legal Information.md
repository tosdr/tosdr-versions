    **Top 100 Law Firm**  
    **Senior Associate**  
    **Employment Law**  
    **London**  
      
    This top 100, full-service law firm has provided legal services and advice for businesses and individuals for more than 40 years. With three offices across the UK they are able to help clients across the country and overseas. Their clients range from private individuals, through to SME's and major national and international companies.  
    The Employment department have a team of lawyers to advise on a wide range of employment matters, with particular specialism in the recruitment and hospitality sectors. The team have a growing volume of litigation work, particularly whistleblowing claims, as well as impressive expertise in matters pertaining to regulatory compliance, business restricting and reorganisations, and pensions.  
      
    The firm's London office is seeking an ambitious, talented and motivated Senior Associate to join its rapidly growing and dynamic London Employment team. This is an exciting opportunity for the successful candidate to work closely with two well regarded partners, two solicitors and a trainee. The team is standalone, but works closely with Corporate, Restructuring & Insolvency, Intellectual Property and Corporate Immigration.  
      
    The candidate will be able to take on work from the partners in the team and run with that case load independently as well as ideally be interested in developing their own client base. The candidate will also be able to delegate work to the two junior lawyers in the team and supervise their work as appropriate.  
    The ideal candidate will have:
    
    * 5 + PQE.
    * Full spectrum of employment law experience including: dealing with unfair dismissal claims, discrimination claims, whistle-blowing claims, TUPE; Employment Tribunal and High Court litigation (including in insolvency situations); redundancy; general advisory; and advising on senior executive exits (desired but not essential).
    * Ability to manage own case-load.
    * Strong interest in business development, including presenting at conferences and seminars.
    * Assisting the partners in the team as well as delegating work to and supervising junior members of the team effectively.
    * Passion for developing the careers and skill set of junior lawyers.
    
    Please apply as directed or confidentially contact Aidan McAvinue at Search Legal for more information. Alternatively, if this role is not for you, I am working a variety of other Employment Law opportunities with ranked teams in the City London so would be interested to talk to any Employment lawyer.

    My client is seeking to recruit an experienced residential property lawyer to lead a friendly team of 4 in Mid Sussex.
    
    The firm prides itself on its forward thinking and friendly atmosphere, this firm is a place where their staff love to work, retention is high and have a loyal and varied client base.
    
    The residential property team comprises of 4 lawyers and 4 support staff. The quality of work is second-to-none and this will predominantly come from their well-established relationships with local agents and agents from further afield. A Senior Partner is now looking to take a step down and enjoy retirement, therefore, candidates are sought with the ability to manage their own busy caseload from start to finish with no supervision.
    
    The department often receive instructions on matters involving HNW transactions, agricultural/ equestrian elements and heritage properties. Experience in these fields would be desirable but not essential. The firm is open to receiving applications from qualified fee earners and ambitious lawyers who are keen to immerse themselves in the management of the department including the CQS registration. If the latter this will be reflected in the job title and the package with options such as HoD, Salaried or Equity Partner.
    
    If you would like to find out more about this outstanding opportunity please do not hesitate to get in touch
