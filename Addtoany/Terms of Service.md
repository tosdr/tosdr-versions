### Limitations of Liability

Under no circumstances shall AddToAny be liable for direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages (even if AddToAny has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from any aspect of your use of the AddToAny site or the service, whether the damages arise from use or misuse of the AddToAny site or the service, from inability to use the AddToAny site or the service, or the interruption, suspension, modification, alteration, or termination of the AddToAny site or the service.

### General Information

The TOS constitute the entire agreement between you and AddToAny and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements between you and AddToAny.

The failure of AddToAny to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the TOS shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
