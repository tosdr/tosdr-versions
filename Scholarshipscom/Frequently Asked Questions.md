### About Scholarships.com

![](/img/down.gif)What is Scholarships.com?

Scholarships.com is a leading free [scholarship search](https://www.scholarships.com/scholarship-search "Scholarship Search") resource that helps students pay and prepare for college. We have been around for over two decades and are among the most widely-used and trusted free college scholarship search and financial aid information resources on the Internet. Learn more [about us](https://www.scholarships.com/about-us "About Us").

In addition to offering more than 3.7 million scholarships, trending scholarship opportunities, and expert advice on college financial aid, we also help interested students interact with and be recruited by prospective colleges.

![](/img/down.gif)Is Scholarships.com free?

Absolutely. Scholarships.com offers a free scholarship and college search, timely college news, and financial aid information on every device you can think of. Scholarships.com is free and always will be.

![](/img/down.gif)How is Scholarships.com different than other scholarship sites?

The Scholarships.com proprietary database contains legitimate scholarships submitted by the scholarship providers themselves. A dedicated team vets, reviews, updates and adds scholarships to our database on a daily basis. If a scholarship is discontinued, we make sure to remove it from our database. Many sites rent an outdated list of scholarships with little information or offer scholarships that are highly promotional in nature. Also unlike some sites out there, we do not charge students to conduct a scholarship search or for any of our other services.

### Scholarship Basics

![](/img/down.gif)Are Scholarships.com scholarships legit?

Absolutely. Scholarships.com's expert staff reviews and approves each scholarship offer submitted to our database. Each scholarship is investigated and we never allow a scholarship to be listed in our database unless we are confident the award is legitimate. Under no circumstance do we accept scholarships that require you to pay an application fee or any sort of fee to apply.

![](/img/down.gif)Do I have to register to view scholarships in the Scholarships.com database?

Yes. It is the only way we will be able to deliver the most relevant scholarship opportunities in your direction and rule out scholarships that you don’t qualify for. Registering allows you to store your search results and favorite the scholarships you wish to pursue on a return visit.

![](/img/down.gif)What if I have a question regarding a scholarship?

If you have questions about a scholarship and can’t find the answer in the eligibility requirements, terms and conditions or general guidelines, your best resource will be the scholarship provider. You can contact them with the contact information we provide or by visiting their website.

![](/img/down.gif)How do I apply for scholarships?

You can easily apply to scholarships from your scholarship matches page. For more information or to apply for a scholarship for which you are interested, click the Apply Now button on the scholarship page. You’ll be directed to the scholarship provider’s website, where you can then find out exactly how and where to apply.

![](/img/down.gif)How do I get more scholarship matches?

To maximize your scholarship opportunities and increase your potential earning value, we encourage you to fill out your profile from beginning to end, adding all of your personal interests and information. The more information you provide us, the more scholarships we can send your way.

![](/img/down.gif)Can I apply for scholarships if I am not currently enrolled in college / have not decided on a school?

You don’t have to be officially enrolled in a college or university to begin your search for scholarships. If you haven’t decided which school you’d like to attend, you can select schools in which you are interested while completing your profile. If you receive a scholarship, the sponsor may ask for eligibility verification. This may include, among other things, proof of college enrollment. Be sure to read the eligibility requirements for each scholarship before applying.

![](/img/down.gif)Does Scholarships.com offer scholarships for graduate students?

Yes. We understand that grad students require financial assistance to continue their education. That’s why we offer a long list of scholarships exclusively for grad students. To see what graduate student scholarships you qualify for, [conduct a free scholarship search](https://www.scholarships.com/scholarship-search).

![](/img/down.gif)I am not a traditional student. Can I still win a scholarship?

Of course. Whether you took a gap year, took a break from school to work or have a family, are a single parent, or are pursuing a trade, there are plenty of scholarships exclusive to non-traditional students. If you’ve been out of school for a while, you may have to fill out certain fields to the best of your ability or make approximated guesses – this may include academic information such as test scores, GPA, and so on.

![](/img/down.gif)Does Scholarships.com offer scholarships for international students?

Scholarships.com offers a free college scholarship search for students who are currently living in and studying in the United States. In order to complete your Scholarships.com profile, you will need to submit a U.S. residential address, as well as select at least one college or university located in the U.S.
