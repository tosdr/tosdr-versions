Privacy Policy
==============

 ![Padlock on laptop computer keyboard](/img/padlock-laptop-computer.webp "Privacy Policy")

[![Click to verify BBB accreditation and to see a BBB report.](/img/bbbseal1.gif "Click to verify BBB accreditation and to see a BBB report.")](javascript:openWindow('http://www.bbb.org/chicago/business-reviews/scholarships-and-financial-aid/scholarshipscom-in-highland-park-il-53000345');)

This Privacy Policy applies to [www.scholarships.com](http://www.scholarships.com/). This Privacy Policy describes how Scholarships.com collects and uses the personal information you provide. It also describes the choices available to you regarding the use of, your access to, and how to update and correct your personal information.

Scholarships.com recognizes that your privacy is important. To demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy and to explain the types of information we obtain about visitors to our website, how that information is obtained and used, and how visitors can restrict its use or disclosure, we have created the Privacy Policy below. The following discusses our information gathering and dissemination practices at Scholarships.com.

Information We Receive and How It Is Used
-----------------------------------------

All personal information obtained by Scholarships.com about individual visitors to our website is information supplied voluntarily by that visitor. During registration, users are required to provide certain categories of information, such as name, address, email address, phone number, a password, date of birth, gender, and country of citizenship. In addition, users may choose to provide other categories of information, such as career objectives, health or disability information, hobbies, and other interests. Scholarships.com encourages users to provide all fields of information to maximize the effectiveness of the scholarship and college search. We ask for permission when sharing information with marketing partners, which are reputable companies and organizations that provide products and services of interest to students and parents. Users may choose whether to opt-in or opt-out of sharing information with our marketing partners.

When Scholarships.com shares personal information with a third party, the information will become permanently subject to the information use and sharing practices of the third party. The third party will not be restricted by our Privacy Policy, with respect to its use and further sharing of your personal information. If you agree to receive communications from our marketing partners and later change your mind, you will need to contact those companies directly. Any information updates you wish to make must be forwarded to the company at that point in time.

Upon request Scholarships.com will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. Users may change personal profile information at Scholarships.com at any time by logging in to the website and entering the email address and password associated with their profile. After users have logged in, they will be directed to their Scholarship Matches. In the tabbed navigation at the top of the page, users will find a link to "Profile". By clicking on that tab, users will be directed to a summary of their information, divided into sections. An "Edit This Section" option in the upper-right corner of each section allows users to modify and update their information. Users can also [contact us here](https://www.scholarships.com/about-us/contact-us/privacy-policy) in order to request access to submitted information. To protect the security and integrity of our users’ information, we will take necessary steps in verifying all new profile identities before providing access. It is the responsibility of the user to make all necessary changes in their profile and make sure their profiles are up-to-date.

Users of Scholarships.com who wish to terminate their membership, or otherwise request to cease usage of their information at Scholarships.com may do so at any time by contacting us via our contact form by [clicking here](https://www.scholarships.com/about-us/contact-us/account-updates-and-questions "Website Content"). Please be sure to type "Remove" in the subject field and submit the email account associated with the membership you would like terminated. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe. Information will be retained for as long as the account is active or requests our services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

Scholarships.com is committed to safeguarding users' privacy on our website. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once it is received. We require our employees to protect our users and visitors by keeping their profile information private, and expect our marketing partners to follow suit. Rest assured that your user profile will be protected when you visit Scholarships.com. There are security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of all user information under our control.

Regardless of whether you wish to share your personal information, we reserve the right to share aggregated demographic data and related information with our business partners. Such aggregate information will not contain any personal information that can identify any individual user.

Information Sharing & Email Preferences
---------------------------------------

Scholarships.com understands the importance of protecting personally-identifiable information. We will not share, sell, rent or otherwise transfer any information without the user's permission, and then, only in accordance with the terms set forth in this Privacy Policy. Our website provides users the opportunity to unsubscribe/opt-out from receiving email messages from Scholarships.com and its marketing partners, or from having their personal information shared with our marketing partners. Users may change their email preferences by following the unsubscribe instructions contained in each of the email messages they receive or by [clicking here](https://www.scholarships.com/about-us/privacy-policy/unsubscribe "Unsubscribe"). Please allow up to seven business days for these changes to take effect. If you no longer wish to be a registered user of Scholarships.com, you may have your profile removed by [clicking here](https://www.scholarships.com/about-us/contact-us/account-and-notification-settings "Email Unsubscribe").

Scholarships.com may periodically use contact information in order to send emails regarding updates at the Scholarships.com site, such as scholarship opportunities and additional listings. The frequency of these messages will vary depending on the user's preference, including the types of scholarships and other activities in which a user has indicated an interest. If you specifically provide Scholarships.com with permission at the time of registration, you may also receive commercial emails. Please note that email messages from third parties are not governed by the opt-out provisions of this Privacy Policy.

In certain situations, Scholarships.com may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities. We may also disclose your personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process. When we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.

We may provide your personal information to company provider services that help us with business-related activity; such as shipping your order or offering customer service. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only on a service-needs basis.
