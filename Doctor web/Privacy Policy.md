        * e) Your gender and education are provided by You when filling out the user profile form on the Rights Holder's website, optionally, on a voluntary basis (the ability to use the Services does not depend on You providing this data), and the Rights Holder needs this information solely to research and form a generalised user profile in order to improve the Services, and to advertise and promote the Services among potential users and other customers.
        
    4. 5.4. The Rights Holder, within its competence, takes the technical and organisational measures necessary and sufficient to ensure that Your personal data will not be made available to third parties without Your consent and will not be deleted accidentally or as the result of illegal actions.
