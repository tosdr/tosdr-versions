Backups are only accessed in order to restore services, find errors, or provide data for reasonable and valid in law demands by public offices and courts of justice. We will never use backups for any form of marketing analysis, or in order to restore data you wanted to be deleted.

If data is provided to courts of justice and public offices, this is only done in accordance with our Data Protection Officer. If we are not prohibited by law, we will always try to contact you to inform you about such data release.

**Database backups** of the portal are kept for 10 years.

Cookies and external services
-----------------------------

**Information regarding the EU directive 2009/136/EC**  
This online tool uses Cookies, [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/gdpr/introduction/) and [hCaptcha](https://www.hcaptcha.com/privacy) to provide the best possible functionality, to improve the service and to protect the portal from attacks.

  

When you visit our portal you will receive some cookies necessary for the provision of the portal's services

  

**XSRF-TOKEN:** This cookie helps us to battle [Cross-Site-Request-Forgery (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) .

  

**laravel\_token:** This cookie is also used to battle [Cross-Site-Request-Forgery (Technical reference)](https://laravel.com/docs/master/csrf) .

  

**_portal\_name_\_session:** This is a secure and encrypted cookie storing all volatile data of your session.

  

**remember\_web\__random\_string_:** This cookie is set if you check the "Remember login" button during login.

  

**browser\_authentication:** This cookie is set to reduce the amount of CAPTCHA-challenges in the current browser.

  

### If necessary

**Cloudflare:** In order to defend servers against [DDoS attacks](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/) selected services and services under attack use [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/gdpr/introduction/), if the sensitivity of the processed data allows this measure.

  

**Several cookies for hcaptcha.com:** These cookies are set by hCaptcha at the latest if the login form is shown. hCaptcha are the picture challenges you have to solve before being able to login. This prevents attackers from accessing your account just by testing random password until one matches. [hCaptcha data security notice](https://www.hcaptcha.com/privacy)

  

**Several cookies for vimeo.com:** These cookies are set when a Vimeo video or preview is loaded on the page. [Vimeo's Cookie Policy](https://vimeo.com/cookie_policy)

  

**Several cookies for youtube.com:** These cookies are set when a YouTube video or preview is loaded on the page. [YouTube data security notice](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en)

  

**\_\_stripe\_mid:** Fraud prevention by the payment provider Stripe. [Stripe's Cookie Policy](https://stripe.com/cookie-settings)

  

**Matomo:** On pages which use our [Matomo](https://matomo.org/privacy/) analysis:

* \_pk\_ref
* \_pk\_cvar
* \_pk\_id
* \_pk\_ses
* \_pk\_hsr
* matomo\_sessid
* mtm\_consent, mtm\_consent\_removed and mtm\_cookie\_consent
* matomo\_ignore, when you exclude yourself from being tracked (opt-out)

These are used to store your tracking preferences and if you allow us to analyse your visits, pseudonyms to recognise your browser. Please visit [Matomo](https://matomo.org/faq/general/faq_146/) for up-to-date information.

  

### Tips for privacy aware browsing

In order to block so-called tracking-cookies we suggest that you use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/app), both the app, as well as the browser extention.

  

As alternative, or in addition, we can recommend the browser extension [Privacy Badger](https://privacybadger.org/), which also sends [Do Not Track](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track) signals to each website, if requested (see below).

  

### Do Not Track (DNT) policy

[dnt-policy.txt](https://neurohr.bytes.software/.well-known/dnt-policy.txt)

Our software respects [Do Not Track](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_Not_Track) signals sent by your browser and takes care that external services are only connected with explicit permission. This can lead to limited functionality and additional user interactions: Videos don't autoplay, payment providers are not available, registration is not possible, if an external CAPTCHA-service is required as additional security, etc.  
Permission is given per service, i.e. if you allow one video to play then all videos from that external provider are allowed to play in your current session.
