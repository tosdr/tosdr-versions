> 
> **4\.

> 
> **5\.

Net terms are also available for eligible customers, and may be paid by check. We also accept wire transfer by request.

> 
> **6\. Leasing.** We now offer leasing options for purchasing your new product. Qualified customers will have the ability to lease their purchase with convenient and powerful financing options. You are provided with the flexibility, quick response, and simplicity you need with quality customer service during your financing term.
> 
> **Why Should I consider Leasing? Advantages of Leasing:**
> 
> * **Leasing provides total financing.** Generally no down payments are required, and lessees pay no extraneous tax, delivery, warranty, or other miscellaneous costs. All costs associated with a purchase can be included in the lease, including delivery and installation.
> * **Leasing conserves working capital.** Leasing leaves lines of credit at other financial institutions free for cash-flow purposes, investments, unsecured loans, or unexpected emergencies.
> * **Leasing overcomes budget limitations.** Most companies are hampered by capital budget limitations from time to time. Leasing allows businesses to acquire new equipment with easily affordable rental payments.
> * **Leasing provides security against equipment obsolescence.** Upgrade and trade-in options can easily be added to a lease agreement. In addition, there are no risks of equipment ownership, and lessees will never be required to resell or remarket obsolete equipment.
> * **Leasing can offer tax savings.** When properly structured, monthly lease payments may be fully tax deductible as an operating expense. This savings results in a lower after-tax equipment cost. Contact us to discuss tax advantages applicable to your specific situation.
> * **Payments are a fixed cost.** Monthly lease payments remain the same for the life of the lease, even if interest rates do not.
> * **Leasing provides a faster return on investment.** Revenues or savings created as a result of the equipment during the first month often will be in excess of the monthly lease payment, thereby providing an immediate return on investment.
> * **It is important to note that the common thread in each of these benefits is flexibility.** Lease payments and terms may be structured based on a businesses particular need. Equipment leasing can be an extremely valuable financial tool for growing businesses while staying competitive in today's marketplace.
> 
> A minimum total purchase value is required for leasing options. Not all customers will qualify for the leasing program. Please contact us to see if you qualify for our leasing program. **Please Note: All Leasing options are provided by third party equipment leasing companies.**
> 
> **7\. Promotions, Promotional Gifts.** Promotional items include any free items/gifts you receive with your order. Promotional items are only available on certain items, where stated. Promotions may be changed or revoked at any time. Promotional items may be shipped separately from your order via a different carrier and/or different service. Promotional items must be returned if you are returning your order (see return/exchange policy above). Promotional items may not be offered in the case of a quoted discount price or where a cash discount is provided. Unless otherwise stated, all promotional items are only available at the website price.
> 
> **8\. Order Acceptance Policy.** Your receipt of an electronic or other form of order confirmation does not signify our acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell. BlueAlly, Inc reserves the right at any time after receipt of your order to accept or decline your order for any reason. BlueAlly, Inc further reserves the right any time after receipt of your order, without prior notice to you, to supply less than the quantity you ordered of any item. Your order will be deemed accepted by BlueAlly, Inc upon shipment of products or performance of services that you have ordered, or upon the completion of the license and delivery of a Digital Download, as indicated by our servers. Title to goods and all risk of loss passes to you upon delivery to the common carrier.
