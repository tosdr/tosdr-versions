### **INFORMATION COLLECTED AUTOMATICALLY**

**Automatic Data Collection**. We may collect certain information automatically when you use the Services.  This information may include your Internet protocol (IP) address, user settings, MAC address, cookie identifiers, mobile advertising and other unique identifiers, details about your browser, operating system or device, location information ((including, the location of your tub if its connected to a mobile application, or, with your consent where required by law, precise location to help you find the closest dealer to your location, and inferred location based on your IP address), Internet service provider, mobile carrier, pages that you visit before, during and after using the Services, information about the links you click, information about how you interact with the Services, including the frequency and duration of your activities, items or keywords you search for, details about your search criteria, the Products that you browse, and other information about how you use the Services.

**Cookie Policy and Other Tracking Technologies** (e.g., Cookies, Pixel Tags/Web Beacons, and Analytics Information). We, as well as third parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality on the Services, may use cookies, pixel tags, local storage, and other technologies (“Technologies”) to automatically collect information through the Services. Technologies are essentially small data files placed on your device that allow us and our partners to record certain pieces of information whenever you visit or interact with our Services.

* **Cookies**. Cookies are small text files placed in device browsers to store their preferences. Most browsers allow you to block and delete cookies. However, if you do that, the Services may not work properly.
* **Pixel Tags/Web Beacons**. A pixel tag (also known as a web beacon) is a piece of code embedded in the Services that collects information about engagement on the Services. The use of a pixel tag allows us to record, for example, that a user has visited a particular web page or clicked on a particular advertisement. We may also include web beacons in e-mails to understand whether messages have been opened, acted on, or forwarded.
* **Analytics**. We may use Technologies and other third-party tools to process analytics information on our Services, such as Google Analytics and Adobe Analytics. To learn more about how to opt-out of Google Analytics’ use of your information on our Site, please click [here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

**How We Use Automatic Collection Technologies**.

We, as well as third parties that provide content, advertising, or other functionality on the Services, may use cookies, pixel tags, local storage, and other technologies to automatically collect information through the Services. Our uses of these Technologies fall into the following general categories:

* **Operationally Necessary**. This includes Technologies that allow you access to our Services, applications, and tools that are required to identify irregular site behavior, prevent fraudulent activity and improve security or that allow you to make use of our functionality;
* **Performance Related**. We may use Technologies to assess the performance of our Services, including as part of our analytic practices to help us understand how our visitors use the Services;
* **Functionality Related**. We may use Technologies that allow us to offer you enhanced functionality when accessing or using our Services. This may include identifying you when you sign into our Services or keeping track of your specified preferences, interests, or past items viewed;
* **Advertising or Targeting Related**. We may use first party or third-party Technologies, including cross-device tracking, to deliver content, including ads relevant to your interests, on our Services or on third-party sites.
* **Hotjar (Session Replay Analytics)**. We use Hotjar’s session replay analytics services. This allows us to record and replay an individual’s interaction with the Services. For more information about how Hotjar uses your personal information, please visit the “Personal Data collected from a visitor of a Hotjar Enabled Site” section of Hotjar’s Privacy Policy. To learn more about how to opt-out of Hotjar’s use of your information, please click [here](https://www.hotjar.com/policies/do-not-track/).

### **INFORMATION FROM OTHER SOURCES**

**Third-Party Organizations**. We may obtain information about you from other sources, including from third-party services and organizations where permitted by law. For example, if you purchase a Product with financing made available via a third-party financing provider, that provider may share personal information related to your order with us.

### **DISCLOSING YOUR INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES**

We may share your personal information with the following categories of third parties:

**Business Partners**. We may share your personal information with business partners to provide you with a product or service you have requested. We may also share your personal information with business partners with whom we jointly offer products or services.

**Service Providers**. We may share any personal information we collect about you with our third-party service providers. The categories of service providers to whom we entrust personal information include service providers for: (i) the provision of the Services; (ii) the provision of information, products, and other services you have requested; (iii) marketing and advertising; (iv) payment and transaction processing; (v) customer service activities; and (vi) the provision of IT and related services.

**Jacuzzi Dealers and Affiliates**. Jacuzzi is a global company that works with a network of trusted authorized resellers. We share your personal information with a Jacuzzi authorized dealer near you to facilitate Product sales, shipment, delivery, or installation as well as to provide maintenance and other services related to your Product. Where you consent and/or where permitted by law, we also share your personal information with other companies within the Jacuzzi family for marketing and sales purposes.

**Third-Party Financing Providers**. Some of our Products may be eligible for financing offered by third-party financing providers. If you interact with a third-party financing provider, they will collect the personal information that you provide to them. Please note that the third-party financing provider is directly collecting personal information from you and may process your information in accordance with its privacy policy. In addition, if you finance the purchase of a Product through a third-party financing provider, Jacuzzi will share personal information about your order with the third-party financing provider. We are not responsible for the third-party financing provider’s processing of your personal information.

**Advertising Partners**. Through our Services, we may allow third party advertising partners to set Technologies and other tracking tools to collect information regarding your activities and your device (e.g., your IP address, cookie identifiers, page(s) visited, location, time of day). These advertising partners may use this information (and similar information collected from other websites) for purposes of delivering targeted advertisements to you when you visit third party services within their networks. This practice is commonly referred to as “interest-based advertising”, “cross-context behavioral advertising” or “personalized advertising.” If you prefer not to share your personal information with third-party advertising partners, you may follow the instructions below.

**APIs/SDKs**. We may use third-party Application Program Interfaces (“APIs”) and software development kits (“SDKs”) as part of the functionality of our Services. For more information about our use of APIs and SDKs, please contact us as set forth below.

**Disclosures to Protect Us or Others**. We may access, preserve, and disclose any information we store in association with you to external parties if we, in good faith, believe doing so is required or appropriate to: (i) comply with law enforcement or national security requests and legal processes, such as a court order or subpoena; (ii) protect your, our, or others’ rights, property, or safety; (iii) enforce our policies or contracts; (iv) collect amounts owed to us; or (v) assist with an investigation and prosecution of suspected or actual illegal activity.

**Disclosure in the Event of Merger, Sale, or Other Asset Transfer**. If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, purchase or sale of assets, or transition of service to another provider, then your information may be sold or transferred as part of such a transaction, as permitted by law and/or contract.

We may share your information with third parties as appropriate and permitted by law. The privacy choices you may have about your personal information are determined by applicable law and are described below.

### **INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS**

All information processed by us may be transferred, processed, and stored anywhere in the world, including but not limited to, the United States or other countries, which may have data protection laws that are different from the laws where you live. We endeavor to safeguard your information consistent with the requirements of applicable laws. There may be additional information specific to your country, which may be found on the applicable Jacuzzi website.
