E. WonderHowTo takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User Submissions that you or any other Users or third parties post or send over the Service. You understand and agree that any loss or damage of any kind that occurs as a result of the use of any User Submissions that you send, upload, download, stream, post, transmit, display, or otherwise make available or access through your use of the Service, as between WonderHowTo and you, is solely your responsibility.
