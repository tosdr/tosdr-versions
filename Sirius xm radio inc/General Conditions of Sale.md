Return Policy
=============

**Effective: December 13 2023**  
If you are not completely satisfied with your recent radio or accessory purchase, you may return it within 30 days of receipt for a refund (excluding any shipping costs), provided you follow the steps below. Please note that we do not offer free returns. A UPS Prepaid Return Label was included in your order. If you choose to use this label, $8.00 will be deducted from your refund.

**Gift Cards and Prepaid Service Cards sold in the SiriusXM Shop are not eligible for refunds, returns or exchanges.**

**Steps to Return Your Radio/Accessory**

**1\. Cancel Your Subscription**. If you are returning a radio with an active subscription, you must call 1-800-422-7142 or chat online with an agent to cancel that subscription. Please be advised that your radio return and subscription are two separate transactions. **Returning your radio does not cancel your subscription.**

**2\. Create a Return Merchandise Authorization Number (RMA).** All returns must be accompanied by an RMA number in order to receive a refund.  
  
[Click here to start your return and create an RMA](https://shop.siriusxm.com/front/app/order/search). Be sure to have:

* The email address that was used to place the order
* Original order number

  
If your return arrives at our return center without an RMA number, you will not receive a refund. Include your RMA number in the space provided in the Return Information section of the packing slip and on the UPS Prepaid Return Label included in your original shipment. If you no longer have the packing slip or UPS Prepaid Return Label included in your original shipment, write the RMA number on whatever shipping label you use. Within your return package, please also include the following information:

* RMA number
* Model # or Name of Product Returned
* Reason for Return

  
**3\. Package your return.** Please include the completed Return Information form from your packing slip within the return package. If you no longer have your packing slip, include the following information on a piece of paper and place in your return package:

* RMA number
* Model # or Name of Product Returned
* Reason for Return

Please also remember to include all parts of the radio or accessory you are returning, including the radio receiver, kits, and manuals. The cost of any missing or damaged products will be deducted from your refund. All returns must be in new or like-new condition to be eligible for a refund. If you are using the original shipping carton for your return, remove all old shipping labels or markings in advance.

**4\. Ship your return to SiriusXM.** For your convenience, there is a UPS Prepaid Return Label on the packing slip included in your order. If you choose to use it, $8.00 for shipping will be deducted from your refund. Simply affix this label to the outer package, fill in your RMA number, and give the package to your UPS carrier or drop it off at any store that accepts UPS parcels or at any UPS collection box.  
  
You may return your purchase using a carrier other than UPS. Include your RMA number on the shipping label of your return. We recommend that you use a trackable method of shipment. If your shipment is lost for any reason, you will not receive a refund without proof of delivery. Hand-delivered returns will not be accepted.  
  
When you have everything ready to go, send to:  
SiriusXM Returns Processing  
c/o Dotcom Distribution  
300 Nixon Lane  
Edison, NJ 08837

**5\. We will process your refund upon receipt of return with RMA number.** You should see your net refund applied to the original method of payment after our receipt, inspection and acceptance of the product(s) returned. Please allow up to 8 weeks for your refund to be processed. Your bank or card issuer can take additional time to post to your account.

**We currently do not process exchanges.** You must follow the steps to process a return of the original product(s) purchased and order a replacement product from the SiriusXM Shop.

**Price Adjustments**  
We do not price match or provide price protection, adjustments or refunds in the event of a price drop or promotional offering.

**Please do not contact SiriusXM’s subscription customer service center for help with your SiriusXM Shop return. These representatives will not be able to assist you with your order. Please email [SiriusXMShopAssist@SiriusXM.com](mailto:SiriusXMShopAssist@SiriusXM.com) if further assistance is needed.**
