**FOR SELF-ACTIVATED TRIAL AND PAID SUBSCRIPTIONS: IF YOU DO NOT CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WITHIN SEVEN (7) DAYS OF RECEIPT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR FROM THE DAY YOU ARE ABLE TO USE OUR SERVICE, WHICHEVER IS SOONER, THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE LEGALLY BINDING ON YOU.**

YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH US & MANAGING YOUR COMMUNICATION PREFERENCES:** Your purchase or activation of a Subscription to any of our Services, whether directly or through a third party; your purchase or lease of a vehicle which includes a Subscription to our Services; or any other transaction with, or inquiry to, us or a third party relating to Subscriptions and/or our Services establishes a business relationship with us.

**2\. SUBSCRIPTIONS**

**a. PLANS:** Subscriptions are available in a variety of service tiers and packages and we refer to them in this Agreement as "**Plans**." Payment options vary by Plan. We reserve the right to change, rearrange, add, or delete content on the Service or in any Plan at any time, without notice. Further, we may modify, offer additional, or cease offering certain Plans or offers at any time, including adjusting pricing for any Plan, fees or components thereof, or modifying the availability of or eligibility requirements for certain Plans. We reserve the right to migrate you to another Plan at any time. Promotional offers and certain Plans may be subject to additional terms and eligibility requirements as set out in our offer details. Eligibility for a particular Plan or price does not guarantee its future availability to you, its transferability, or your eligibility for it on other radios or Subscriptions.

**b. AUTOMATIC RENEWAL:** Unless otherwise stated in the offer terms, a paid Subscription Plan, including those starting with a free period, will automatically renew for additional like periods (monthly, quarterly, annually) or other length described in our offer (each a "**Subscription Period**"), until cancelled. When you subscribe and provide a payment method, you authorize us to charge your payment method at the start of your subscription (or following any free period) and on an ongoing basis at the rates in effect at the time of each renewal, plus applicable fees and taxes without further notice to you (except as required by applicable law). You must cancel prior to your renewal date to avoid future charges. See Section 4 for how to cancel. We may, at our option, process your renewal on a month-to-month basis or, if you are on Plan with a multi-year renewal term, we may reduce the renewal term.

**c. TRIAL SUBSCRIPTIONS & EXTENDED SERVICE SUBSCRIPTIONS INCLUDED WITH A VEHICLE PURCHASE:** Subscriptions that are included with the purchase or lease of a vehicle do not automatically renew. Your service will stop at the end of the stated subscription term or your sale and/or transfer of the vehicle, whichever occurs first. THESE SUBSCRIPTION PLANS ARE NOT TRANSFERABLE TO ANOTHER RADIO/VEHICLE, ARE NOT REDEEMABLE FOR CASH OR CREDIT AND ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR REFUND, and the provisions in this Agreement concerning purchase, billing and refunds do not apply to these Subscriptions. Your purchase of a Subscription through an automaker or an automotive dealer is also subject to that entity’s terms of sale. If you wish to turn off the service in your vehicle you may follow the instructions as set forth in Section 4(a) below as if the subscription was purchased directly through us.

**3\. CANCELLATION, CHANGES TO YOUR PLAN AND REFUND POLICY**

**a. Your Right to Cancel:** You may cancel your Subscription purchased directly from us, including any free trial period, at any time to avoid future charges. See Section 4 below for how to cancel. The effective date of your cancellation depends on the Service you are subscribed to as described below in Sections 3(b) for Audio Subscriptions and 3(c) for Aviation, Marine, Infotainment and Commercial Fleet Subscriptions. Cancellations within a free trial period may become effective immediately.

**b. Audio Subscriptions Cancellation and Plan Changes**

**Audio Subscriptions Are Non-Refundable:** When you cancel an Audio Subscription, you are only cancelling future charges associated with your Subscription. Your cancellation will become effective at the end of your current Subscription Period (i.e., billing period), and no refunds or credits will be given for any partial period, except as provided below or as required by law.

**Monthly Billed Audio Plans:** If you cancel a monthly billed Subscription within seven (7) days of the start date of your Subscription, your Subscription will terminate immediately and any fees paid are eligible for a pro-rata refund, if requested. This 7-day right to cancel does not apply to subsequent monthly renewals. Cancellations after this 7-day period will be effective at the end of your current Subscription Period and any fees paid are **non-refundable**. Changes you make to your Plan will be effective at the end of your current Subscription Period, except for Service level upgrades (i.e., additional programming or listening options), in which case we will charge you the difference or apply a non-refundable credit toward your future renewal charges.

**Non-Monthly Billed Audio Plans:** These are Subscriptions that renew and bill for periods longer than one month, e.g. quarterly or annually billed Plans. If you cancel a non-monthly billed Subscription within thirty (30) days of the start of your Subscription or each subsequent renewal charge, your Subscription will terminate immediately and fees paid for that Subscription Period are eligible for a pro-rata refund, if requested. Cancellations or changes (excluding upgrades) to your Plan requested after this 30-day period will be effective at the end of your current (free or paid) Subscription Period and any fees paid are **non-refundable**. Service level upgrades (i.e., additional programming or listening options) will be applied upon request, in which case we will charge you any difference or apply a non-refundable credit toward your future renewal charges.

Audio Plans that include listening entitlements for a vehicle/satellite radio: Selling, losing, trading in your vehicle or not using the Service (or any part thereof) does not cancel your Subscription. You can transfer your Service to another vehicle, excluding plans set forth in Section 2(c) above. If you don’t have another vehicle, you can continue listening through the Streaming Service. No refunds or credits will be given if you don’t have an activated vehicle on your Plan or if you don’t use the Service. If we need to deactivate the Service in your vehicle and are unable to keep your Streaming Service on, we will cancel your Subscription and issue a pro-rata refund for any remaining pre-paid time. References to “vehicle” in this Agreement includes standalone satellite capable radios. See Section 2(c) for terms that apply to Trial Subscriptions and Extended Service Subscriptions included with a vehicle purchase.

**c. Aviation, Marine, Infotainment & Commercial Fleet:**

Unless otherwise stated in the Offer Details for your Plan, cancellation or changes for these Plans will be effective on the date we receive your request, or a later date that you accept or request. We will refund amounts paid in advance, on a pro-rata basis, less any applicable fees, unless stated otherwise in the specific offer that you accepted. If you change your Plan, we will charge you the difference and if the new fee is less than the fee you already paid for your current Plan, you may request the credit to remain on your account to be automatically applied to your future charges. Where a promotional offer is provided, other terms may apply.

**d. Cancellations By Us:**

We may cancel your Subscription if you fail to pay for your Subscription, breach this Agreement, or for any other reason in our sole discretion. **IF YOUR SUBSCRIPTION IS CANCELLED, YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYMENT OF ANY OUTSTANDING BALANCES ON YOUR ACCOUNT, INCLUDING ANY FEES YOU MAY INCUR OR MAY HAVE INCURRED.** We reserve the right to pursue any amounts you fail to pay or that arise in connection with our collection efforts, including bank overdraft fees and collections fees. No refunds will be given if your Subscription is suspended or where certain features are temporarily or permanently unavailable. If we need to deactivate the Service on your vehicle and cannot keep your Streaming Service on, we will cancel your subscription and issue a pro-rata refund for any remaining pre-paid time.

e. To the extent we issue any refund or credit on a non-refundable plan (other than as set forth in this Agreement) or provide a discount or other consideration to any subscriber, we do so only as an accommodation and at our sole discretion. If we do this for any reason it does not mean we are obligated to do so again, even in the same circumstance.

**d. Free Access Subscription Plan:** The Free Access Plan is our free advertising supported Subscription. You may be offered the opportunity to self-activate this Plan or we may activate your vehicle radio after your Trial Subscription or paid Subscription Plan. The Service will continue until: (i) you or we cancel this Plan; (ii) your radio is transferred; or (iii) you purchase a Subscription. The content available may differ depending on the capabilities of your radio and this Plan is not available on all radios. You agree that we may activate this Plan on your inactive radio and the availability of this Service is determined solely by us. If this Plan has been activated on your radio, you may cancel it as set forth in Section 4.

Subscriptions purchased through an External Service cannot be added or transferred to any account you may otherwise have directly with us, and such Subscriptions will not qualify for discounts or account features we offer. If you purchase a Subscription directly from us and you previously purchased a Subscription from an External Service, you must cancel your Subscription managed by that External Service in order to avoid duplicate charges. **If you purchased your Subscription through an External Service, you must cancel directly with such External Service**. You are responsible for reviewing and complying all terms and policies provided by the External Service before purchase. The External Service will be solely responsible for all communications with you regarding your Subscription account.

**8\. FINANCIAL MATTERS:** If you purchase a paid Subscription, you agree to pay us in advance as follows:

**a. Subscription Billing Payments**

**i. Card Billing:** You may pay by credit card, debit card, a SiriusXM® Prepaid Service card or gift card. Your card will be charged on the day you select the Subscription (or after any free period) and the day of each renewal according to the recurring billing plan you accepted. The timing of your billing may change as a result of a problem with your payment method, changes you make to your Subscription, Service suspension or where in the month you start your billing cycle. If your payment method details change or are due to expire, you agree we may obtain updated information regarding your selected payment method as made available by your financial institution or through a card updater service. For recurring payments, a gift card issuer may not permit you to use gift cards. Using a prepaid service or gift card may require a valid credit or debit card on your account for your future recurring charges. When you update your payment method in your account, you authorize us to charge the updated payment method for your Subscription.

**ii. Invoice Billing:** Invoice billing is not available for all Plans. If available, invoice is available by email (an “**e-bill**”) and in limited instances by mail (a “**paper invoice**”). You may be charged an Invoice Administration Fee for paper invoices. To make payment, write your SiriusXM Account Number on your paper check and mail it to the address on your invoice. You may also pay online with a credit or debit card by logging into your account. If you choose an e-bill you will receive an email with a link to your online account where you can view your e-bill and make your payment with a credit or debit card or via ACH payment (electronic debit from your account) as available. There is no Invoice Administration fee charged with an e-bill.

**b. Payments & Late Fees:** All payments must be made in U.S. Dollars. If you do not pay your balance, we will deactivate your Subscription for non-payment and charge a late fee. If you choose to reactivate your Subscription we may charge you an activation fee, and we will apply payments first to any past due amounts and then to your current and future obligations. For unpaid amounts, we reserve the right to retry your payment method which, if successful, will keep your Subscription active and it will continue to automatically renew.

**c. Taxes:** All amounts charged to your account may be subject to tax, which will vary according to the address on your account. You are responsible for keeping your account information up to date.

**d. Fees:** We may charge you one or more of the fees below, all of which are subject to change without notice. We reserve the right to waive any of these fees at our discretion.

* **U.S. Music Royalty Fee:** Plans which include music channels may be charged a U.S. Music Royalty Fee. See [www.siriusxm.com/usmusicroyalty](http://www.siriusxm.com/usmusicroyalty).
    
* **Invoice Administration Fee:** If you request to paper invoices, we may charge you an administration fee on each paper invoice rendered, except where prohibited.
    
* **Late Fee:** If payment is not received in a timely manner, we may charge you a late fee. This fee is not an interest charge, finance charge, or other charge of a similar nature.
    
* **Returned Payment Fee:** If any financial institution refuses to honor your payment, we may charge you a fee. This fee is not an interest charge, finance charge, or other charge of a similar nature and it is reasonably related to the actual expense we incur due to unsatisfied payment.
    
* **A La Carte Channel Change Fee:** If you have an "A La Carte" Plan, for each subsequent transaction to change your initial channel selections, you may be charged a fee.
    
* **Transfer Fee:** If you transfer a Subscription from one radio to another you may be charged a transfer fee.
    
* **Cancellation Fee:** Cancellation fees or early termination fees may be charged in connection with certain offers. Any applicable cancellation fees will be disclosed in the offer details for that offer.

Services that are suspended will be automatically reactivated on the earlier of the date requested, or the six-month anniversary of the date the paid Subscription was suspended.

**13\. RESOLVING DISPUTES**

**PLEASE READ THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. THESE DISPUTE RESOLUTIONS PROVISIONS PROVIDE THAT ANY DISPUTE MAY BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION. YOU ARE HEREBY WAIVING THE RIGHT TO GO TO COURT, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO A JURY. IN ARBITRATION, A DISPUTE IS RESOLVED BY AN ARBITRATOR, OR A PANEL OF ARBITRATORS, INSTEAD OF A JUDGE OR JURY.**

THESE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS SHALL SURVIVE THE TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.

Any legal or equitable claim relating to the Service, the Site, your Subscription, or this Agreement (a "**Claim**") will be resolved as follows:

**a. Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Claim Resolution Procedures:** To initiate an informal resolution to a Claim, the initiating party must send a written dispute notice to the other party by first class United States mail. If you initiate a Claim, send notice to Sirius XM Radio LLC, 1221 Avenue of the Americas, 35th Floor, New York, NY 10020, Attention: General Counsel. If we initiate a Claim, we will send our notice to the billing address on file with us. Neither of us may start a formal proceeding (except for Claims described in Section 13(e) below) for at least sixty (60) days after one of us notifies the other of a Claim in writing. Any notice must include (i) the claimant’s name, address, phone number, email address and, if applicable, SiriusXM account number; (ii) description of the nature and basis of the Claim; (iii) relevant facts regarding the Claim; (iv) a description of the nature and basis of the specific relief sought, including damages sought, if any, and a detailed calculation for them; and (v) a personally signed statement from the claimant (or a corporate representative if the claimant is Sirius XM) (and not their counsel, agent or other representative) verifying the accuracy of the contents of the notice. Such informal resolution request must be made individually and must concern only the initiating party’s dispute and no other person’s dispute.

After receipt of a completed dispute notice, the parties shall engage in a good faith effort to resolve the dispute for a period of sixty (60) days. If we and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the issues identified in the notice within sixty (60) days after the completed notice is received, you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding or a small claims court proceeding (if permitted by small claims court rules).

Compliance with this Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures section is a condition precedent to initiating arbitration. Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution procedures set forth in this Section 13(a). All of the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures are essential so that you and we have a meaningful opportunity to resolve disputes informally.

If any aspect of these requirements has not been met, a court of competent jurisdiction may enjoin the filing or prosecution of an arbitration. In addition, unless prohibited by law, the arbitration administrator may not accept, administer, assess, or demand fees in connection with an arbitration that has been initiated without completion of the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures. If the arbitration is already pending, it shall be administratively closed. Nothing in this paragraph limits the right of a party to seek damages for non-compliance with these Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures in arbitration.

**b. Formal Resolution:** If we cannot resolve a Claim informally, then the Claims shall be resolved, upon election by either party, exclusively and finally by binding arbitration. Any demand for arbitration under this Agreement shall be made before the applicable statute of limitations to a Claim(s) has run.

**You and the Company agree that any issues concerning: (i) the arbitrability of any Claim; (ii) whether these arbitration provisions are unenforceable, unconscionable, applicable, valid, void or voidable; or (iii) the interpretation of this Agreement, including its arbitration provisions, will, in the first instance, be delegated to the arbitrator. However, any challenge to the validity or effect of the Class Action Waiver in paragraph (k) of this Section must be decided by a court. For the avoidance of doubt, an arbitrator will decide in the first instance whether a party is seeking the kind of individual public injunctive relief permitted by paragraph (k) of this Section.**

The party initiating arbitration must follow the rules and procedures of the American Arbitration Association (“**AAA**”) in effect at the time the Claim is filed, and the parties agree that the arbitration shall be administered by the AAA. You may obtain copies of the current rules, forms and instructions for initiating an arbitration by contacting:

American Arbitration Association  
1633 Broadway, 10th Floor  
New York, NY 10019  
Web site: [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/)

This arbitration agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“**FAA**”), and not by any state law concerning arbitration.

You and we agree that the party initiating arbitration must submit a certification that they (i) have complied with and completed the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures requirements contained in Section 13(a); and (ii) are a party to this agreement to arbitrate enclosed with or attached to the demand for arbitration. The demand for arbitration and certification must be personally signed by the party initiating arbitration (and their counsel, if represented).

**c. Confidentiality:** Upon either party’s request, the arbitrator will issue an order requiring that confidential information of either party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted court filing of confidential information must be done under seal to the furthest extent permitted by law.

**d. Arbitration Relief:** The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief, including a Claim for public injunctive relief brought in an individual capacity, and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual Claim. **TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL PROCEEDING**. Further, unless both you and we agree otherwise or as provided in this arbitration agreement, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s Claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, class, or private attorney general proceeding. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, any of these prohibitions on non-individualized declaratory or injunctive relief; class, representative, and private attorney general claims; or consolidation are found to be unenforceable with respect to a particular Claim or with respect to a particular request for relief (such as a request for injunctive relief sought with respect to a particular Claim), then the parties agree such a Claim or request for relief shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with Section 14(d), after all other arbitrable Claims and requests for relief are arbitrated.

You agree that any arbitrations between you and the Company will be subject to the Dispute Resolution Provisions in this Section 13 and not to any prior arbitration agreement you had with Company.

**e. Exceptions:** Notwithstanding the foregoing, any dispute involving a violation of the Communications Act of 1934, 47 U.S.C. §605, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, 18 U.S.C. §§2510-2521, or a violation of our intellectual property rights may be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction.

**f. Small Claims:** Instead of proceeding to arbitration, either you or we have the option to pursue a Claim in small claims court (or the equivalent) so long as the Claim 1) remains in that court, 2) is made solely on our behalf (if brought by us) or on your behalf, and 3) does not seek damages or other monetary relief in excess of $5,000. However, if that Claim is transferred or appealed to a different court, we reserve our right to elect arbitration.

**g. Arbitration Costs:** Whoever files the arbitration pays the initial filing fee. Except for Mass Arbitrations (see paragraph (i) below), if there is a hearing, we will pay any fees of the arbitrator and arbitration firm for the first day of that hearing. All other fees will be allocated as provided by the rules of the arbitration firm and applicable law. Each party will bear the expense of its own attorneys, experts, witnesses, and other expenses, regardless of which party prevails. If the arbitrator finds that either party’s Claim or the relief sought in the demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), the other party will have the right to recover its attorneys’ fees and expenses, including arbitration fees.

**h. Opt-out of Arbitration:** You may elect to exclude yourself from the agreement to arbitrate by sending a letter (an “**Opt-Out Notice**”) by first class United States mail to Sirius XM Radio LLC, 1221 Avenue of the Americas, 35th Floor, New York, NY 10020; Attention: General Counsel: Arbitration Opt-Out for Subscription Services. The Opt-Out Notice must include: (1) your first and last name; (2) your postal mailing address; (3) phone number; (4) email address; (5) your Radio ID/ESN (if your Subscription is for vehicle or portable radio); (6) Vehicle Identification Number (if your Subscription is for a vehicle radio); and (7) a clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with us through arbitration. You must personally sign the Opt-Out Notice (and not your counsel, an agent or other representative).

The Opt-Out Notice must be received no later than thirty (30) days from the date of purchase or the start of your Subscription, whichever comes first. You must submit a separate Opt-Out Notice for each of your Subscriptions. All other terms of this Agreement will continue to apply to your use of the Service and your Subscription, and this Agreement including the requirement to participate in Informal Dispute Resolution (Section 13 (a)), the Class Action Waiver (Section 13 (k)), and the Applicable Law provision (Section 14(d)). If you do not timely opt out of this agreement to arbitrate, such action shall constitute mutual acceptance of these arbitration terms. Opting out of these arbitration terms has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.

**i. Special Procedures for Mass Arbitration:** If twenty-five (25) or more similar Claims are asserted against us by or through the same or coordinated counsel or are otherwise coordinated, then the resolution of your dispute will be subject to these Special Procedures for Mass Arbitration. These Special Procedures for Mass Arbitration will apply whether or not such Claims are filed simultaneously. You also agree to the following coordinated bellwether process and application of the AAA Multiple Consumer Case Filing Fee Schedule and the AAA Mass Arbitration Supplementary Rules.

Counsel for the claimants and counsel for us shall each select ten (10) cases (per side) to proceed first in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a bellwether process. The parties may, but are not required to, agree in writing to modify the number of cases to be included in the bellwether process. The remaining cases shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration nor shall any AAA fees be assessed in connection with those cases until they are selected to proceed to individual arbitration proceedings pursuant to this provision.

In the bellwether process, a single arbitrator shall preside over each case. Only one case may be assigned to each arbitrator during the bellwether process unless the parties agree otherwise. These bellwether Claims will be resolved within one-hundred and twenty (120) days of the initial pre-hearing conference.

After decisions have been rendered in the first twenty (20) cases, we and all claimants shall engage in a global mediation in an attempt to resolve the remaining cases with the benefit of the decisions in the bellwether cases. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining cases after the mediation, each side shall select another ten (10) cases (per side) to proceed to individual arbitration proceedings as part of a second bellwether process.

After decisions have been rendered in the second group of twenty (20) cases, we and all claimants shall engage in a second global mediation in an attempt to resolve the remaining cases with the benefit of the decisions in the decided bellwether cases; if a global settlement cannot be reached in the second mediation, the parties also may discuss with the mediator the process for resolving the remaining cases with the benefit of the decisions in the first two (2) rounds of bellwether cases; the parties are not required to agree to any modifications to the process set forth herein.

Following the second global mediation, you or we may separately or by agreement, opt out of arbitration and elect to have your Claim heard in court consistent with this Agreement. You may opt out of arbitration by providing an Opt-Out Notice in accordance with Section 13(h), except this notice shall be provided within thirty (30) days after the conclusion of the second global mediation. We may opt your Claim out of arbitration by sending an individual notice of our intention to opt out to your counsel, signed by a corporate representative and sent by first class United States Mail within fourteen (14) days of the expiration of your thirty (30) day period to opt out.

Absent a settlement or agreement to modify the procedure for arbitrating the remaining cases (to the extent you or we have not opted-out), in order to increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of any remaining arbitrations, the arbitration provider shall: (i) administer the arbitration demands in batches of fifty (50) demands (to be randomly selected unless otherwise agreed by the parties) per batch (to the extent there are fewer than fifty (50) arbitration demands left over after the batching described above, a final batch will consist of the remaining demands); (ii) designate one (1) arbitrator for each batch; (iii) provide for a single filing fee due per side per batch; and (iv) not administer more than five (5) batches at any given time.

You agree to cooperate in good faith with us and the arbitration provider to implement such a “batch approach” or other similar approach to provide for an efficient resolution of Claims, including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of Claims. This “Batch Arbitration” provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing class arbitration of any kind. The remaining cases shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration nor shall any AAA fees be assessed in connection with those cases until they are selected for inclusion in a batch pursuant to this provision.

We do not agree or consent to class arbitration, private attorney general arbitration, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated Claims under any circumstances, except as set forth in this Section 13(i).

The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled for Claims subject to this Section 13(i) from the time these Special Procedures for Mass Arbitration are triggered until the time your Claim is selected to proceed, withdrawn, opted-out of these Special Procedures for Mass Arbitration or otherwise resolved.

A court shall have authority to enforce this Section 13(i) and, if necessary, to enjoin the mass filing or prosecution of arbitration demands against us.

**j. Injunctive Relief:** The provisions of this Section 13 will not apply to any legal action taken by us to seek an injunction or other equitable relief in connection with, any loss, cost, or damage (or any potential loss, cost, or damage) relating to our intellectual property rights, our operations, and/or our Services.

**k. Class Actions and Severability:** You do not have the right to act as a class representative or participate as a member of a class of claimants with respect to any Claim submitted to arbitration or litigation (to the extent you elect to Opt-Out of Arbitration) (“**Class Action Waiver**”). There shall be no right or authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class action basis or on bases involving Claims brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, as a private attorney general, or other Subscribers, or other persons similarly situated. The parties acknowledge and agree that under no circumstances will a class action be arbitrated. This paragraph shall be known as the “Class Action Waiver.”

The Class Action Waiver is material and essential to the arbitration of any disputes between the parties and is non-severable from this agreement to arbitrate Claims. If the Class Action Waiver is limited, voided or cannot be enforced, then the parties' agreement to arbitrate (except for this sentence) shall be null and void, subject to the right to appeal any limitation or invalidation of the Class Action Waiver. If this entire agreement to arbitrate is determined to be null and void, then the parties agree that any actions shall be brought in the State or Federal courts of New York, New York.

**l. Binding Effect:** In the arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged, as set forth in the FAA. Any court with jurisdiction may enter judgment upon the arbitrator’s award. The arbitrator's decision is final and binding on all parties and may be enforced in any federal or state court with jurisdiction.

**m. Amendments:** No amendment to this Agreement will retroactively modify the parties’ agreed-to dispute resolution provisions of this Agreement for then-pending disputes, unless the parties expressly agree otherwise in writing. For the avoidance of doubt, “then-pending disputes” means any legal action filed before any court or tribunal (such as the American Arbitration Association) prior to the effective date of the amendment.

Any specific terms that expressly or by their nature survive termination shall continue thereafter until fully performed. A waiver of any terms or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof.

**d. Applicable Law:** The interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflict of law principals. Any dispute that is not subject to arbitration as set forth in Section 13 of this Agreement or any issues involving the arbitrability or enforcement of any provision under Section 13 shall be brought in the appropriate state or federal court located in New York County, NY and we and you each irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state or federal courts in New York County, NY for the adjudication of all non-arbitral claims other than those brought in small claims court in accordance with Section 13(f).
