1\. COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
--------------------------------------

**1.1 Categories of Personal Information Collected.** The table below describes the categories of personal information (with non-exhaustive examples) that we may collect about you. We may also collect other personal information that is not specifically listed here, which we will use as described in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise disclosed at the time of collection.

|     |     |

| F. Inferences Drawn from Personal Information | We may create profiles using personal information we collect, such as propensity or likelihood to attend a first appointment. |

**1.2 Sources of Personal Information**. We obtain the categories of personal information listed above from a variety of sources, including the following:

* Personal Information You Provide. Company collects personal information when you voluntarily submit it to us. For example, we may collect or receive personal information from a user that uses our appointment scheduling service, provides information to our call center in order to schedule an appointment or consultation; signs up to receive promotional communications; participates in one of our surveys; posts a review on our services; submits a request to our customer service team; interacts with our social media pages; or otherwise interacts with us or other users through the Site.
    
* Automatically Collected Personal Information. We, our service providers, and our advertising partners may automatically log information about you, your computer, or mobile device, and your activity over time on our Site and on other sites and online services, such as the online identifiers, online activity information, and device information described in the table above. Like many online services, we use cookies and similar technologies to facilitate some of the automatic data collection described above, such as:
    
    * **Cookies**, which are text files that websites store on a visitor‘s device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser for the purpose of helping you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, remembering the items you place in your shopping cart, enabling functionality, helping us understand user activity and patterns, and facilitating online advertising.
        
    * **Web beacons**, also known as pixel tags or clear GIFs, which are typically used to demonstrate that a webpage or email was accessed or opened, or that certain content was viewed or clicked, typically to compile statistics about usage of websites and the success of marketing campaigns.
        
    * **Session-replay technologies**, which are third-party software used to record a video replay of users’ interactions with the Site. The video replay may include users’ clicks, mouse movements, scrolls, mobile app touches, typing, and other activity taken during the session. We use these replays for research and development purposes, such as to help us troubleshoot problems with the Site, understand how users interact with and use the Site, and identify areas for improvement.
        
* Personal Information Obtained from Third Parties. In addition to the personal information that we collect from you directly and automatically, Company may receive personal information about you from other third party sources. For example, we receive personal information from our business partners, our network of affiliated dental practices, or companies that provide personal information to supplement what we already know about users. We may merge or combine such personal information with the personal information we collect from you directly or automatically.
    
* Referrals. Users of the Site may have the opportunity to refer colleagues or other contacts to us and share their contact information. Please do not provide us with someone’s contact information unless you have their permission to do so.

This could include fulfilling your requests for consultations or products or services. It could also include processing purchases or other transactions. For example, if you share your personal information to request a quote or ask a question about our products or services, we will use that personal information to respond to your inquiry. If you provide your personal information to arrange a consultation, we will use such information to assist in scheduling.

We may use your personal information, including information about you gathered from third party sources, to verify your identity or determine your eligibility for some of our products, services, and promotions. For example, this may include verifying your age, date of birth, and place of residence. If you set up an account on the Site, we may use the registration information you provide in relation to that account creation to create, maintain, customize, and secure your account.
    
* For Marketing and Advertising. We use your personal information to provide you with Company-related marketing and promotions about our products, services, or Site. In addition, we also contract with third-party advertising companies and social media companies to help us advertise our business. These companies may use cookies and similar technologies to collect information about you (including the online identifiers, device data, and online activity data described above) over time across our Site and other sites and services or your interaction with our emails and use that information to serve ads that they think will interest you, to monitor and analyze the effectiveness of marketing activities, and to track your entries, submissions, and status in any promotions. These might be third party offers we think you might find interesting. You can learn more about your choices for limiting interest-based advertising, in the “Advertising Choices” section below.

4\. SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
------------------------------------

No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is fully secure. While we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information from the risks presented by unauthorized access or acquisition, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information. In the event that we are required by law to inform you of any unauthorized access or acquisition of your personal information we may notify you electronically, in writing, or by telephone, if permitted to do so by law.

5\. YOUR CHOICES

Note that we may send you a message to confirm receipt of your STOP request.

Many browsers accept cookies by default until you change your settings. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all functionality of the Site and it may not work properly. For more information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your browser and how to manage and delete them, visit www.allaboutcookies.org.

We use Google Analytics to help us understand user activity and patterns on the Site.

In addition, your mobile device settings may provide functionality to limit use of the advertising ID associated with your mobile device for targeted online advertising purposes. If you opt-out of interest-based advertisements, you will still see advertisements online but they may be less relevant to you.

Some of the third party advertising companies we work with offer their own opt-out options that you can use to limit their use of your information for interest-based advertising, such as Google ([info](file:///C:/Users/elocker/Dropbox%20(KO)/Clients%20A%20-%20F/Cultivate%20Advisors/Privacy/info) and [opt-out](https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated)). Please note that we also may work with companies that offer their own opt-out mechanisms or do not participate in the opt-out mechanisms described above. Even after using these opt-out mechanisms, you may receive interest-based advertising from other companies.

**5.6. Do Not Track**. Some Internet browsers may be configured to send “Do Not Track” signals to the online services that you visit. We currently do not respond to a “Do Not Track” signal. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” please visit [http://www.allaboutdnt.com](http://www.allaboutdnt.com/).

9\. NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS
----------------------------------

This section applies only to California residents and supplements the information in this Privacy Policy. It describes how we collect, use, sell, share, and retain personal information of California residents, and their rights with respect to that personal information. For purposes of this Notice to California Residents, “personal information” has the meaning given in the California privacy laws, but does not include information exempted from the scope of those laws.

**9.1. Personal Information Collected and Purposes of Collection and Use**. The categories of personal information we collect, or have collected in the 12 months preceding the “Last Updated” date of this Privacy Policy, and the sources of collection are listed in the section above titled “COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION.” The purposes, including the specific business and commercial purposes, for which we collect and use these categories of personal information are described in our general Privacy Policy under the section titled “USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION.”  
  
To the extent we collect sensitive personal information, we only use or disclose it for purposes permitted under California law (e.g., to operate the Site and provide our services, detect security incidents and prevent fraud, and to verify and maintain the quality of the Site). We do not collect or use sensitive personal information for the purpose of inferring characteristics about California residents.

**9.2. How Personal Information is Disclosed, “Sold,” or “Shared.”** Each of the categories of personal information listed in the “COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION” section above is disclosed for a business purpose to the parties identified in the section titled “DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION.” California law defines a “sale” as disclosing a California resident’s personal information to a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration. Where such disclosure is for cross-context behavioral advertising, whether or not for monetary or other valuable consideration, it qualifies as “sharing” under California law.

The table below describes how we “sell” and “share” personal information.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| #### Categories | #### Whether the category of personal information is “sold” or “shared” and to whom |
| A. Individual Identifiers and Demographic Information | Sold or shared to advertising partners. |
| B. Commercial Information | Sold or shared to advertising partners. |
| C. Internet or Network Activity | Sold or shared to advertising partners. |
| E. Audio, Electronic, Visual, or Similar Information | Not sold or shared. |
| F. Inferences Drawn from Personal Information | Not sold or shared. |

We have “sold” or “shared” the categories of personal information indicated above for purposes of advertising our Site (including tracking the success of our advertising campaigns), identifying new customers or potential customers, measuring activity on the Site, and the other purposes described in our general Privacy Policy under the section titled “USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION.” We do not knowingly “sell” or “share” the personal information of California residents under 16 years of age.

**9.3. Retention of Personal Information.** We will retain each of the categories of personal information listed above for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose of collection, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, to establish and defend legal claims, for fraud prevention purposes, or as long as required to meet our legal obligations. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

**9.4. Your California Privacy Rights.** As a California resident, in addition to the rights described in the general Privacy Policy, you have the rights listed below. However, these rights are not absolute, and in certain cases we may not be able to respond to your request, such as when a legal exemption applies or if we are not able to verify your identity.

* **Know/Access.** You can request the following information about how we have collected and used your personal information:
    
    * The categories of personal information that we have collected.
        
    * The categories of sources from which we collected personal information.
        
    * The business or commercial purpose for collecting, selling, or sharing personal information.
        
    * The categories of third parties with whom we disclose personal information.
        
    * A copy of the personal information that we have collected about you.
        
* **Delete.** You can ask us to delete the personal information that we have collected from you.
    
* **Correct.** You can ask us to correct inaccurate personal information that we maintain about you.
    
* **Opt-out of sales/sharing.** If we “sell” or “share” your personal information, you can opt-out.
    
* **Nondiscrimination.** You are entitled to exercise the rights described above without receiving discriminatory treatment.
    

**9.5. How to Exercise Your California Privacy Rights.** You may request to exercise the California privacy rights described above as follows:

* **Right to know/access, delete, or correct.** You can request to exercise your know/access, deletion, or correction rights by:
    
    * Visiting [Your Privacy Choices](https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/cf977528-88b0-4672-a78f-cc272b50db0e/c2f6ea17-cabe-4619-a005-20ce0e9b27c8); or
        
    * Calling 888-987-8698
        
* **Right to opt-out of the “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information**. You can request to opt-out out of the “sale” or “sharing” of your personal information by clicking the cookie icon in the sitewide footer or broadcasting the Global Privacy Control (GPC) signal. Note that due to technological limitations, if you visit our Site from a different computer or device, or clear cookies on your browser that store your preferences, you will need to return to this screen to select your preferences or rebroadcast the GPC signal. If you direct us not to sell/share your Personal Information, we will consider it a request pursuant to California’s “Shine the Light” law to stop sharing your personal information covered by that law with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
    

We reserve the right to confirm your California residence to process your requests and will need to confirm your identity to process your requests to exercise your right to know/access, delete, and correct. This is a security measure to, for example, help ensure we do not disclose information to a person who is not entitled to receive it. The identity verification process may vary depending on how you submit your request.  
  
Consistent with California law, you may designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. If you do so, we may require proof of your identification, the authorized agent’s proof of identification, and any other information that we may request in order to verify the request, including evidence of valid permission for the authorized agent to act on your behalf. We cannot process your request if you do not provide us with sufficient detail to allow us to understand and respond to it.  
  
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee or decline to comply with your request if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive.

10\. NOTICE TO COLORADO RESIDENTS

**10.3. How to Exercise Your Colorado Privacy Rights.** You may request to exercise the Colorado privacy rights described above as follows:

* **Right to access/port delete, or correct.** You can request to exercise your access/port, deletion, or correction rights by:

Note that due to technological limitations, if you visit our Site from a different computer or device, or clear cookies on your browser that store your preferences, you will need to return to this screen to select your preferences or rebroadcast the GPC signal.
    

  
**10.4. Authentication Process.** We reserve the right to confirm your Colorado residence to process your requests and will need to confirm your identity to process your requests. This is a security measure to, for example, help ensure we do not disclose information to a person who is not entitled to receive it. The identity verification process may vary depending on how you submit your request. We cannot process your request if you do not provide us with sufficient detail to allow us to understand and respond to it.

**10.5. Authorized Agents.** Consistent with Colorado law, you may designate an authorized agent to make an opt out request on your behalf using the method described above. If you do so, we may require proof of your identification, the authorized agent’s proof of identification, and any other information that we may request in order to verify the request, including evidence of valid permission for the authorized agent to act on your behalf.

**10.6. Right to Appeal.** If we decline to take action on your request, you may appeal such refusal by emailing us within a reasonable time period after we sent you our decision.
