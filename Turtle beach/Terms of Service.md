We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add or remove portions of the Terms of Use at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of the Site indicates your acceptance of any revised Terms of Use. The Terms of Use were most recently updated in April 2021.

All users, including those who are less than 18 years of age, should read our U.S. Privacy Policy [www.turtlebeach.com/pages/privacy](https://www.turtlebeach.com/pages/privacy) and EU Privacy Policy [eu.turtlebeach.com/pages/privacy](https://eu.turtlebeach.com/pages/privacy), [uk.turtlebeach.com/pages/privacy](https://uk.turtlebeach.com/pages/privacy) (collectively, the “Privacy Policies”) available on our Site. By agreeing to these Terms of Use, you also agree to the terms of the Privacy Policies. All personal information provided to us will be processed in accordance with the Privacy Policies. To the extent there are inconsistencies between these Terms of Use and the Privacy Policies, these Terms of Use will control.

All content on the Site is owned by Turtle Beach. You right to access and use the Site is limited to personal, non-commercial uses. Without the prior written consent of Turtle Beach, you may not copy, republish, distribute, transmit, transfer, sell, assign, license, sublicense, publicly display or reproduce in any manner the content of the Site for any commercial or public purpose.

By using the Site, you represent and warrant that all information you submit to us through the Site is truthful and accurate; you will maintain the accuracy of such information; you are 18 years of age or older; and your use of the Site does not violate these Terms of Use, or any applicable law or regulation. Your account profile may be deleted and your account may be terminated without warning if we believe that you are under 18 years of age, if we believe that you are under 18 years of age and you represent yourself as 18 or older, or if we believe you are over 18 and represent yourself as under 18. You may not use the Site in any manner which could damage, disable, overburden or impair the Site or interfere with any other party's use and enjoyment of the Site. You may not probe, scan or test the vulnerability of the Site or use any robot, spider, scraper or other automated means to access the Site without our express written permission. However, the provision in the prior sentence shall not apply to indexing or updating of search engines. You may not access, or attempt to access, any non-public portion of the Site or any personal information about a user (other than personal information about you). Turtle Beach reserves the right to monitor your use of the Site and to monitor your compliance with these Terms of Use. By using the Site, you acknowledge and consent to such monitoring.

USE OF PUBLIC FORUMS AND BULLETIN BOARDS

* * *


-------------------------------------------------

The Site may contain bulletin board services, chat areas, news groups, forums, communities, personal web pages, calendars, and/or other message or communication facilities designed to enable you to communicate with the public at large or with a group (collectively, "communication services"). You agree to use the communication services only to post, send and receive messages and material that are proper and related to the particular communication service. By way of example, and not as a limitation, you agree that when using a communication service, you will NOT:

>   

> • Defame, abuse, harass, stalk, threaten or otherwise violate the legal rights (such as rights of privacy and publicity) of others.  
>   

> • Publish, post, upload, distribute or disseminate any unlawful, fraudulent, inappropriate, profane, libelous, defamatory, infringing, racist, sexist, abusive, obscene, indecent, unlawful or otherwise objectionable topic, name, material or information.  
>   

> • Upload files that contain software or other material protected by intellectual property laws (or by rights of privacy of publicity) unless you own or control the rights thereto or have received all necessary consents.  
>   

> • Upload files that contain viruses, corrupted files, or any other similar software or programs that may damage the operation of another's computer.  
>   

> • Advertise or offer to sell or buy any goods or services for any business purpose, unless such communication service specifically allows such messages.  
>   

> • Use the Turtle Beach name, domain name, trademark, logo or insignia in your user or screen name or in any other manner that would imply you are affiliated with Turtle Beach.  
>   

> • Pretend that you are, or that you represent someone else or impersonate any other person.  
>   

> • Conduct or forward surveys, contests, pyramid schemes or chain letters.  
>   

> • Use the Site to direct traffic to other websites.  
>   

> • Download any file posted by another user of a communication service that you know, or reasonably should know, cannot be legally distributed in such manner.  
>   

> • Falsify or delete any author attributions, legal or other proper notices or proprietary designations or labels of the origin or source of software or other material contained in a file that is uploaded.  
>   

> • Restrict or inhibit any other user from using and enjoying the communication services.  
>   

> • Violate any code of conduct or other guidelines which may be applicable for any particular communication service.  
>   

> • Harvest or otherwise collect information about others, including e-mail addresses, without their consent.  
>   

> • Violate any applicable laws or regulations.  
>   

Any of your submission through the communication services may be routed through our servers, third party servers on our behalf, and the Internet (where it may be viewed by general public), and therefore, you have no expectation of privacy for any submitted content. Since we cannot guarantee security of information submitted through communication services, your use is at your own risk. Turtle Beach has no obligation to monitor the communication services either. However, Turtle Beach reserves the right to review materials posted to a communication service and to remove any materials in its sole discretion. Turtle Beach reserves the right to terminate your access to any or all of the communication services at any time without notice for any reason whatsoever.  
  

Always use caution when giving out any personally identifying information about yourself or your children in any communication service. Turtle Beach does not control or endorse the content, messages or information found in any communication service and, therefore, Turtle Beach specifically disclaims any liability with regard to the communication services and any actions resulting from your participation in any communication service. Managers and hosts are not authorized Turtle Beach spokespersons, and their views do not necessarily reflect those of Turtle Beach.  
  

Materials uploaded to a communication service may be subject to posted limitations on usage, reproduction and/or dissemination. You are responsible for adhering to such limitations if you download the materials.

MATERIALS PROVIDED TO TURTLE BEACH OR POSTED ON THE SITE

RISK OF LOSS

* * *


---------------------

All products purchased from the Site, whether placed within or outside the United States, are transported and delivered to you by an independent carrier not affiliated with, or controlled by, Turtle Beach. Title to products purchased on the Site, as well as the risk of loss for such products, pass to you when Turtle Beach delivers these items to the carrier.

GOVERNING LAW

* * *


----------------------

To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Terms of Use are governed by the laws of the state of New York, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would cause the application of laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the state of New York, and you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the federal courts located in the Southern District of New York in all disputes arising out of or relating to the use of the Site.

The headings in these Terms of Use are for convenience only and shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of these Terms of Use. Except as otherwise specified herein, the Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and Turtle Beach with respect to the Site and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral or written, between you and Turtle Beach with respect to the Site.
