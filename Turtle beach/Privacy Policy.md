COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES

* * *


------------------------------------------------

On occasion, Turtle Beach may use third-party advertising companies that use tracking technologies to serve our advertisements based on your online browsing history and interests across the Internet. These advertising networks, social media companies, and other third-party services may collect information about your use of our Services and third-party websites and your interaction with our advertising and other communications. Typically, though not always, the information used for interest-based advertising is collected through cookies or similar tracking technologies. We may share a common account identifier (such as an email address or user ID) or hashed data with our third-party advertising partners to help identify you across devices. These advertising companies serve ads on behalf of us and others on nonaffiliated sites, and some of those ads may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on information collected about your use of the Services and elsewhere over time. We and our third-party partners use this information to make the advertisements you see online more relevant to your interests, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution, analytics, and market research. You have the choice to tell us not to collect and use this information, and in some jurisdictions, we will only engage in interest-based advertising if you opt-in. To learn more about interest-based advertising and how you may be able to opt out of some of this advertising, you may wish to visit the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (DAA) resources and/or the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”)’s online resources, at [http://www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices) or [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices), and you can opt out of receiving some interest-based advertisements on mobile apps by visiting [http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices](http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices). You may also be able to limit interest-based advertising through the settings menu on your mobile device by turning off “personalized ads” (iOS) or selecting “opt-out of interest-based ads” (Android). You may also be able to opt out of some—but not all—interest-based advertising served by mobile ad networks by visiting [http://youradchoices.com/appchoices](http://youradchoices.com/appchoices) and downloading the mobile AppChoices app.

  

Google Analytics and Advertising. We use Google Analytics to recognize you and link the devices you use when you visit our site or Services on your browser, log in to your account on our Services, or otherwise engage with us. We share a unique identifier with Google to facilitate the service. Google Analytics allows us to better understand how our users interact with our Services and to tailor our advertisements and content to you. For information on how Google Analytics collects and processes data, as well as how you can control information sent to Google, review Google’s site “How Google uses data when you use our partners’ sites or apps” located at [www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](https://www.turtlebeach.com/pages/www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/). You can learn about Google Analytics’ currently available opt-outs, including the Google Analytics Browser Ad-On here [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/).

  

We may also utilize certain forms of display advertising and other advanced features through Google Analytics, such as Remarketing with Google Analytics, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager Integration, and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. These features enable us to use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick advertising cookie) or other third-party cookies together to inform, optimize, and display ads based on your past visits to the Services. You may control your advertising preferences or opt out of certain Google advertising p roducts by visiting the Google Ads Preferences Manager, currently available at [https://google.com/ads/preferences](https://google.com/ads/preferences), or by visiting NAI’s online resources at [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices).

Please refer to the privacy policies of the applicable third-party website or service to learn about how they handle your personal information before disclosing any personal information.

OUR SERVICES ARE INTENDED FOR CUSTOMERS IN THE UNITED STATES

* * *


---------------------------------------------------------------------

Turtle Beach’s server is located in the United States. We, as a U.S. based company, do not solicit or knowingly collect personal data from individuals located outside of the United States through the Services. If you are located outside the United States and choose to contact us and send us personal information voluntarily (e.g., by placing an order online via our Services), please be advised that your personal information will be processed in the United States and that the protection of your personal information in the United States may be different from data protection in the country where you reside. Where this occurs, you acknowledge and where required, consent to such transfer in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

  

You are also advised to consider before you voluntarily send personal information to us that there might not be an independent data protection authority and/or safeguards of the data processing principles and/or safeguards of data subject rights in the U nited States as set forth under your data protection law, unless such rights are explicitly mentioned in this Privacy Policy.

TEXT MARKETING AND NOTIFICATIONS

* * *


-----------------------------------------

By entering your phone number in the checkout and initializing a purchase, subscribing via our subscription form, or a keyword, you agree that we may send you text notifications (for your order, including abandoned cart reminders) and text marketing offers. Text marketing messages will not exceed 30 a month. You acknowledge that consent is not a condition for any purchase.

  

If you wish to unsubscribe from receiving text marketing messages and notifications reply with STOP to any mobile message sent from us or use the unsubscribe link we provided you within any of our messages. You understand and agree that alternative methods of opting out, such as using alternative words or requests will not be accounted for as a reasonable means of opting out. Message and data rates may apply.

  

For any questions please text HELP to the number you received the messages from. You can also contact us for more information. If you wish to opt out please follow the procedures above.

DATA SECURITY AND RETENTION

* * *


------------------------------------

Please be aware that, despite our reasonable efforts to protect your information, no transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed 100% secure, as no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to or from the Services, and you do so at your own risk.

  

Please keep in mind that if you disclose personal information through public forums and bulletin boards on the Services, this information may be collected and used by others. You are responsible for the personal information that you choose to share on the Services’ public forums and bulletin boards.

  

We will retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected and processed, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, accounting, or reporting requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period for your personal information, we will consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk from unauthorized use or disclosure, the purposes for which we process personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and applicable legal requirements.

U.S. STATE PRIVACY SUPPLEMENT

* * *


--------------------------------------

Our [U.S. State Privacy Supplement](https://www.turtlebeach.com/pages/US-privacy-Supplement) (“Supplement”) provides additional information about our personal information processing practices in accordance with certain state privacy law requirements, including the California Consumer Privacy Act. Unless otherwise expressly stated, all terms defined in the Supplement retain the same meaning in this Privacy Policy.  
  

OPTING OUT OF PROMOTIONAL MAIL AND EMAILS

If you have previously opted to receive, or otherwise currently receive, promotional emails from us, you may unsubscribe by clicking the “unsubscribe” link in the email or by emailing us at [privacy@turtlebeach.com](mailto:privacy@turtlebeach.com).
