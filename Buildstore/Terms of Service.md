To&nbsp;request compensation, simply reach out to&nbsp;our Support team via <a href='mailto:help@builds.io'>help@builds.io</a>.</p> <p>The activation process for your device begins as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;you set up&nbsp;your profile after completing the subscription payment.</p> <p>The activation process can take anywhere from one hour to&nbsp;three days. This timeframe is&nbsp;necessary to&nbsp;register your device within the Developer Certificate and for Apple to&nbsp;verify&nbsp;it. If&nbsp;you have any questions about the registration process of&nbsp;your device, don&rsquo;t hesitate to&nbsp;contact our Support team via <a href='mailto:help@builds.io'>help@builds.io</a>.</p> <p>Each subscription is&nbsp;valid for one device only. Paid and activated subscriptions cannot be&nbsp;transferred from one device to&nbsp;another. Separate subscriptions must be&nbsp;purchased for each new device.</p> <p>Our service is&nbsp;available for access through a&nbsp;monthly subscription, offering three distinct Plans for purchase:</p> <ul> <li>Standard Plan priced at&nbsp;$19.99</li> <li>Adult Plan priced at&nbsp;$9.99</li> <li>Full Access Plan priced at&nbsp;$19.99</li> </ul> <p>For each subscription, we&nbsp;provide a&nbsp;minimum of&nbsp;27&nbsp;days of&nbsp;service and offer compensation as&nbsp;outlined in&nbsp;item&nbsp;B of&nbsp;these Terms of&nbsp;Service. However, for the actual expiration date of&nbsp;your subscription, please refer to&nbsp;your account&rsquo;s device and subscription page, accessible by&nbsp;logging in&nbsp;to&nbsp;your Builds.io account.</p> <p>By&nbsp;purchasing a&nbsp;Builds.io subscription, you understand and agree that we&nbsp;have the right to&nbsp;suspend your subscription at&nbsp;any time without requiring a&nbsp;request from you. Furthermore, if&nbsp;we&nbsp;detect any illegal activity or&nbsp;actions, your subscription will be&nbsp;immediately canceled. Please rest assured that all your account information, including your UDID and email address, will remain strictly confidential. We&nbsp;encrypt this data in&nbsp;our secure database to&nbsp;ensure the utmost security and privacy for all Builds.io users. Additionally, please remember that you are solely responsible for how you download and use the applications provided by&nbsp;Builds.io.</p> <p>The User has the right to&nbsp;a&nbsp;refund in&nbsp;case we&nbsp;cannot provide the service and cannot resolve the issue within a&nbsp;reasonable timeframe.

This will ensure you aren&rsquo;t charged for the following cycle. If&nbsp;any subscription plan becomes unavailable, we&nbsp;may terminate your ongoing subscription so&nbsp;it&nbsp;won&rsquo;t renew upon expiration.</p> <p>Builds.io cannot be&nbsp;held liable to&nbsp;you or&nbsp;any third party for any modifications, price changes, suspensions, or&nbsp;discontinuations of&nbsp;the Service.</p> <p>To cancel your subscription, please proceed through your account page.
