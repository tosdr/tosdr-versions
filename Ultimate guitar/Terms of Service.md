3\. SERVICE FEES
----------------

3.1 By registering for the Service, you agree to pay the fees designated for the Service level you select and in accordance with this section 3.1. Additional charges may include purchases you make or service level changes you request. Subject to your right to terminate the Service prior to the expiration of a Trial Period (defined hereinafter), if any, as described in Section 3.3 below, you agree to pay the applicable amounts for the minimum period specified therein. The term "month" (or "monthly") is defined herein as a 30-day cycle; "quarter" (or "quarterly") is defined herein as a 90-day cycle; "semiannual" (or "semiannually" or "6-month") is defined as a 180-day cycle; "year" (or "annual" or "annually") is defined as a 360-day cycle; and "biennial" (or "biennially" or "two-year") is defined herein as a 720-day cycle. A “lifetime” subscription is valid as long as the Service is being offered. If you access the Service via the iOS platform, payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase

3.2 Your subscription will continue automatically at the fee rate applicable to the Service, which you have selected unless terminated by Ultimate Guitar or until you notify Ultimate Guitar of your decision to cancel your subscription to the Service via your account portal. See the Section entitled "Termination / Cancellation" for cancellation instructions. All subscriptions require a commitment for a minimum period(s) of time ("Service Level Period") and, consequently, cannot be cancelled until the end of the Service Level Period. You may, at any time during your subscription period, set your account to cancel, or select another monthly, quarterly , semiannual, or annual subscription plan into which to renew, effective at the end of your then-current plan. At the end of your monthly, quarterly, semiannual, or annual subscription period(s), your subscription will automatically renew (the “Renewal Date”) and you will be billed for a monthly, quarterly, semiannual, annual or biennial subscription respectively at your then-current plan level, unless you elect to terminate the Service pursuant to Section 4 at the rates in effect when the charges were incurred. All fees and charges are nonrefundable. You will receive an email notice approximately 30 days prior to the Renewal Date. The notice will let you know that your current subscription term is about to end and the Renewal Date when your subscription will be renewed and your account charged. All notices regarding your subscription will be sent to your last email of record. Please keep a record of when your subscription term ends and the next Renewal Date. You are responsible for timely canceling your subscription regardless of whether you receive any notice from us. Monthly or yearly subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. The account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours before the end of the current period. You can manage your subscription - change or cancel auto-renewal - in your Account Settings after purchase

3.3 If, when registering, you signed up for a subscription with a "Trial Period," you will be allowed a period during which you can try out the Service. Only one Trial Period is permitted per person. Certain Content may not be available for access during your Trial Period. The Trial Period will expire upon the last day of the number of days indicated in the Trial Period offer concerned ("Expiration of the Trial Period"). (Please refer to the confirmation provided on the site and via email for the specific terms of your Trial Period). If you terminate the Service prior to the Expiration of the Trial Period, you will not have any further obligation with respect to the version of the Service to which you have committed and any remaining Trial Period credits will expire. If you do not terminate and do nothing, at the Expiration of the Trial Period, you will be automatically subscribed to the UG Pro Service and billed based on the payment plan selected when you registered (or as you may have updated through the "Your Account" section of the Service). By signing up to a Trial Period, you understand and agree that: (i) you will be required to provide billing payment method upon registration; (ii) Ultimate Guitar will obtain a pre-authorization for the fee amount that you will be charged at the Expiration of the Trial Period. It is possible that some financial institutions may perceive these requested amounts as actual pending charges. These are not actual charges however, and you are solely responsible for any rules that your credit card company applies to them, such as overdraft fees. A purchased subscription activates immediately and eliminates any unused portion of a free trial period

3.4 Payment must be made by a major credit card accepted by Ultimate Guitar (currently, VISA, MasterCard, American Express and Discover), or any other methods of payment as Ultimate Guitar may accept from time to time. If Ultimate Guitar does not receive payment from the credit card issuer or its agent, you agree to pay all amounts due upon demand by Ultimate Guitar. Your card issuer agreement governs your use of your designated card in connection with the Service, and you must refer to that agreement and not this Agreement to determine your rights and liabilities as a cardholder. YOU, AND NOT ULTIMATE GUITAR, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ANY AMOUNTS BILLED TO YOUR CREDIT CARD BY A THIRD PARTY, WHICH WERE NOT AUTHORIZED BY YOU. If you want to designate a different credit card or there is a change in credit card validity or expiration date, or if you believe someone has accessed the Service using your IDs without your authorization, you must contact Ultimate Guitar immediately at [\[email protected\]](https://ultimate-guitar.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)

3.5 If Ultimate Guitar does not receive the full amount of your Service account balance within thirty (30) days of the Billing Date, a late payment charge of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month (or the highest amount allowed by law, whichever is lower) may be added to your bill and immediately become due and payable. Unless you notify Ultimate Guitar of any discrepancies within sixty (60) days after they first appear on your account statement, they will be deemed accepted by you for all purposes, including resolution of inquiries made by your card issuer. You release Ultimate Guitar from all liabilities and claim of loss resulting from any error or discrepancy that is not reported to Ultimate Guitar within sixty (60) days of its first appearance on an invoice or credit card statement.

3.6 You agree to pay Ultimate Guitar all reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred by Ultimate Guitar to collect any past due amounts. Your account may be deactivated without further notice if payment is past due, regardless of the dollar amount. You agree to pay any outstanding balance in full within thirty (30) days of cancellation or termination of your Service account.

3.7 The fees, charges and payments hereunder do not include and you are solely responsible for paying any taxes, duties, government levies or other charges imposed by a taxing or other regulatory authority relating to your use of the Service. You are solely responsible for arranging payment for any and all additional or premium charges for your use of any third party services via the Service.

3.8 ULTIMATE GUITAR RESERVES THE RIGHT, AT ANY TIME, TO CHANGE ITS FEES AND BILLING METHODS, INCLUDING THE ADDITION OF SUPPLEMENTAL FEES OR SEPARATE CHARGES FOR CONTENT, OR SERVICES PROVIDED BY ULTIMATE GUITAR. If any such change is unacceptable to you, you may cancel your subscription to the Service, as provided in Section 4. YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THE SERVICE FOLLOWING THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF A CHANGE TO SUCH FEES AND BILLING METHODS SHALL CONSTITUTE YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH CHANGE. 

3.9 Ultimate Guitar iOS services are: Tab Pro Multitrack Guitar Tabs, Tabs & Chords HD, Ultimate Guitar: Tabs & Chords and Tabs & Chords - learn and play.

4\. TERMINATION /CANCELLATION/ REFUNDS

If you cancel your subscription, Ultimate Guitar will not refund any remaining portion of your subscription fees except as expressly provided for herein. Please note that, following cancellation of your subscription to the Service, you will not be able to access the Service

* For monthly subscriptions, you may cancel your monthly subscription anytime during the month however, you will not receive a refund for the current month's subscription (which will remain active for the remainder of that month's subscription term) and your payment method will not be charged for any subsequent monthly billing periods; as a courtesy to you we will convert your account to a free account.

* For subscriptions other than monthly subscriptions, if you cancel your subscription _during the first fourteen (14) days_ of your subscription term you will receive a refund of the difference between the then-in-effect and current subscription fee to which You are subscribed and the then-in-effect and current monthly subscription fee. Your account will not auto-renew for any recurring periodic charges at the end of the subscription term. As a courtesy to you we will convert your Account to a free account at the end of the 30-day period.

Your non-termination or continued use of the Service reaffirms that Ultimate Guitar is authorized to charge your payment method. We may submit those charges for payment and you agree you will be responsible for such charges. This does not waive our right to seek payment directly from you.

4.2 We may terminate this Agreement, restrict, suspend or terminate your use of the Service immediately and without notice or liability, if you violate, breach or fail to comply with this Agreement in any way, and it will not limit any other rights or remedies which are available to us.

7\. USER GENERATED CONTENT

7.1 The Service may, but is not obligated to, offer interactive features that allow Registered Users to, among other things, submit or post Content ("User Generated Content") or links to third party Content on areas of the Service accessible and viewable by other users of the Service and the public. If you are a Registered User, you represent and agree that any use by you of such features, including any User Generated Content or links submitted or posted by you, shall be your sole responsibility, shall not infringe or violate the rights of any other party or violate any laws, contribute to or encourage infringing or otherwise unlawful conduct, or otherwise be obscene, objectionable or in poor taste, and that you have obtained all necessary rights, licenses or clearances. Registered Users also further agree to provide accurate and complete information in connection with your submission or posting of any User Generated Content on the Service. "User Generated Content" includes, without limitation, tablatures (text or electronic), reviews, videos, photos, articles, audio files, applications and any other content whether copyrightable or not.

7.2 Ultimate Guitar does not claim any ownership rights in User Generated Content that you transmit, submit, display or publish ("post") on, through or in connection with the Service. After posting your User Generated Content on, through or in connection with the Service, you continue to retain any such rights that you may have in your User Generated Content, subject to the limited license herein. By posting any User Generated Content on, through or in connection with the Service, you hereby grant to Ultimate Guitar a limited license to use, modify, delete from, add to, publicly perform, publicly display, reproduce, and distribute such User Generated Content solely on, through or in connection with the Service, including, without limitation, through the Service to applications, widgets, websites or mobile, desktop, including, without limitation, distributing part or all of the Service and any User Generated Content included therein, in any media formats and through any media channels, including without limitation, third party social media and streaming platforms, and shall constitute a waiver of any rights, ''moral rights,'' or any similar rights under any jurisdiction. Except as expressly provided for herein, this limited license does not grant Ultimate Guitar the right to sell or otherwise distribute your User Generated Content outside of the Service.

7.3 The license you grant to Ultimate Guitar is non-exclusive (meaning you are free to license your User Generated Content to anyone else in addition to Ultimate Guitar), fully-paid and royalty-free (meaning that Ultimate Guitar is not required to pay you or anyone else deriving rights from you for the use on the Service of the User Generated Content that you post), sublicensable (so that Ultimate Guitar is able to use its affiliates, subcontractors and other partners such as Internet content delivery networks and wireless carriers to provide the Service), and worldwide (because the Internet and the Service is global in reach)

7.4 Following termination or deactivation of your account, or if you remove any User Generated Content from Ultimate Guitar, we may keep your User Generated Content for a reasonable period of time for backup, archival, or audit purposes. Ultimate Guitar and its users may retain and continue to use, store, display, reproduce, re-pin, modify, create derivative works, perform, and distribute any of your User Generated Content that other users have stored or shared on Ultimate Guitar.

7.5 Ultimate Guitar reserves the right not to post or publish any User Generated Content, and to delete, remove or edit any User Generated Content, at any time in its sole discretion without notice or liability.

7.6 Ultimate Guitar has the right, but not the obligation, to monitor any information and User Generated Content submitted or posted by you or otherwise available on the Service, to investigate any reported or apparent violation of this Agreement, and to take any action that Ultimate Guitar in its sole discretion deems appropriate

7.7 Rights Granted to Registered Users:

(a) Tablature Rights. Subject to any third party restrictions, Ultimate Guitar grants to Registered Users a nonexclusive right and license, solely on or through the Service, to (i) create Tablatures based upon the compositions that we have licensed from third party publishers and writers (the "Licensed Compositions"); and (ii) reproduce, distribute and display the Tablatures (or any portion thereof) on or through the Service.

(b) Lyric Rights. Subject to any third party restrictions, Ultimate Guitar grants to Registered Users a nonexclusive right and license, solely on or through the Service, to include and display the lyrics of the Licensed Compositions, in whole or in part, in conjunction with the Tabs and independently of the Tabs (the "Lyrics Rights").   
  
(c) Demonstration Rights. Subject to any third party restrictions, Ultimate Guitar grants to Registered Users a nonexclusive right and license, solely on or through the Service, to (i) record the Licensed Compositions as audio files, (ii) record the Licensed Compositions in synchronization with visual images; and (iii) perform publicly the Licensed Compositions and any reproductions in conjunction with or in lieu of the Tablatures (collectively the "Demonstration Rights").

(d) The Licensed Composition to Tablature Rights, the Demonstration Rights and the Lyrics Rights as provided hereunder are collectively referred to hereunder as the "Rights Granted." For purposes of clarification and the avoidance of doubt, the Rights Granted are only granted to Registered Users of the Service and not to any other users of or visitors to the Service.

(e) Ownership and Reservation of Rights. Except for the Rights Granted hereunder, and subject to any third party restrictions, the respective Content Providers retain all right, title and interest in and to the Licensed Compositions and nothing in this Agreement shall (or shall be construed to) restrict, impair, transfer, license, convey or otherwise alter or deprive the respective Content Providers of any of their rights or proprietary interests in any intellectual property, content, data, information or any other materials or rights, tangible or intangible.

8\. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES
----------------------------

YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT USE OF AND ACCESS TO THE SERVICE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND AN "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. WE DO NOT MAKE, AND HEREBY DISCLAIM, ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES REGARDING THE SERVICE, THE ULTIMATE GUITAR SITE AND THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OFFERED THROUGH THE SERVICE OR ANY PORTION THEREOF, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING (WITHOUT LIMITATION) IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. OR ANY WARRANTIES ARISING BY COURSE OF DEALING OR CUSTOM OF TRADE. WE MAKE NO REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY THAT ANY MATERIAL, CONTENT, PRODUCTS OR SERVICES DISPLAYED ON OR OFFERED THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE ACCURATE, COMPLETE, APPROPRIATE, RELIABLE, OR TIMELY. WE ALSO MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES THAT THE SERVICE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS AND/OR YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, FREE OF VIRUSES, MALICIOUS CODE, OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, OR OTHERWISE SECURE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES. ACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

9\. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
---------------------------

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ULTIMATE GUITAR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (A) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICE; (B) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES; OR (C) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL ULTIMATE GUITAR'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICE EXCEED ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS (U.S. $100.00).

If we cause damage to you and you're a consumer in the EEA, the above doesn’t apply. Instead, Ultimate Guitar’s liability will be limited to foreseeable damages arising due to a breach of material contractual obligations typical for this type of contract. Ultimate Guitar isn’t liable for damages that result from a non-material breach of any other applicable duty of care. This limitation of liability won’t apply to any statutory liability that cannot be limited, to liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or willful misconduct, or if and to exclude our responsibility for something we have specifically promised to you.

10\. INDEMNITY
--------------

You agree to defend, indemnify and hold us harmless against any losses, expenses, costs or damages (including our reasonable attorneys' fees, expert fees' and other reasonable costs of litigation or proceedings) arising from, incurred as a result of, or in any manner related to any claim or action based upon (a) your breach of, or failure to comply with, the terms and conditions of this Agreement, (b) your use of the Service, and/or (c) the use of the Service by any other person using your IDs. We may, in our discretion, participate in the defense of any such claim or action and any negotiations for its settlement or compromise. No settlement which may adversely affect our rights or obligations shall be made without our prior written approval. We reserve the right, at our own expense and on notice to you, to assume exclusive defense and control of any such claim or action and then your corresponding indemnification obligation will end.

11\. CHOICE OF LAW AND CONSENT TO JURISDICTION
----------------------------------------------

These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. If you are not a consumer in the EEA, the exclusive place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from or in connection with this agreement is San Francisco County, California, or the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and our dispute will be determined under California law. If you are a consumer in the EEA, this won’t deprive you of any protection you have under the law of the country where you live and access to the courts in that country.

12\. OBJECTIONABLE MATERIAL
---------------------------

You understand that by using the Service, you may encounter content that may be deemed offensive, indecent, or objectionable, which content may or may not be identified as having explicit language. Nevertheless, you agree to use the Service at your sole risk and that Ultimate Guitar shall have no liability to you for content that may be found to be offensive, indecent, or objectionable. Content descriptions are provided for convenience, and you acknowledge and agree that Ultimate Guitar does not guarantee their accuracy. If you're a consumer in the EEA, we don’t exclude or limit any liability for gross negligence, intent, or death or personal injury caused by our negligence or willful misconduct.

13\. LINKS TO OTHER SITES
