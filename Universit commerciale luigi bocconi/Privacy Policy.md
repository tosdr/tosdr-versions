European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
==================================================

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a regulation in EU law (2016/279) on data protection and privacy that is applicable to all the individuals within the European Union and the European Economic Area.

The GDPR was adopted on 27 April 2016 and published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 4 May 2016. It entered into force on 25 May 2016 and, after a two-year transition period, it will take effect on 25 May 2018

The new Regulation was introduced to unify all EU member states’ approaches to data regulation to simplify the regulatory environment for international business, ensuring that all the data protection laws are applied identically in every country.

More specifically, GDPR main goal is to guarantee EU citizens and residents full control over their personal data, giving them the awareness they need to feel comfortable in sharing their data

To be compliant with the GDPR, Bocconi University has adopted four different privacy policies (Prospective students, Students e _Alumni,_ Faculty & staff, Corporate and Occasional Contacts) for its submission to concerned stakeholders.
