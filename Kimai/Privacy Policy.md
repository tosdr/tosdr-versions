**Cookies**

Cookies which are necessary to allow electronic communications or to provide certain functions you wish to use (such as the shopping cart) are stored pursuant to Art. 6 paragraph 1, letter f of DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the storage of cookies to ensure an optimized service provided free of technical errors. If other cookies (such as those used to analyze your surfing behavior) are also stored, they will be treated separately in this privacy policy.

For uniform representation of fonts, this page uses web fonts provided by Google. When you open a page, your browser loads the required web fonts into your browser cache to display texts and fonts correctly. The use of Google Web fonts is done in the interest of a uniform and attractive presentation of our website. This constitutes a justified interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO.

**Hetzner Cloud**

The service runs on the Cloud of the Hetzner Online GmbH (Germany). Server location is Falkenstein, Germany.

**YouTube**

Our website displays videos from YouTube. If you visit one of our pages featuring a YouTube video, a connection to the YouTube servers is established. Here the YouTube server is informed about which of our pages you have visited. If you’re logged in to your YouTube account, YouTube allows you to associate your browsing behavior directly with your personal profile. You can prevent this by logging out of your YouTube account. This constitutes a justified interest pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO.

We use Brevo (ex. Sendinblue) to send newsletters and emails regarding our services (both for plugins and cloud). If you sign up to receive our newsletter, the data requested during the registration process (your email address) will be processed by Brevo. For this your IP address and the date of your registration will be saved along with the time. As a further part of the registration process, your consent to the sending of the newsletter will be obtained, the content will be described in concrete terms and reference made to this data protection declaration.

The newsletters sent by Brevo contain technologies by which we can analyse whether and when an email was opened and whether and which links contained in the newsletter were followed. We save this data in addition to the technical data (system data and IP address) so that the respective newsletter can be best tailored to your wishes and interests. The data thus collected is used to continuously improve the quality of our newsletters.

The legal basis for sending the newsletter and the analysis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a.) EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

**Simple Analytics**

To get critical information about the behavior of our visitors, we use Simple Analytics. This analytics software gives us insight about our visitors only in general, but not about individuals per se, as it does not track visitors and does not store any personal identifiable information.

We are using Senja to collect and display user testimonials. If you opt to leave a review, the data requested during the process will be processed by Senja. Your testimonial will be utilized as social proof, and we might display it both on the websites and on social media.
