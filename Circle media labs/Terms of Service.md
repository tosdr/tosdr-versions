You agree that it is Your responsibility to regularly check the Services for any updated Terms. By continuing to use or access any of the Services or otherwise engaging with Us after We post any changes, You accept the updated Terms.

If a revision materially alters Your rights, as determined by Circle in its sole discretion, We will use reasonable efforts to notify You in advance of the change becoming effective. In any case, the most current version of these Terms will be posted on the Services. Changes will be effective no sooner than the Last Updated date.

Circle may, at its sole discretion, offer a subscription (“Subscription”) with a free trial for a limited period (“Free Trial”). If we offer you a Free Trial, the specific terms of your Free Trial including the price of the Subscription after the Free Trial will be provided at signup and/or in the promotional materials (such as, but not limited to, emails) describing the Free Trial, and your use of the Free Trial is subject to your compliance with such specific terms.

You may cancel your Subscription within at least 24 hours prior to the end of your Free Trial by emailing us at [subscriptions@meetcircle.com](mailto:subscriptions@meetcircle.com).

At any time and without notice, we reserve the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer. 

**D. Payment.**

Our Services are generally billed on a subscription basis (“Subscription”) either accompanied by your purchase of the Device or without the purchase of the Device. You will be billed in advance for your Subscription on a recurring and periodic basis (“Billing Cycle”). The length of your Billing Cycle will depend on the Subscription you select. Billing Cycles will typically consist of one (1) month or one (1) year terms (“Subscription Term”). You agree to pay for the Subscription that you select. You also authorize us to automatically charge the payment method our service provider has on file based on the Billing Cycle applicable to your Subscription.

If You purchased the Device, Your first payment includes both the Device and a prepaid 1-year or 3-month Subscription. Once either Your prepaid Subscription ends or if You did not purchase the Device + Subscription bundle then once Your current Billing Cycle ends, Your Subscription will automatically renew for an additional Billing Cycle at the price shown in Your account dashboard or otherwise communicated to You by Us (“Renewal Price”) unless You or We cancel Your Subscription at least 1 day prior to the commencement of Your next Billing Cycle or in accordance with any return policies that apply to Your Subscription. You may also be eligible for a refund in accordance with our refund policies found [here](https://meetcircle.com/pages/faq).

For each Subscription purchased, We grant You a non-exclusive, non-transferable and non-assignable right to install and use the Circle software during Your Billing Cycle on a Device that You own or control. If You cancel or do not renew Your Subscription, then You agree to delete all copies of the software in their entirety from Your device upon the expiration of Your Billing Cycle.

Circle may change the fees and charges then in effect, or add new fees or charges, without notice. If there are any annual, monthly or similar periodic fees for Your Subscription, these fees will be billed automatically to the credit card designated during the registration process for Circle.com, a credit card subsequently designated to Circle at the start of the Billing Cycle and at the start of each renewal period, or invoiced to You, unless You terminate Your subscription before the relevant period begins. You agree to pay or have paid all fees and charges incurred in connection with Your Subscription for Circle Services (including any applicable taxes) at the rates in effect when the charges were incurred. You also are responsible for any fees or charges incurred to access the Circle Services through an Internet service provider or other third party service. All fees and charges are nonrefundable.

Payment for Circle services is due by credit card, and all credit card payments are subject to these Terms pertaining to payment for use of the Circle Services. Circle must receive payment prior to providing any Circle Services. In the event that You cancel your credit card or it is otherwise terminated, You must immediately provide Us with a new valid credit card number. You authorize Circle, from time to time, to undertake steps to determine whether the credit card number You have provided to Us is a valid credit card number. In the event that You do not provide Us with a current valid credit card number with sufficient credit, You will be in violation of these Terms, and We may terminate Your use of the Circle Services. In the event that You provide us with a debit card number instead of a credit card number, You authorize Us to make all charges described in these Terms to Your debit card account. If Your account becomes in default, You agree to pay Circle reasonable expenses, including attorney fees and costs for collection by third-party agencies, incurred by Circle.

**E. Termination.**

Circle may terminate the Circle Services at any time for any and/or no reason, including, but not limited to, Your breach of these Terms. If You terminate the Circle Services, any and all payments made by You prior to termination shall be forfeited to Circle.

* Electronic interference;  
    
* An outage affecting the data transport service;  
    
* Failure of originating or terminating access lines;

* Equipment failures relating to Your devices (e.g., Your mobile phone) or Circle’s equipment, including, hardware or software failures or misconfiguration affecting Circle, its offices, data centers, and/or any of its service providers.

Accordingly, Circle assumes no liability for or relating to the delay, failure, interruption, refusal, limitation, or corruption of any data or other information transmitted in connection with the use of the Services that are outside its reasonable control.

B. Acknowledgements. YOU AFFIRM THAT YOU HAVE READ THE FOREGOING AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT:

i. CIRCLE DOES NOT AND CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT THE CIRCLE SERVICES WILL BE CONTINUOUS OR ERROR-FREE. FOR EXAMPLE, THE CIRCLE SERVICES MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE OUTSIDE OF THE SERVICE AREA OR UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES SET FORTH ABOVE.

ii. IF YOUR MOBILE OR DATA PLAN SERVICES OR ACCESS TO THE INTERNET OR OUR CIRCLE SERVICES IS/ARE SUSPENDED, CANCELED OR TERMINATED (E.G., AS A RESULT OF BILLING ISSUES OR OTHER BREACH), YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO USE SOME OR ALL OF THE CIRCLE SERVICES.

iii. YOU ARE EXCLUSIVELY RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR USE OF THE CIRCLE SERVICES AND THE ACTIONS THAT OCCUR UNDER YOUR CIRCLE ACCOUNT. ABUSE OF THE CIRCLE SERVICES MAY SUBJECT YOU TO CIVIL AND/OR CRIMINAL FINES AND PENALTIES.

C. Modifications and Updates to the Circle Services.  

Circle reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify or discontinue offering the Circle Services, in whole or in part, including any features, functionality, tools or content thereof, at any time, for any reason or no reason, with or without notice to You.

We may from time to time develop and provide updates for the Software or Circle Devices, which may include upgrades, bug fixes, patches and other error corrections and/or new features, functionality, tools or content (collectively, “Updates”). Updates may also modify or delete features, functionality, tools or content in their entirety.

For Managed Users, depending on Your mobile device settings, when Your mobile device is connected to the internet either: (a) the Updates will automatically download and install; or (b) You may receive notice of or be prompted to download and install available Updates. We suggest that You promptly download and install all Updates. If You do not download and install the most recent Updates, portions of the Software and/or Circle Device may not properly operate. All Updates will be deemed part of the Software and Circle Devices and be subject to all terms and conditions of the Terms.

You agree that Circle has no obligation to provide any Updates or to continue to provide or enable any particular features, functionality, tools or content, and will not be liable with respect to any such modifications, Updates, discontinuance or deletions.

### VII. Communications  

A. General Communications. By accessing or using the Circle Services, or providing Personal Information to Us, You agree that We may communicate with You electronically regarding security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to Your access and/or use of the Circle Services, as well as for product releases, product updates, marketing events, and third party products or services Circle would like to communicate with You about.

B. Mobile Messaging Alerts. Our Mobile Messaging alerts (“Mobile Messaging Alerts”) allow You to receive informational alerts related to the categories You select. If You do not wish to continue receiving these Mobile Messaging Alerts, You can reply “STOP” to any mobile message from Us in order to opt out of the Mobile Messaging Alerts.

User Opt In: You must affirmatively opt into these Mobile Messaging Alerts, such as by signing up online, or by texting a keyword to Circle’s short code in response to a call-to-action. Regardless of the opt-in method You utilized to receive the Mobile Messaging Alerts, You agree that these Terms apply to Your participation in and use of the Mobile Messaging Alerts. The mobile messaging service used by Circle to communicate with You does not have the capacity to randomly or sequentially generate telephone numbers. Thus, Circle’s mobile messages are not sent to You by an automatic telephone dialing system (“ATDS” or “autodialer”). Nevertheless, by signing up to receive Mobile Messaging Alerts from Circle, You agree to receive autodialed mobile messages and You understand that consent to the Mobile Messaging Alerts is not required to make any purchase from Circle.

Cost and Frequency: Message and data rates may apply. The Mobile Messaging Alerts involve recurring mobile messages, and additional mobile messages may be sent based on Your interaction with Circle.

User Opt-Out and Additional Commands: To opt-out of receiving all mobile messages, reply “STOP” to any mobile message you received from Circle on Your mobile device. This is the easiest and preferred method to opt out of receiving mobile messages from Circle. You may receive an additional mobile message confirming your decision to opt out. The Mobile Messaging Alert system may recognize or respond to additional commands and keyword queries. Thus, You may receive additional informational text messages, even after opting out of receiving the mobile alerts. You acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding any prior opt-out attempt, You consent to receive further messages from or on behalf of Circle that result from your continued communication with the Mobile Messaging Alerts. You agree that you are subject to the Terms, including any modifications thereto then in effect, when You resubscribe to the Mobile Messaging Alerts through any of the available options to do so.

MMS: The Mobile Messaging Alerts will send SMS MTs if Your mobile device does not support MMS messaging.

Circle Warranty: Circle will not be liable for any delays or failures in the receipt of any messages connected with the Mobile Messaging Alerts. Delivery of messages is subject to effective transmission from Your wireless service provider/network operator and is outside of Circle’s control.

Participating carriers: Circle engages various SMS related service providers to provide SMSs to You. It is possible that your phone carrier is not able to receive SMSs through Circle. The list of participating carriers and any charges by them are outside of Circle’s control. No participating carrier shall be liable for delayed or undelivered messages. 

Miscellaneous: You warrant and represent that You will not provide to Circle any telephone number that is not assigned to You, and that if You obtain a new telephone number, You will promptly notify Circle that Your prior telephone number is no longer assigned to You.

Circle would like to communicate with You if We learn of a security breach, We may attempt to notify You electronically by posting a notice on the Circle Services or sending an email to You. You may have a legal right to receive this notice in writing. To receive free written notice of a security breach (or to withdraw Your consent from receiving electronic notice), please write to Us at [help@meetcircle.com](mailto:help@meetcircle.com).

**C. Monitoring of Customer Service Sessions**. We and our partners may monitor and record customer service sessions, including telephone calls and online sessions for purposes of improving customer service, internal training, and internal market research. You hereby grant us permission to monitor and record any customer service sessions involving You and/or any other users such as Managed Users that participate in the customer service sessions to use or disclose any information as necessary or appropriate to satisfy any law, regulation, or other governmental requests; to provide the Services to You or other users, and/or to enhance the types of Services We may provide in the future.

C. License to Circle. By creating, posting, or sharing Your User Content on or through the Circle Service, and subject to Circle’s Privacy Policy, You hereby grant Circle a world-wide, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, sub-licensable, royalty-free, transferable license to reproduce, distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, create derivative works of, and otherwise use, modify, and exploit Your User Content solely for the purposes of providing the Circle Services.

### X. Copyright Policy; DMCA Notices

If You have good reason to believe that another user has violated Your copyright using the Circle Service, or if You think someone incorrectly reported that You violated his or her copyright, You may notify Us by emailing Us at [help@meetcircle.com](mailto:help@meetcircle.com).

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA") provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If You believe in good faith that materials posted on the Circle Service infringe Your copyright, You (or Your agent) may send Circle a "Notification of Claimed Infringement" requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked. The notice must include the following information:

* A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the works that have been allegedly infringed;
* Identification of the copyrighted work alleged to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on the Circle Service are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works);
* Identification of the specific material alleged to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow Circle to locate the material on the Circle Service;
* Your name, address, telephone number, and email address (if available);
* A statement that You have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
* A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

If You believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against You, the DMCA permits You to send Circle a counter-notice

Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see [http://www.loc.gov/copyright](http://www.loc.gov/copyright) for details. Notices and counter-notices with respect to the Circle Service should be sent to the following address:

Circle Media Labs Inc.  
Attn: Legal  
2553 Dulles View Drive, Suite 400   
Herndon, VA 20171  

Consult Your legal advisor and see 17 U.S.C. § 512 before filing a notice or counter-notice as there are penalties for false claims under the DMCA.

### XI. Consequences of Violating These Terms

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate Your Circle Account, and/or deny access to the Circle Services, at any time and for any reason, at Our discretion. We reserve the right to refuse to provide the Circle Services to You in the future. Circle may review and remove any User Content at any time for any reason, including for activity which, in its sole judgment: violates these Terms; violates applicable laws, rules, or regulations; is abusive, disruptive, offensive or illegal; or violates the rights of, or harms or threatens the safety of, users of the Circle Services.

You are responsible for any claims, fees, fines, penalties, and other liability incurred by Us or others caused by or arising out of Your breach of these Terms and/or Your use or access of the Circle Services.

### XII. Circle’s Liability  

A. User Disputes. We are not responsible for any disputes or disagreements between You and any third party with whom You interact with by using the Circle Services. You assume all risks associated with dealing with third parties on or through the Circle Services. You agree to resolve all disputes directly with the other party, and to indemnify Circle. You release Circle from all claims, demands, and damages in disputes among users of the Circle Services, or between a user and a third party. You also agree not to involve Us in such disputes.

B. Content Accuracy and Results. We make no representations or warranties about accuracy, reliability, completeness, or timeliness of any content accessed using the Circle Services. Similarly, We make no representations about the accuracy, reliability, completeness, or timeliness of any data from a third party service provider or the quality or nature of third party products or services obtained or discovered through the Circle Services. We make no promises and disclaim all liability of specific results or outcomes from the use of the Circle Service. You use the Circle Services at Your own risk.

C. Third-Party Websites. The Circle Services may include links to third party websites and applications. You are responsible for evaluating whether You want to access or use them. We are not responsible for and do not endorse any features, content, advertising, products, or other materials on other websites or applications. You acknowledge sole responsibility for and assume all risk, and We disclaim all liability arising from Your access or use of them, including, without limitation, any and all content, applications, products or services available on or through such websites or applications, and We will not be responsible for any damage or harm relating thereto.

D. Content Blocking Not Guaranteed. “False positive” content blocking may occur from time to time or at any time. Circle strives to allow sufficiently granular control of content filters to allow educational or meritorious content through, if that is the intent of the user. However, there is no guarantee that some content that You would deem acceptable will not be blocked by the Circle Services, and that content You deem unacceptable or inappropriate or in violation of these Terms will be blocked. In the event that You believe Circle is miscategorizing a site or service, please contact Circle support at help@meetcircle.com to submit the issue for review.

E. Warranties by Users. You represent and warrant to Circle that:  

i. You have the power and authority to accept and agree to the Terms;  

ii. You own or control all of the rights necessary to grant the rights and licenses granted herein;  

iii. that You have requested and received the consent of all individuals and/or otherwise have the necessary authority for whom You have submitted contact information to include them in the Circle Services, including to share their telephone number and/or email address with Circle;

iv. You will not violate any federal, state or local laws, rules or regulations or infringe the rights of any third party, including, any intellectual property, privacy or publicity-related rights, in connection with Your User Content or otherwise in connection with Your access to or use of the Services or Circle Device;

v. the exercise by Circle of the rights granted by You hereunder will not cause Circle to violate any applicable laws, rules or regulations, to infringe the rights of any third party; and

vi. all account information provided by You will be complete, accurate and up-to-date when provided, and updated as necessary to ensure that it remains complete, accurate and up-to-date.

F. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES  

YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT: YOUR ACCESS AND/OR USE OF THE CIRCLE SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK; THE CIRCLE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS; THE RELEASED PARTIES (AS DEFINED BELOW) EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES AS TO PRODUCTS OR SERVICES OFFERED BY BUSINESSES LISTED ON THE CIRCLE SERVICES, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

ANY MATERIAL DOWNLOADED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED THROUGH THE ACCESS OR USE OF THE CIRCLE SERVICES IS ACCESSED AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR MOBILE DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE DOWNLOAD OR USE OF ANY SUCH MATERIAL.

YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT THE RELEASED PARTIES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY LOSS OR DAMAGES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES OR PERSONAL INJURY OR DEATH (EVEN IF CIRCLE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), RESULTING FROM: (I) THE ACCESS, USE OR THE INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE CIRCLE SERVICES; (II) THE COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS AND SERVICES RESULTING FROM ANY GOODS, DATA, INFORMATION OR SERVICES OBTAINED OR MESSAGES RECEIVED OR TRANSACTIONS ENTERED INTO THROUGH, FROM, OR AS A RESULT OF THE CIRCLE SERVICE; (III) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR DATA OR CIRCLE ACCOUNT; (IV) STATEMENTS OR CONDUCT OF ANY USER OR THIRD PARTY ON THE CIRCLE SERVICE; (V) YOUR RELIANCE ON CONTENT MADE AVAILABLE BY US; OR (VI) ANY OTHER MATTER RELATING TO THE CIRCLE SERVICE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS IN THIS PARAGRAPH MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT POSSIBLE BY LAW, THE RELEASED PARTIES’ MAXIMUM LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE CIRCLE SERVICE OR YOUR USE OF CIRCLE CONTENT, REGARDLESS OF THE CAUSE OF ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, OR OTHERWISE), WILL NOT EXCEED THE RETAIL COST PAID FOR THE CIRCLE DEVICE THROUGH WHICH THE USER PRINCIPALLY ACCESSES THE SERVICES OR, IF NONE, THE COSTS OF THE APP ON THE APP STORE. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SET FORTH ABOVE ARE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN CIRCLE AND YOU, AND WILL SURVIVE AND APPLY EVEN IF YOUR REMEDIES ARE FOUND OR ALLEGED TO HAVE FAILED OF THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

You and Circle agree to submit to the personal and exclusive arbitration of any disputes relating to Your access or use of the Circle Service under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association(“AAA”), and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitration shall take place in Herndon, Virginia before a single neutral arbitrator appointed in accordance with the AAA Rules and shall be conducted in the English language. All arbitrations shall be conducted and resolved on an individual basis and not a class-wide, multiple plaintiff or similar basis. No arbitration shall be consolidated with any other arbitration proceeding involving any other person or entity. YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST CIRCLE ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND HEREBY WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW. FURTHER, UNLESS BOTH YOU AND CIRCLE OTHERWISE AGREE IN WRITING, THE COURT MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. You acknowledge and understand that, with respect to any dispute with the Released Parties arising out of or relating to Your use of the Circle Service or these Terms:

* YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO HAVE A TRIAL BY JURY;

* YOU MUST FILE ANY CLAIM WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER SUCH CLAIM AROSE OR IT IS FOREVER BARRED.

Any amendment to this section (other than an amendment to any notice address or site link provided herein) in the future, shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against Us prior to the effective date of the amendment. However, the amendment will apply to all other disputes or claims governed by this section that have arisen or may arise between You and Circle after the effective date of the amendment. We will notify You of amendments to this section by posting the amended Terms on [www.meetcircle.com](https://www.meetcircle.com/).

You agree that in the event of a dispute that is not subject to this Arbitration section in these Terms, or if this Arbitration Agreement is found to be unenforceable any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating in any way to these Terms or your use of the Services, except any claim properly lodged in a Small Claims Court of the United States, will be filed only in the state or federal courts located in the Herndon, Virginia, and you hereby consent and submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of such courts to litigate any such action.

You may grant approvals, permission, extensions, and consents by email. Notices to You may be sent to the email address associated with Your account for the Services. You consent to receive certain electronic communications from Us in connection with Your use of the Services.

For notices made by e-mail, the date on which such notice is transmitted will be deemed the date of receipt.

F. Waiver. Our failure to exercise any right or enforce any obligation under these Terms of Use or to take action with respect to a breach by You or others will not constitute a waiver of such right, obligation or breach.

In addition, no waiver granted in any instance shall constitute a waiver in any other instance.

G. Remedies. Except as expressly set forth in the Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under the Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies available under contract, at law, in equity or otherwise.

H. Severability. Except as otherwise provided in the Terms, if an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of the Terms to be invalid, void or unenforceable, in whole or in part, for any reason, the offending provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions, which will remain in full force and effect.
