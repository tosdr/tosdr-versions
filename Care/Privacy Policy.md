-----------------------------------------------

How we collect and store information depends on the Services you use and the activities in which you participate. You can use some of the Site and Services without providing any information other than that automatically collected as described below. Visitors who access and browse the Site without registering are “Site Visitors.” In order to utilize some of the Services offered by Care.com, you must register with Care.com. All users who register with Care.com are “Registered Users.”

Regardless of whether you are a Site Visitor, Registered User, or otherwise access or use the Services, all information that you provide to us when registering, posting a job, posting a profile, communicating through the Site, discussing care options over the phone, utilizing our mobile applications or that you otherwise provide on the Site or by phone, email, postal mail or otherwise, will be stored by us and processed in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You represent and warrant to us that you have the right and authority to provide us all information you provide about yourself or others. 

You may provide us with information in various ways, including:

Some users may have the opportunity to register with Care.com by connecting through Facebook’s application programming interface (API) or other third-party authentication tools such as those provided by Google or Apple. Please see below to learn about the information we access, collect and store if you register with Care.com through one of these methods. If you register for a Service that requires you to pay a fee, you understand and agree that Care.com or its designated payments processor will  collect your payment method details, such as account number, expiration date, security code and  billing address.

* pictures you choose to provide
* health information, if you choose to provide it
* any other information you choose to include in your job posting

**iii. When posting a profile**

If you are a Care Provider, we collect and store all of the additional information that you provide to us in your profile. This may include, among other information:

In some cases, Site Visitors may have the ability to provide us information through the Site, such as contact information. In addition, both Registered Users and Site Visitors may choose to provide information by phone, email, postal mail, or chat. We collect and store all of the information you provide us through these channels. Moreover, if you provide information about someone other than yourself through any of these channels, you represent that you have authority to do so.

### **B. Information provided by others**

**i. By Site Visitors, Registered Users and others**

Additionally, certain Registered Users may post reviews about individual Care Providers. Care.com may also obtain and post audio recordings of Care Provider references, which may also be accessed from the Site. In addition, certain Registered Users may communicate directly with one another through Care.com platforms.

**ii. By third parties to verify your information and representations**

In order for Care.com or our service provider to verify your identity when you are on a mobile device using the Care.com mobile application or on mobile web, your mobile service provider may share your phone number and other account information to validate mobile possession. You authorize us to receive this information from your wireless carrier to help us identify you or your wireless device and to prevent fraud.

In order to promote the safety and integrity of the Site and Services, you authorize Care.com, as provided in the Terms of Use, to utilize third party verification providers to check your information on an ongoing basis against a variety of sources, which may include, but are not limited to, national criminal databases, sex offender registries, certain media streams, terrorist watch lists, criminal and fugitive watch lists, fraud watch lists, law enforcement reports, and other data to assist us in verifying the information you provide us (such as your name, address, email address, etc.) and the representations and warranties you make in the Terms of Use and on the Site (such as representations regarding your criminal background) (“Preliminary Screens”). The results of any Preliminary Screens will be made available to Care.com.

**iii. By third parties that perform background checks**

As provided in the Terms of Use, we may provide some or all Registered Users and Site Visitors with the ability to request from a third-party consumer reporting agency that a background check be run on themselves or on Care Providers they are considering hiring using information that they and any subject Care Providers may provide. Any such background checks will be subject to the terms we establish for such checks on the Site pages where they are requested or authorized, the terms of this Privacy Policy, and our Terms of Use. Care.com may receive a copy of, or otherwise have access to, any such background check, unless otherwise specified in this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Use.

You may have the opportunity to connect to Care.com using your credentials from other services’ authentication tools, such as those provided by Facebook, Google, or Apple when you register for Care.com or after you have registered for Care.com. If you connect to Care.com through these methods, either when you register or after you have registered, we will collect, store, and use in accordance with this Privacy Policy any and all information you agreed that these entities could provide to Care.com through their authentication tool. Your agreement (and our access to your information) takes place when you instruct, accept or allow these entities to register you for a Care.com account or otherwise connect to Care.com through them. The information Care.com may access, collect and store may include the following, among other information, as allowed by you, the relevant terms of the authentication tool provider, and your privacy settings with these entities:

**vi. By other sources**

In addition, we may obtain information about you from other sources (e.g., partners, researchers, marketers, etc.), such as demographic data, and other information to enable us to comply with regulatory requirements, ensure the accuracy of data, better understand your likely interests, prevent fraud, etc. We may combine information that we collect from you with information about you from such other sources and use it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

**vii. By your employer**

If you have access to the Site and Services as part of your employer’s benefits program, your employer may provide information about you to Care.com. Any such information will be subject to an agreement between Care.com and your employer and will not be subject to this Privacy Policy. 

### **C. Information you expressly authorize us to collect**

We may from time to time request permission to collect certain information from or about you. For example, if you use a Care.com mobile application, we may request permission to access information about the contacts listed in your mobile device phone book when you initiate an address book search for friends who have downloaded the application. We may also request permission to access and store your location (e.g., your precise GPS-based functionality on the mobile devices used to access the Site and Services) to provide functionality relevant to your location. If you grant your permission, we will access and/or store such information unless you subsequently opt out by adjusting the settings in your mobile device. See your device manufacturer’s instructions for further details.

### **D. Automatically collected information**

We may automatically collect certain information about the computer or devices (including mobile devices) you use to access the Site and Services as described in this section below.

**i. Log files, IP addresses and information about your computer and mobile device**

When you visit the Site, Care.com receives the internet protocol (“IP”) address of your computer (or the proxy server you use to access the internet), your computer operating system, the type of web browser you are using, and browser language. If you are using a mobile device, Care.com may also receive unique device identifiers and other information about your mobile or other device(s), and mobile operating system. We may correlate this information with other information we have about you. We may also automatically collect information related to the ways in which you interact with the Site and the Services, such as referring and exit pages, URLs, platform type, the number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages and content viewed (including ads viewed) and the order of such views, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time you use the Services, error logs, and other similar information.

**ii. Cookies, Tracking Pixels, and other technologies**

A cookie is a tiny data file that resides on your computer, mobile phone, or other device, and allows us to recognize you when you return to the Site using the same computer (or mobile device) and web browser. Like most websites, we and our service providers, as well as ouronline analytics and marketing partners use cookies, and tracking pixels to track Site usage and trends, evaluate the effectiveness of our ads both on and off our Site, customize your experience on the Site and improve the quality of our Services. For example, using these technologies we can determine, among other things, which pages of our Site you visit and which ads you click on. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can modify your browser settings to decline cookies. In some cases, however, doing so may impact your ability to use Care.com. 

**iii. Online analytics and advertising**

When you visit our Site or open one of our emails, we may allow authorized third parties, such as ad servers, ad agencies, ad exchanges, ad technology vendors, and research firms, to place or recognize a unique cookie, pixel, and/or similar technologies on your browser in order to provide you relevant Care.com advertisements as you surf the Internet. These advertisements may be targeted to you based on information these authorized third parties know or infer about you and include in the cookies placed on your browser, and/or on information about your Internet browsing activities, including your browsing activities on our site, gathered through your browser over time. If you prefer not to receive these online behavioral advertisements, you may opt-out [here](https://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp) or [here](https://www.aboutads.info/choices/). In order for the opt-out to work, your browser must be set to accept third party cookies. Furthermore, if you buy a new computer or mobile device, change web browsers or delete the opt-out cookie, you will need to perform the opt-out task again. Please note that if you opt-out you may continue to receive Care.com advertisements as you surf the Internet, including contextual ads based on the content on a webpage you are visiting. However, these advertisements will not be displayed based on information contained in, or collected by, cookies or other technologies placed on your browser when you visit our Site or open our emails.

We also use Google Analytics to measure Site usage and improve our visitor experience. The relevant data is provided to us by Google in the aggregate (i.e., individual users are not identified) and allows us to better understand our Site audience. The Google Analytics features implemented by us allow us (i) to evaluate and generate reports on certain demographic, behavioral, and interest metrics of users collected by Google, and (ii) to create advertising remarketing audiences and campaigns based on such metrics, which may be segmented into aggregated groups. Visitors can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads using the Ads Settings form at [https://www.google.com/settings/ads](https://www.google.com/settings/ads). 

Depending on your state of residence and applicable laws, you may also have the ability to manage these technologies through a consent management tool on the Site and Services available via the “Your Privacy Choices” or “Do Not Sell or Share My Information” link on the Site footer.   See the “Your Privacy Rights and Choices” section below for more information about how you can manage these technologies.

**iv. Social media features and widgets**

Our Site includes social media features and widgets, such as the Facebook “Like” button and the Facebook “Share” button. These features may collect your IP address, the URL of the page you are visiting on our Site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

**2. Purposes For Which We Use Information**
--------------------------------------------

In general, the information we collect is used for our business purposes: (1) to improve our Services and enhance your experience with Care.com, (2) to enable us to provide a safer community for all of our Registered Users, and (3) to help us communicate with you.

3. contact you in response to questions and solicit feedback and input from you;
4. notify you about new features of the Services, special events, or products, services, and special offers, or other information that we believe will be of interest to you via direct mail to your address on file, email, SMS messages, or other media or networks;
5. administer sweepstakes and contests;

**3. How We Disclose Information and Categories of Third Parties With Whom We Disclose Information**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to using the information collected by Care.com for the purposes described above, we may also disclose your information to various third parties, as described below. Please review our disclosure policy closely. By using our Site or our Services, you agree that we can disclose the information you provide to us in the ways described below. Your ability to make changes to what information is disclosed is described below.

### **A. With All Site Visitors and Registered Users**

If you are a Care Seeker or a Care Provider, in order to increase your chances of finding a job or finding the care you need, we disclose to Site Visitors and Registered Users the information that is included in your job posting or profile, aside from your contact information, as well as the following registration information, which we may include in your job posting or profile: your first name, first initial of your last name, city, state, profile picture, and if you are a Care Provider, your gender and, unless you opt-out, your age. With certain exceptions, you choose how much detail you want to include in either your job posting or your profile. We may also disclose on your profile or job posting any company reviews you have posted on our Site, whether you have connected to Care.com through Facebook, and any connections you have with other Care.com users, including the nature of those connections. If you are a Care Provider and have elected to verify certain information with Care.com or to have a background check performed, we may also disclose that information in your profile as a Registered User in addition to your response rate and any payment or payroll preferences you have indicated. If you post information in a Care.com online group forum, such as the Working Moms Group, that information may be viewed by any Site Visitor or Registered User who accesses the forum. We may display personal testimonials of Registered Users and other endorsements on our Site or in other marketing materials. These testimonials or endorsements may include information such as the Registered User’s first name, first initial of last name, town and state. With a Registered User’s consent, we may include their full name.

### **B. With other Registered Users and corporate providers**

In addition to the information that is provided to all Registered Users and Site Visitors, Care Provider reviews and references are made available to certain Registered Users. If you are a Care Provider, your phone number may be visible to certain Registered Users if you elect to share it in your profile. In addition, your approximate residential location (through Google map plotting) is made available to certain Registered Users and Site Visitors unless you elect to keep that information confidential. 

If you are a Care Seeker or a Care Provider, you will appear in search result listings if you match the search criteria used by a Care Provider or Care Seeker, as applicable. Similarly, you may appear in emails sent to Care Providers or Care Seekers in your area. Care Seekers may opt-out of being included in Care Provider search results and in certain emails sent to Care Providers. In addition, if you are a Care Seeker and you view the profile of certain Care Providers, those Care Providers will be able to see that you have viewed their profiles unless you opt-out of that information disclosure. If you are a Registered User, your Care.com online status may be made available to other Registered Users unless you elect to keep that information confidential. If you connect to Care.com through Facebook, we may allow any of your Facebook friends who have connected to Care.com through Facebook to see that you are a Registered User. In addition, other Registered Users who have connected to Care.com through Facebook will be able to see if you are friends with any of their Facebook friends or if you share certain affinities or interests with them. If you fill out a form to request information from a specific corporate Care Provider, such as a specific day care or tutoring center, the contact information you submit on a form for the provider will be forwarded to that provider. Similarly, if you call a corporate Care Provider directly or click to a corporate Care Provider’s site from the Care.com site, any information you provide over the phone or on the provider’s site will be provided by you directly to the provider. In addition, if you utilize our Backup Care Services or the Senior Care Planning Services to obtain information about senior care or other care options for yourself or your loved ones, information you provide Care.com, including contact, health, financial, and other information about yourself or your loved ones may be forwarded to third party Backup Care Providers or Senior Care Services providers that may meet your stated needs and preferences so they may evaluate your needs and preferences and contact you. If you provide information about someone other than yourself, you represent that you have authority to provide us the information and to authorize us to disclose the information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. Once provided to a corporate Care Provider, the information is subject to the privacy policies of the corporate Care Provider. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a corporate Care Provider may provide information about you and your dependents who are receiving their services, including contact information, utilization information, and medical and health-related information, to Care.com and our subsidiary, Care Concierge, Inc. Such provided information would be subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy. **If we terminate your registration for any reason, we reserve the right to send a notice of your termination to other Registered Users with whom we believe you have corresponded.**

### **C. With service providers or processors**

We also disclose information to service providers or processors (collectively referred to herein as “processors”) with whom we have a contractual relationship and who perform services for Care.com including, without limitation, processors who: provide email, demographic information, or geo-location information services; perform background or identity checks or Preliminary Screens; process or accept credit card payments; run classified advertising businesses; send SMS messages to Registered Users’ mobile phone numbers; provide services that enable us and other third parties to detect and prevent fraud; in each case to the extent applicable. In certain cases (such as for processors who help facilitate our online communication services or provide fraud detection and prevention services), the information we disclose may include the contents of written and audio messages you send through our online communication platforms. We have implemented Google’s Invisible reCAPTCHA technology on our site. Use of the Invisible reCAPTCHA is subject to the [Google Privacy Policy](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/) and [Terms of Use](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/).

### **D. With listings in and through Google and other public search engines, social media sites (e.g. Facebook, Google+), and on other third party websites)**

In an effort to further facilitate the ability of Care Seekers or Care Providers to find a caregiver or job, selected information contained in Care Seeker job postings and Care Provider profiles, which may include photo, first name, first initial of last name, city, state, and job/provider description, may also be disclosed to third party search engines, social media sites, and other third party websites or vendors who run classified advertising and other businesses, and thus may be listed in third party web site search results and on third party websites, which would make that information available to the public and allow them to link to your Care.com posting. Registered Users can opt-out of this disclosure by adjusting their [account settings](https://www.care.com/account-preferences-p1016.html). If you post information in a Care.com online group forum, such as the Working Moms Group, your content, including your name as the contributor, may be displayed in third party search engine results and available to the public.

### **E. With third-party tool providers if you connect to Care.com through these tools.**

Depending on the sensitivity of the information you are requesting and the type of request you are making, this may include verifying your name and email address. If we cannot verify your identity, we may be unable to respond to your requests.  As provided in applicable law, you also have the right to not be discriminated against for exercising your rights. 

If you would like to exercise any of the rights set out in this section, please contact us using the information in the “Contact Us” section below. You may be able to designate an authorized agent to make requests on your behalf. For us to verify an authorized agent, you must provide the authorized agent with signed, written permission to make such requests or a power of attorney.

As explained above, we may disclose personal information to third-party advertising providers for targeted advertising purposes or use related analytics partners to help us analyze use of our Services and our user/customer base. Under applicable law, the disclosure of your personal information to these third parties may be considered a “sale” of personal information or the processing of personal information for “targeted advertising” purposes.  To opt out of these disclosures, you can use the “Your Privacy Choices” or “Do Not Sell or Share My Information” link on our Site footer.  Note that you will need to opt out on each device you use to access the Services.

Care.com may also retain and use your information if necessary to provide the Services to other Registered Users. For example, just as an email you may send to another person through an email provider resides in that person’s inbox even after you delete it from your sent files or close your account, emails you send through Care.com to other Users, as well as your contributions to Care.com groups, may remain visible to others after you have closed your account.

**California Privacy Rights**

California residents may make certain requests about their personal information under the CCPA as set forth in “Your Rights and Choices” section above. 

In addition, if we offer any financial incentives in exchange for your personal information, we will provide you with appropriate information about such incentives.

Right to Opt Out of “Sale” or “Sharing” of Personal Information. The CCPA requires that we describe certain disclosures of personal information where we receive valuable consideration. California law treats such disclosures as “sales” even if no money is exchanged. The CCPA also requires us to disclose how we “share” personal information, i.e., how we disclose personal information for purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising (also called targeted advertising). Such activities are described more in the Policy above.

To opt out of our use of your personal information through cookies and similar technologies for purposes that are considered “sales” or “sharing,” you can use the “Your Privacy Choices” or “Do Not Sell or Share My Information” link on our Site footer. If you have a legally recognized browser-based opt out preference signal turned on through your browser, we recognize the preference expressed by this signal in accordance with applicable law.  

We do not knowingly sell the personal information of minors under 16 years of age.

**Do Not Track Notice.** Some browsers used to access the Internet may give you the option through “Do Not Track” settings associated with such browsers to request that a website operator not track your information across its website or other websites. We engage in such tracking in order to optimize and/or customize our Services, detect and respond to allegations of fraud, and to otherwise ensure the safety of our Registered Users and Site Visitors. While we do not currently honor such browser requests, we will not use your information in a manner that violates this Privacy Policy.  Please note that Do Not Track is a different mechanism than the “Global Privacy Control” discussed immediately above, which we do honor.

**Shine the Light.** California Law allows customers who are California residents to request certain information once per year regarding our disclosure of “personal information” (as that term is defined under applicable California law) to third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes.
