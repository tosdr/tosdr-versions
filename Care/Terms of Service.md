-------------------------------------------------------------------

**1.1 About Our Services**

Care.com offers various Services to help its users find, coordinate, and maintain quality care. The Services we offer include, among others:

* We provide a platform for individuals seeking care services (such as individual or shared child care, senior care, special needs, pet care, tutoring and housekeeping services) and corporate care providers seeking to hire individual care providers (such as child centers, in-home care agencies, and senior living facilities) (each “Care Seekers”) to post jobs on the Site, and to search for, narrow, find, and communicate with individuals and entities who provide care services (“Care Providers”), and for Care Providers to post profiles on the Site and browse, search, and apply to jobs. We also provide functionality that allows Care Seekers to search for and message other Care Seekers to help facilitate shared child care services.
* We provide tools and information to help Care Seekers and Care Providers make more informed decisions, such as (i) our Safety Center at [https://www.care.com/safety-center-p1273.html](https://www.care.com/safety-center-p1273.html) which includes a safety guide and safety resources, (ii) verification dashboards on Care Provider profiles, which enable Care Seekers to check the status of a Care Provider’s various verifications, and (iii) a process for Care Seekers to obtain background check reports from third-party consumer reporting agencies on individual Care Providers who consent to the running and sharing of those reports.
* We provide a directory of entity Care Providers that operate care-related businesses such as child care centers, family child care centers, nanny agencies, au pairs agencies, summer camps, tutoring centers, in-home care agencies, senior care housing companies and housekeepers from which users may contact or request information.
* For certain Care Seekers who enroll in Care.com through their employer’s benefits program and for certain other Care Seekers, we offer through our subsidiaries LifeCare, Inc., Care Concierge, Inc. and Town and Country Resources, certain additional services, which are described in Additional Terms that are specific to those services.
* We provide an online community for Registered Users to communicate and share information with other Registered Users who share a common interest or bond.
* We offer through Stripe, Inc., (“Stripe”), a third party, a service that facilitates the payment of Care Providers by Care Seekers via credit card or debit card. These payment processing services are provided by Stripe and are subject to the [Stripe Connected Account Agreement](https://stripe.com/connect/account-terms), which includes the [Stripe Terms of Service](https://stripe.com/terms) (collectively, the “Stripe Services Agreement”). By agreeing to these Terms, Care Providers that use the payment service also agree to be bound by the Stripe Services Agreement, as the same may be modified by Stripe from time to time. As a condition of Care.com enabling payment processing services through Stripe, you agree to provide Care.com accurate and complete information about you, and you authorize Care.com to share it and transaction information related to your use of the payment processing services provided by Stripe. Care.com assumes no liability or responsibility for any payments you may make through this service, and all such payments are non-refundable. Care Providers who receive payments from Care Seekers through this service may also qualify for certain benefits under one or more programs that Care.com may offer from time to time.
* We offer eligible Care Providers access to various benefits from third party service providers, including, without limitation, those that offer access to health insurance, and other benefits.
* We offer, as part of the functionality contained in one or more of our mobile applications, the ability for Care Seekers and Care Providers to exchange information and conduct interviews via live video streams. This feature is powered by technology (the “OpenTok Platform”) licensed to us by TokBox, Inc., a third party independent of Care.com. Care Seekers and Care Providers shall not be deemed to have any contractual relationship with Tokbox, Inc. under these Terms of Use, and shall not be deemed to constitute third party beneficiaries under any agreement between Care.com and TokBox, Inc. Care.com shall be solely responsible for providing any customer service, if any, to Care Seekers or Care Providers that elect to use the OpenTok Platform. 

Our Services continue to grow and change. Please refer to our Site for further information about the Services we provide.

**1.2 Limitations of our Services**

We offer Services to help our users find, coordinate, and maintain care for their families. However, except where specifically provided in these Terms, in any applicable Additional Terms, or on the Site itself,

* **Except for Backup Care Providers employed by our subsidiaries, we do not employ any Care Providers and are not responsible for the conduct, whether online or offline, of any Care Seeker, Care Provider, or other user of the Site or Services.** Care Seekers are responsible for compliance with all applicable employment and other laws in connection with any employment relationship they establish (such as applicable Ban-the-Box, Fair Chance, payroll, tax and minimum wage laws).
* **Care Seeker and Care Provider content is primarily user generated. We do not control or vet user-generated content for accuracy, and we do not assume and expressly disclaim any responsibility for the accuracy or reliability of any information provided by Care Providers or Care Seekers on or off the Site. We do not assume and expressly disclaim any liability that may result from the use of information provided on our Site.**
* **We do not refer or recommend Care Seekers or Care Providers nor do we make any representations about the suitability, reliability, timeliness, or accuracy of the services provided by Care Providers or the integrity, responsibility or actions of Care Seekers or Care Providers whether in public, private or offline interactions. Any screening of a Care Seeker or Care Provider and his, her or its information by Care.com is limited and should not be taken as complete, accurate, up-to-date or conclusive of the individual’s or entity’s suitability as an employer or care provider.**
* We are not an employment agency, and we do not secure or procure employees for any Care Seekers, nor do we secure or procure opportunities for employment for any Care Providers.
* We do not control, monitor, supervise, or oversee the quality, timing, hours, pay, legality, or any other aspect of services delivered by Care Providers, nor do we require Care Providers to accept or work any jobs or deliver any services at all.
* We do not provide any medical, diagnostic, treatment or clinical service or engage in any conduct that requires a professional license.
* We may offer certain Registered Users the opportunity to verify certain information such as their email address, cell phone number, or, in the case of child care centers, their state license information. If we indicate that certain information has been verified, it means that the user has complied with the process we have established for verifying such information. However, we do not guarantee, nor do we represent or warrant, that the information is accurate or that it belongs to the Registered User who supplied it. 

**Please review carefully the Release of Liability Form Third-Party Content and Conduct that appears in Section 9 below for important limitations on Care.com’s liability to which you are agreeing by using the Site and Services.** 

**1.3 User Responsibilities**

**Registered Users are solely responsible for interviewing, vetting, performing background and reference checks on, verifying information provided by, and selecting an appropriate Care Seeker or Care Provider for themselves or their family. The only exception is when a third party we or one of our subsidiaries contracts with to provide services in support of the Backup Care Service selects on behalf of the Registered User the specific individual Backup Care Provider from the agency who will provide backup or senior care services. In that limited circumstance only, the agency (as opposed to the Registered User) is responsible for screening the Backup Care Provider it selects on behalf of the Registered User.** 

**Please visit our** [**Safety Center**](https://www.care.com/safety-center-p1273.html) **at** [**www.care.com/safety-center-p1273.html**](https://www.care.com/safety-center-p1273.html) **for recommendations on how to make more informed hiring and employment decisions, as well as for tips if you are a Care Seeker looking to find another Care Seeker with whom to share child care services in your area.

Further, in order to protect the integrity of the Site and the Services, Care.com reserves the right at any time in its sole discretion to block users from certain IP addresses from accessing the Site.

**4. Background and Verification Checks**
-----------------------------------------

**4.1 Care Providers Can Order or Authorize Background Checks about Themselves and Can Authorize the Sharing of Them with Other Members** 

Care.com offers to individuals who have registered as Care Providers and Care Seekers one or more background check services from third-party consumer reporting agencies (“Background Checks”). Certain background checks may be made available for purchase by both Care Seekers and Care Providers, while others may only be made only be available for purchase by Care Seekers or Care Providers. All background checks require payment of a separate fee by the Member who is initiating the background check request and are subject to the consent of the Care Provider on whom the check is being performed.  A paid membership subscription may be required to access one or more background check options.

Each of these Background Checks is regulated by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”), and the background reports resulting from these services are considered “consumer reports” under FCRA. Consumer reports may contain information on your character, general reputation, personal characteristics, and mode of living, including but not limited to consumer credit, criminal history, workers’ compensation, driving, employment, military, civil, and educational data and reports.

Care.com will receive a copy of each Background Check you order or authorize through Care.com. See Section 4.4 below for information regarding Care.com’s use of these Background Checks. You are responsible for making sure that the email address you provide to Care.com is correct, knowing that sensitive information will be sent to it.

**If you are a Care Provider and you authorize a third-party background check ordered by a Care Seeker, the results of that background check will be made available to the Care Seeker who ordered it, regardless of its contents.** 

If you are a Care Provider and you have ordered a Background Check on yourself from a third-party consumer reporting agency through Care.com, we may indicate in your profile that you have completed that check. However, we will not share the results with any other site visitor or Registered User without your specific authorization.

**4.2 Background Check Offerings Available to Individuals Who May Not Have Registered As Care Providers or Care Seekers** 

Through certain portions of the Site, we may from time to time offer to individuals who may or may not be registered as Care Seekers the opportunity to purchase certain background checks on caregivers who are not necessarily registered on Care.com. These background checks are performed by a third-party consumer reporting agency and are subject to the terms of Section 4.1, 4.3, and 4.7 except that (i) references to Care Seekers shall refer to individuals who order the checks regardless of whether they are registered as Care Seekers, (ii) references to Care Providers shall refer to individuals who authorize the check to be performed on themselves regardless of whether they are registered as Care Providers, and (iii) Care.com does not view the results of these checks regardless of whether the caregiver on whom the check is performed is registered as a Care Provider.

**4.3 Special Responsibilities of Users of Background Check under FCRA** 

The use of any background check reports obtained through the Site is governed by the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”) and certain state laws. If you order or request access to background check on a Care Seeker, you are considered an end user of the check, and must agree to a required End User Certification before the check will be processed. This End User Certification requires you to certify that you will comply with the FCRA and any applicable state laws, and summarizes key legal obligations. A summary of your responsibilities in using the information contained the background check can be found [https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/using-consumer-reports-what-employers-need-know](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/using-consumer-reports-what-employers-need-know). If there is negative data in a check you receive, and you choose to take “adverse action” (i.e. if you choose to pass on that individual’s candidacy) on the basis of this negative data, you must agree to take certain procedural steps, which can be found at [https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/using-consumer-reports-what-employers-need-know](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/using-consumer-reports-what-employers-need-know). These include notifying the individual who is the subject of the report of your decision to take adverse action based on information contained in the report and the subject’s right to contest the accuracy or completeness of the report. Depending on the specific background check you order, Care.com may provide a mechanism for you to request that the consumer reporting agency who performed the check complete these steps on your behalf. Where such a mechanism is not available, you are responsible for making any required notifications yourself. If the subject contests the report with the consumer reporting agency, you are required to suspend the hiring process while the agency researches the accuracy and completeness of the report.

**4.4 Care.com May Review and Use Background Checks You Order or Authorize About Yourself** 

**By registering for and using the Site or Services as an individual Care Provider, and subject to your authorization, you acknowledge and agree that Care.com may review and use any Background Checks you have ordered or authorized about yourself for the purpose of protecting the safety and integrity of our Site and its users, which may, in the case of certain Care Providers, be considered an employment purpose pursuant to the FCRA. Care.com reserves the right to terminate your account based on the information contained in such report, even if such information was subsequently dismissed.** 

If Care.com terminates your account or access to the Site on the basis of information in a Background Check, we will notify you and provide you the name and contact information of the consumer reporting agency that created the report. We will also provide you a copy of the report unless the consumer reporting agency has already provided you a copy or access to it. You hereby represent, understand and expressly agree that Care.com does not have control over or assume any responsibility for the quality, accuracy, or reliability of the information included in these Background Checks. Furthermore, any inaccuracies in the report must be addressed with the consumer reporting agency that issued it and not Care.com.

**4.5 Care.com May Order and Use Background Screenings About You**

By registering for and using the Site or Services as a Care Seeker or Care Provider, you hereby acknowledge and agree that Care.com has the right, but not the obligation, to use a third-party consumer reporting agency on an ongoing basis to use your personal information to run periodic background screenings on you for the purpose of protecting the safety and integrity of our Site and its users (“Preliminary Screens”), which may, in the case of certain Care Providers, be deemed to be an employment purpose under the FCRA. Subject to certain additional disclosures and authorizations, if applicable to you as a Care Provider, Care.com may order these screenings when you register with Care.com and thereafter in connection with your continued use of our Services and/or interaction with our Site (such as by contacting or communicating with other users, posting or updating a job or profile, ordering or authorizing a Background Check, etc.).

These Preliminary Screens may also regulated by FCRA, and the background reports resulting from these services may be considered “consumer reports” under FCRA.

You understand and agree that Care.com may review the information provided by the third-party consumer reporting agency and that Care.com retains the right to terminate your Care.com registration based on the information it receives from these checks, even if such information was subsequently changed or corrected. If Care.com terminates your account or access to the Site on the basis of information in a background report, we will notify you and provide you the name and contact information of the consumer reporting agency that created the report. We will also provide you access to a copy of the report unless the consumer reporting agency has already provided you a copy or access to it. You hereby represent, understand and expressly agree that Care.com does not have control over or assume any responsibility for the quality, accuracy, or reliability of the information included in these checks. Furthermore, any inaccuracies in the report must be addressed with the consumer reporting agency that issued it (and not Care.com) within the time period specified in your notice. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Care.com is under no obligation to reinstate any accounts it may have terminated even if the information that led to the termination is subsequently changed or corrected.

**BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS AND USING OUR SITE AND/OR SERVICES, AND, IF APPLICABLE TO YOU AS A CARE PROVIDER, SUBJECT TO YOUR ADDITIONAL AUTHORIZATION, YOU AGREE TO ALLOW CARE.COM TO PERFORM THESE INTERNAL BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR THE PURPOSES DESCRIBED ABOVE. IF YOU DO NOT WANT THESE INTERNAL BACKGROUND CHECKS TO BE PERFORMED, YOU SHOULD NOT USE CARE.COM.** 

**4.6 Care.com May Regularly Verify Your Identity and the Accuracy of Your Representations and Warranties**

By registering as a Care Provider or Care Seeker, and, if applicable to you as a Care Provider, subject to your additional authorization, you authorize Care.com, and acknowledge that for purposes of promoting the safety and integrity of its Site and Service, Care.com reserves the right, but not the obligation, to utilize third party service providers to verify on an ongoing basis that your identity and registration data are accurate, and that the representations and warranties in Section 2 above addressing legal matters such as complaints, arrests, sex offender status, etc. are also true (“Verification Checks”). These third parties may use data from a variety of sources, under a variety of circumstances, for these site safety purposes including, without limitation, information from national criminal databases, sex offender registries, certain media streams, terrorist watch lists, criminal and fugitive watch lists, fraud watch lists, law enforcement reports, cell phone records databases, and other data.

You authorize your wireless carrier to use or disclose information about your account and your wireless device, if available, to Care.com or its service provider(s) for the duration of your business relationship, solely to help them identify you or your wireless device and to prevent fraud. See our Privacy Policy for how we treat your data.

You agree that Care.com may take such action in response to Verification Checks as it deems appropriate in its sole discretion, including without limitation suspending and/or terminating your account, should it determine that you have violated any representation or warranty or any other provision of these Terms or are otherwise unsuitable for Care.com.

You also hereby represent, understand and expressly agree that Care.com does not have control over or assume any responsibility for the quality, accuracy, or reliability of the information included in a Verification Check. We do not typically communicate the results of a Verification Check to any third party, though we reserve the right to do so for law enforcement or other safety-related purposes in accordance with applicable laws.

**BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, AND, IF APPLICABLE TO YOU AS A CARE PROVIDER SUBJECT TO YOUR ADDITIONAL AUTHORIZATION, YOU AGREE TO ALLOW CARE.COM TO PERFORM THE VERIFICATION CHECKS DESCRIBED ABOVE. IF YOU DO NOT WANT THESE VERIFICATION CHECKS TO BE PERFORMED, YOU SHOULD NOT USE CARE.COM.** 

**4.7 Important Limitations About Background Checks; Release of Liability for Results of Background Checks, Internal Background Checks, and Verification Checks** 

**SPECIAL NOTICE FOR MASSACHUSETTS AND NEW HAMPSHIRE:** Criminal County Searches conducted in Massachusetts and New Hampshire as part of the Criminal Records Check and the Criminal+MVR Records Check (for individuals who are believed to have lived in one or both of these states during the seven years preceding the background check request) search only the Superior Court and a single District Court in the county seat or its equivalent for each county listed below. Criminal records (including misdemeanors and felonies) from other courts in these states will not be searched.

This is an illustrative, non-comprehensive, list of certain state and county limitations of the background checks offered through Care.com; additional limitations may apply in certain jurisdictions, including on the federal level. For example, for many states only certain registered sex offender information is reported, and for many states, only a subset of felony convictions are reported (and not any misdemeanors, charges or arrest records).

In addition to legal and reporting system limitations of background checks, each check is performed with the authorization of the person being checked, using information he or she provides, such as home address, social security number, date of birth, and name. If a candidate provides incorrect information, the check might be run with inaccurate identifying data, which can impact the validity of the criminal check. Finally, criminal records are not always reported accurately or promptly, and human and electronic error can result in inaccurate or incomplete reporting. Consequently, even the most comprehensive background check offered may not disclose the existence of all criminal records in all jurisdictions.

If you decide to access, use, or share information provided by a Background Check, you agree to do so in accordance with applicable law. You also agree to release, indemnify and hold harmless Care.com from any loss, liability, injury, death, damage, or costs that may result from your use of, reliance on, or sharing of the information contained in a Background Check regardless of the cause, including, without limitation, due to the inaccuracy or incompleteness of any such information.

You expressly acknowledge that Care.com has no obligation to perform Background Checks, Internal Background Checks, or Verification Checks on any Registered Users. To the extent Care.com performs such checks on certain Registered Users, the checks are limited and should not be taken as complete, accurate, up-to-date or conclusive evidence of the accuracy of any information those users have provided or of their eligibility to use the Services.

**5. Termination**
------------------

Care.com reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to immediately terminate your access to all or part of the Care.com Site and/or Services, to remove your profile and/or any content posted by or about you from the Site, and/or to terminate your account with Care.com, with or without notice for any reason or no reason in its sole discretion, including without limitation if Care.com should determine that you are not eligible to use the Services, have violated any terms stated herein or in any of the Additional Terms, are not suitable for participation as a Registered User, have mis-used or mis-appropriated Site content, including but not limited to use on a “mirrored,” competitive, or third-party site. Upon termination, Care.com shall be under no obligation to provide you with a copy of any content posted by or about you on the Site. If we terminate your registration, we have no obligation to notify you of the reason, if any, for your termination.

**You understand and agree that, following any termination of any individual’s use of the Site or the Services, Care.com has the right, but not the obligation, to send a notice of such termination to other Registered Users with whom we believe the individual has corresponded.** Our decision to terminate an individual’s registration and/or to notify other Registered Users with whom we believe the individual has corresponded does not constitute, and should not be interpreted or used as information bearing on, the individual’s character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living.

**6. Privacy**
--------------

Care.com uses the information you provide on the Site or via the Services or in accordance with our [Privacy Policy](https://www.care.com/about/privacy-policy). For more information, see our full Privacy Policy, the terms of which are incorporated herein.

**7. Links To External Sites**
------------------------------

Links from the Site to external sites (including external sites that are framed by Care.com) or inclusion of advertisements and other third-party content on the Site, do not constitute an endorsement by Care.com of such sites or the content, products, advertising and other materials presented on such sites or of the products and services that are the subject of such third-party content, but are for users’ reference and convenience. Care.com does not control third-party sites or content, and is not responsible for them. Such sites and content are governed by their respective owners’ terms of use and privacy policies, and not these Terms or Care.com’s Privacy Policy.

Care.com expressly disclaims any liability derived from the use and/or viewing of links that may appear on this Site. All users hereby agree to hold Care.com harmless from any liability that may result from the use of links that may appear on the Site.

**8. Payment And Refund Policy**
--------------------------------

In order to utilize some Care.com Services or product offerings, the user of such Services or product offerings must pay Care.com either a recurring subscription, one-time, or other fees. In addition, the user is responsible for any state or local sales taxes associated with the Services or product offerings purchased. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for certain Care Seekers who enroll in Care.com and receive access to a paid membership subscription through their employer’s benefits program, the related subscription fee is paid by their employer, and the Care Seeker has no obligation to pay the automatically renewing subscription fee associated with such subscription so long as the subscription remains part of the employer’s benefits program.

**8.1 Billing and Payment**

If you sign up for a Care.com paid membership subscription (and thereby become a “Member”), or for a Service or product that includes a recurring fee, you agree to pay Care.com all charges associated with the subscription, Service, or product you choose, as described on the Site at the time you submit your payment information. You also authorize Care.com, or a third-party payment processor that works on our behalf, to charge your chosen payment method according to the terms of your chosen subscription, Service, or product. Care.com reserves the right to correct any errors or mistakes that it makes even if it has already requested or received payment.

To the extent you elect to purchase other Services or product offerings we may offer for a non-recurring fee, you authorize Care.com to charge your chosen payment provider for the Services and/or products you purchase. You agree that if Care.com already has your credit card on file as a result of prior purchases you have made, we may charge that credit card for the additional Services or products you purchase.

Care.com reserves the right to establish or change fees for any or all services or goods obtained through the use of the Site and/or Services at any time.  Care.com will use reasonable efforts to inform you of such fees, but you will be responsible for all fees incurred under your account regardless of your specific awareness of those fees.

**8.2 Automatic Subscription Renewal and Cancellation**

**ALL PAID MEMBERSHIP SUBSCRIPTIONS AND RECURRING FEE-BASED SERVICES OR PRODUCTS WILL CONTINUE INDEFINITELY UNTIL CANCELLED BY THE USER.** 

**FOR PAID MEMBERSHIP SUBSCRIPTIONS, YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW AT THE END OF YOUR CHOSEN TERM PERIOD FOR AN ADDITIONAL EQUIVALENT PERIOD AT THE SUBSCRIPTION RATE AND FREQUENCY DISCLOSED TO YOU ON THE SITE WHEN YOU ORIGINALLY SUBSCRIBED, UNLESS OTHERWISE PROVIDED AT THE TIME YOU SUBSCRIBED. IF YOU CHOOSE A SUBSCRIPTION TERM IN EXCESS OF ONE MONTH THAT ALLOWS YOU TO BE CHARGED MONTHLY OVER THE SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD, AND YOU DECIDE TO CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION DURING THE SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU WILL CONTINUE TO BE BILLED FOR THE SUBSCRIPTION ON A MONTHLY BASIS UNTIL THE END OF THE THEN-CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION TERM.** 

**FOR OTHER SERVICES OR PRODUCTS WITH RECURRING FEES, YOU WILL BE CHARGED THE FEE ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH PRODUCT OR SERVICE AT THE INTERVAL SPECIFIED AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE, UNTIL YOU EXPRESSLY CANCEL THE SERVICE OR PRODUCT.** 

**You further agree that Care.com may from time to time change the amount of any recurring fee to which you previously agreed as part of an automatically renewing subscription.**  We will notify you about increases in recurring fees by sending a notice to the email address registered in your account, or by placing a prominent notice on our Site, so that you can choose whether to continue using our Services. Material changes will go into effect no less than 30 days after we notify you. Non-material changes or clarifications will take effect immediately upon posting of the updated fees and/or their associated Additional Terms, on our Site.

You may cancel your paid membership subscription at any time by following the instructions on your [account settings](https://www.care.com/my-account-profile-p1040.html) page. If you cancel a paid subscription, you typically will be permitted to use your subscription until the end of your then-current subscription term. Your paid subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires, but your payment method will be charged, and you will be required to pay, any cancellation or other fees associated with your early termination and disclosed to you at the time you signed up for the subscription plan.

**8.3 Installment Plan Options**

From time to time, we may offer products or Services (including but not limited to premium subscriptions) that include an option to pay some or all of the applicable fees in installments. In the case of recurring subscriptions, the installment payment option may apply only to the initial subscription term, and not to any renewal or recurring terms or payments.

By selecting an installment payment option, you agree to pay Care.com all charges associated with the subscription, Service, or product you purchase, as described on the Site at the time you submit your payment information. You also authorize Care.com, or a third-party payment processor that works on our behalf, to charge your chosen payment method according to the terms of your chosen installment plan.

**If you purchase a Service (such as a premium subscription) you agree and understand that, unless otherwise required by applicable law, you are committing to make all of the agreed-upon installment payments, regardless of whether you cancel the purchased Service. If you cancel your subscription prior to completing all installment payments due, then, unless otherwise required by applicable law, the remaining balance of the subscription will remain due and payable pursuant to the installment payment schedule you agreed to.** 

If Care.com is not able to charge any payment to your chosen payment method, we reserve the right to pursue any remedy that may be available to us, including the right to suspend or terminate your premium subscription and/or your Care.com account. You agree that Care.com and its Affiliates have no liability related to the exercise of these remedies.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section is intended to limit or alter Care.com’s right to terminate your account at any time pursuant to Section 5 above.

**8.4 Free Trial Offers**

Care.com may offer limited-time free trial subscriptions to certain users from time-to-time. Users who sign up for a Care.com Service on a free trial basis may have limited access to the Service and/or features of the Site. If a user signs up for a free trial subscription, unless he or she cancels before the expiration of the free trial period, the user will be charged the price then in effect for a subscription to the Service, unless otherwise informed by Care.com at the time of original subscription. If a user does not want to continue with the Service after the expiration of the free trial period, the Care Seeker or Care Provider must downgrade or cancel their subscription, and request a refund of the subscription fee within thirty (30) days of being charged the subscription fee for the Service. Upon cancellation, the Care Seeker or Care Provider’s credit card will be refunded for the amount of the most recent subscription charge so long as he or she has not used the subscription after the expiration of the free trial period.

**8.5 Reward Points**

As part of your paid membership or as a promotion, we may issue you reward points redeemable for products or services as described on the Site. Such points may only be redeemed via the Site, have no cash value, are not redeemable for cash (except to the extent specifically required by law), and are non-transferrable and non-refundable under any circumstances. Reward points have no fixed value, but may be redeemed for the lesser of (1) the cost of the goods or services for which they are redeemed; (2) any maximums, caps, or limitations described on the Site; or (3) the maximum value of a point stated on the Site (which may change from time to time in the discretion of Care.com). Reward points may only be redeemed in whole increments up to the total value reflected on the Site. No partial redemptions of points are permitted. More than one reward point may be applied per transaction. Reward points issued in connection with a premium subscription or service will automatically be applied to such purchases before other available reward points. Reward points are valid for a limited time, as described on the Site and in any Additional Terms that may apply to the service through which the points are issued or redeemed. Any unused reward points are forfeited immediately if you do not maintain the required membership status (as described on the Site), or if you or we close or terminate your account pursuant to Section 5 above.

**8.6 Refund Policy**

**Except as set forth in these Terms or as described on the Site at the time you make a purchase, all payments for subscriptions, services or products made on or through the Site or Services are non-refundable, and there are no refunds or credits for unused or partially used subscriptions, services or products, even if you close your account or cancel your membership, subscription, service, or product in the middle of a term.** 

Moreover, you understand and agree that if Care.com terminates your account or cancels a membership, subscription, feature, product or service you have purchased based on our determination (which we may make in our sole discretion), that you (i) are not eligible to use the Services, (ii) have violated any terms stated herein or in any of the Additional Terms, (iii) are not suitable for participation as a Registered User, (iv) have misrepresented yourself or your identity, or (v) have misused or misappropriated Site content, including but not limited to use on a “mirrored,” competitive, or third-party site, you will not be entitled to a refund of all or any unused portion of your purchase.

**13. Agreement to Arbitrate**
------------------------------

**13.1 Agreement to Arbitrate**

This Section 13 is referred to in these Terms as the “Arbitration Agreement”. Unless you opt-out in accordance with the opt-out procedures set forth in Section 13.8 below, you agree that all claims relating to or arising out of these Terms or the breach thereof other than those expressly set out in Section 13.4, whether sounding in contract, tort, or otherwise that have arisen or may arise between you and Care.com or a Care.com Affiliate, whether relating to these Terms (including any alleged breach thereof), the Services, the Site, or otherwise, shall be resolved exclusively through **final and binding arbitration, rather than a court,** in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. This includes claims that arose, were asserted, or involve facts occurring before the existence of this Arbitration Agreement or any prior agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Arbitration Agreement, in accordance with the notice and opt-out provisions set forth herein.  Your rights will be determined by a **neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury**. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.

**13.2 Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief**

**YOU AND CARE.COM AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ARBITRATION, ACTION OR PROCEEDING. EXCEPT FOR AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 13.7, UNLESS BOTH YOU AND CARE.COM EXPRESSLY AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS AGAINST CARE.COM AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER CARE.COM USERS.** If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.

**13.3 Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution**

Care.com is always interested in resolving Disputes amicably and efficiently.  Accordingly, both parties acknowledge and agree that before they commence arbitration, they will first make a good faith effort to resolve such Dispute informally.  Such informal resolution requires first sending a written description of the Dispute to the other party. For any Dispute you initiate, you agree to send the written description of the Dispute along with the email address associated with your account, if applicable, to the following address:  Care.com, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 816 Congress St., Suite 800, Austin, TX 78701 The written description must be on an individual basis and provide, at minimum, the following information: your name; a description of the nature or basis of the Dispute; the specific relief sought; and proof of your relationship with Care.com. If the Dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after receipt of the written description of the notice, you and Care.com agree to follow the resolution procedures for any Dispute described in this Section 13.

The aforementioned informal dispute resolution process is a prerequisite and condition precedent to commencing any formal dispute resolution proceeding (“Claim”). The parties agree that any relevant limitations period and filing fees or other deadlines will be tolled while the parties engage in this informal dispute resolution process.

**13.4 Arbitration Procedures**

If we cannot resolve a Claim informally, any Claim either of us asserts will be resolved **only by binding arbitration (except as otherwise specifically provided herein) and not in courts of general jurisdiction**. Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the rules of National Arbitration and Mediation (“NAM”), including, as applicable, NAM Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures, Fees For Disputes When One of the Parties is a Consumer and the Mass Filing Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures in effect at the time any demand for arbitration is filed with NAM, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class or representative actions, as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information on NAM, please visit its website, [https://www.namadr.com/](https://www.namadr.com/). Information about NAM’s Rules and fees can be found at [https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/](https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/). If there is any inconsistency between the NAM Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, the terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms as a court would, including without limitation, the limitation of liability provisions in Section 11. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under the Terms and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court. If you are a Care.com registered user, any demand initiating arbitration, whether filed by You or Care.com, must include the email address you used to register with Care.com.

For all U.S. residents, the arbitration shall be held (i) at a location determined under the applicable NAM rules and procedures that is reasonably convenient for you and is no more than 100 miles from your home or place of business; or (ii) at another location you and we agree upon. For non-U.S. residents, the arbitration shall be held in Austin, TX (unless otherwise agreed by the parties). If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less you or Care.com may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and Care.com subject to the arbitrator’s discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. Attendance at any in-person hearing may be made by telephone by you and/or Care.com, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.

The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all claims relating to or arising out of this contract, or the breach thereof, whether sounding in contract, tort, or otherwise and all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be written, and binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. Subject to the applicable NAM rules and procedures, the parties agree that the arbitrator will have the discretion to allow the filing of dispositive motions if they are likely to efficiently resolve or narrow issues in dispute.

The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. Except for decisions in arbitrations that are joined together in a single batch as described in Section 13.7, an arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different Care.com users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same Care.com user to the extent required by applicable law.

Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all Claims through arbitration, each party retains the right to (i) elect to have any Claims resolved in small claims court on an individual basis for disputes and actions within the scope of such court’s jurisdiction, regardless of what forum the filing party initially chose; (ii) bring an action in state or federal court to protect its intellectual property rights (“intellectual property rights” in this context means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and other confidential or proprietary information, but not privacy or publicity rights);) and (iii) seek a declaratory judgment, injunction, or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction regarding whether a party’s claims are time-barred or may be brought in small claims court.  Seeking such relief shall not waive a party’s right to arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, and any filed arbitrations related to any action filed pursuant to this paragraph shall automatically be stayed pending the outcome of such action.

**13.5 Costs of Arbitration**

If you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Care.com will pay as much of any filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration in excess of $250 that the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive regardless of the outcome of the arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith, in which case arbitration fees (including attorneys’ fees) may be imposed upon you consistent with the arbitrator’s rules and the standard for sanctions set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11.  You are responsible for all other fees, including your own attorneys’ fees, unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise.  

The parties agree that NAM has discretion to reduce the amount or modify the timing of any administrative or arbitration fees due under NAM’s Rules where it deems appropriate (including as specified in Section 13.7) provided that such modification does not increase the costs to you, and you further agree that you waive any objection to such fee modification.  The parties also agree that a good-faith challenge by either party to the fees imposed by NAM does not constitute a default, waiver, or breach of this Arbitration Agreement while such challenge remains pending before NAM, the arbitrator, and/or a court of competent jurisdiction, and that any and all due dates for those fees shall be tolled during the pendency of such challenge.

**13.6 Confidentiality**

All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.

**13.7 Mass Filing Procedures**

To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, in the event 100 or more similar arbitration demands (those asserting the same or substantially similar facts or claims, and seeking the same or substantially similar relief) presented by or with the assistance or coordination of the same law firm(s) or organization(s) are submitted to NAM against Care.com within reasonably close proximity (“Mass Filing”), the parties agree (i) to administer the Mass Filing in batches of 100 demands per batch (to the extent there are fewer than 100 arbitration demands left over after the batching described above, a final batch will consist of the remaining demands) with only one batch filed, processed, and adjudicated at a time; (ii) to designate one arbitrator for each batch; (iii) to accept applicable fees, including any related fee reduction determined by NAM in its discretion; (iv) that no other demands for arbitration that are part of the Mass Filing may be filed, processed, or adjudicated until the prior batch of 100 is filed, processed, and adjudicated; (v) that fees associated with a demand for arbitration included in a Mass Filing, including fees owed by Care.com and the claimants, shall only be due after your demand for arbitration is included in a set of batch proceedings and that batch is properly designated for filing, processing, and adjudication; and (vi) that the staged process of batched proceedings, with each set including 100 demands, shall continue until each demand (including your demand) is adjudicated or otherwise resolved. Arbitrator selection for each batch shall be conducted to the greatest extent possible in accordance with the applicable NAM rules and procedures for such selection, and the arbitrator will determine the location where the proceedings will be conducted. 

You agree to cooperate in good faith with Care.com and the arbitration provider to implement such a “batch approach” or other similar approach to provide for an efficient resolution of claims, including the payment of combined reduced fees, set by NAM in its discretion, for each batch of claims.  The parties further agree to cooperate with each other and the arbitration provider or arbitrator to establish any other processes or procedures that the arbitration provider or arbitrator believe will provide for an efficient resolution of claims.  Any disagreement between the parties as to whether this provision applies or as to the process or procedure for batching shall be resolved by a procedural arbitrator appointed by NAM.  This “Batch Arbitration” provision shall in no way be interpreted as increasing the number of claims necessary to trigger the applicability of NAM’s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures or authorizing class arbitration of any kind.  Unless Care.com otherwise consents in writing, Care.com does not agree or consent to class arbitration, private attorney general arbitration, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as set forth in this Section 13.7.  If your demand for arbitration is included in the Mass Filing, your claims will remain tolled until your demand for arbitration is decided, withdrawn, or is settled. The parties agree that this batching provision is integral to the Arbitration Agreement insofar as it applies to a Mass Filing.  If the batching provision in this subpart (vi) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, and neither you nor Care.com shall be entitled to arbitrate any claim that is a part of the Mass Filing.

The results of the first batch of demands will be given to a NAM mediator selected from an initially proposed group of 5 mediators, with Care.com and the remaining claimants’ counsel being able to strike one mediator each and then rank the remaining mediators and the highest collectively ranked mediator being selected.  The selected mediator will try to facilitate a resolution of the remaining demands in the Mass Filing. After the results are provided to the mediator, Care.com, the mediator and the remaining claimants will have 90 days (the “Mediation Period”) to agree on a resolution or substantive methodology for resolving the outstanding demands. If they are unable to resolve the outstanding demands during the Mediation Period, and cannot agree on a methodology for resolving them through further arbitrations, either Care.com or any remaining claimant may opt out of the arbitration process and have the demand(s) proceed in court. Notice of the opt-out will be provided in writing within 60 days of the close of the Mediation Period.  If neither Care.com nor the remaining claimants opt out and they cannot agree to a methodology for resolving the remaining demands through further arbitration, the arbitrations will continue with the batching process.  Opt out of arbitration under this section shall not be construed as opt out of the “Class Action Waiver.” Absent notice of an opt-out, the arbitrations will proceed in the order determined by the sequential numbers assigned to demands in the Mass Filing.  

**13.8 Opt-Out Procedure**

You can choose to reject this Arbitration Agreement by mailing us a written opt-out notice (“Opt-Out Notice”) in accordance with the terms of this Section. For new Care.com users, the Opt-Out Notice must be postmarked no later than 30 Days after the date you use our Site or Services for the first time. If you are already a current Care.com user and previously accepted the Care.com Terms prior to the introduction of this Arbitration Agreement, the Opt-Out Notice must be postmarked no later than thirty (30) days from March 5, 2024. You must mail the Opt-Out Notice to Care.com, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 816 Congress St., Suite 800, Austin, TX 78701. The Opt-Out Notice must state that you do not agree to the Arbitration Agreement and must include your name, address, phone number, and the email address(es) used to log in to the Care.com account(s) to which the opt-out applies. You must sign the Opt-Out Notice for it to be effective. This procedure is the only way you can opt out of the Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of the Arbitration Agreement, Care.com will likewise not be bound by these arbitration provisions. If you opt out of the Arbitration Agreement, you may exercise your right to a trial by jury or judge, as permitted by applicable law, but any prior existing agreement to arbitrate disputes under a prior version of the Arbitration Agreement will not apply to claims not yet filed.  All other terms of these Terms will continue to apply.

**13.9 Future Changes to this Arbitration Agreement**

Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any material change to this Arbitration Agreement in the future, such change shall not be effective until 30 days from the date of posting, and shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against Care.com prior to the effective date of the change, but will apply to all claims not yet filed regardless of when such claims may have accrued. If Care.com changes this Arbitration Agreement, any failure to opt out within 30 days of such changes will be deemed acceptance of those changes.

**14. Governing Law and Jurisdiction**
--------------------------------------

These Terms, and all claims relating to or arising out of this contract, or the breach thereof, whether sounding in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, including Delaware’s statutes of limitations governing your claim, without giving effect to its principles of conflicts of law, provided that the Federal Arbitration Act shall govern the interpretation and enforcement of Section 13, the Arbitration Agreement.

Unless you and we agree otherwise, in the event that the Arbitration Agreement is found not to apply to you or to a particular claim or dispute (except for small-claims court actions), either as a result of your decision to opt-out of the Arbitration Agreement or as a result of a decision by the arbitrator or a court order, you agree that any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and Care.com must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in the State of Delaware.

You and Care.com agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within the State of Delaware for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.

Neither party shall have, or hold itself out to any third party as having any authority to make any statements, representations or commitments of any kind, or to take any action, that shall be binding on the other, except as provided for herein or authorized in writing by the party to be bound. The invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any term or provision of these Terms shall in no way effect the validity, legality or enforceability of any other term or provision of these Terms.

This Agreement will be binding on and will inure to the benefit of the legal representatives, successors and assigns of the parties hereto.

**17. Severability**
--------------------

If a court decides that any term or provision of these Terms other than Section 13 is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and these Terms shall be enforceable as so modified.

1\. **Description of Services; Limitations; User Responsibilities**
-------------------------------------------------------------------

### **1.1 About Our Services**

Care.com offers various Services to help its users find, coordinate, and maintain quality care. The Services we offer include, among others:

* We provide a platform for individuals seeking care services (such as individual or shared child care, senior care, special needs, pet care, tutoring and housekeeping services) and corporate care providers seeking to hire individual care providers (such as child centers, in-home care agencies, and senior living facilities) (each “Care Seekers”) to post jobs on the Site, and to search for, narrow, find, and communicate with individuals and entities who provide care services (“Care Providers”), and for Care Providers to post profiles on the Site and browse, search, and apply to jobs. We also provide functionality that allows Care Seekers to search for and message other Care Seekers to help facilitate shared child care services.
* We provide tools and information to help Care Seekers and Care Providers make more informed decisions, such as (i) our Safety Center at [https://www.care.com/safety-center-p1273.html](https://www.care.com/safety-center-p1273.html) which includes a safety guide and safety resources, (ii) verification dashboards on Care Provider profiles, which enable Care Seekers to check the status of a Care Provider’s various verifications, and (iii) a process for Care Seekers to obtain background check reports from third-party consumer reporting agencies on individual Care Providers who consent to the running and sharing of those reports.
* We provide a directory of entity Care Providers that operate care-related businesses such as child care centers, family child care centers, nanny agencies, au pairs agencies, summer camps, tutoring centers, in-home care agencies, senior care housing companies and housekeepers from which users may contact or request information.
* For certain Care Seekers who enroll in Care.com through their employer’s benefits program and for certain other Care Seekers, we offer through our subsidiaries LifeCare, Inc., Care Concierge, Inc. and Town and Country Resources, certain additional services, which are described in Additional Terms that are specific to those services.
* We provide an online community for Registered Users to communicate and share information with other Registered Users who share a common interest or bond.
* We offer through Stripe, Inc., (“Stripe”), a third party, a service that facilitates the payment of Care Providers by Care Seekers via credit card or debit card. These payment processing services are provided by Stripe and are subject to the [Stripe Connected Account Agreement](https://stripe.com/connect/account-terms), which includes the [Stripe Terms of Service](https://stripe.com/terms) (collectively, the “Stripe Services Agreement”). By agreeing to these Terms, Care Providers that use the payment service also agree to be bound by the Stripe Services Agreement, as the same may be modified by Stripe from time to time. As a condition of Care.com enabling payment processing services through Stripe, you agree to provide Care.com accurate and complete information about you, and you authorize Care.com to share it and transaction information related to your use of the payment processing services provided by Stripe. Care.com assumes no liability or responsibility for any payments you may make through this service, and all such payments are non-refundable. Care Providers who receive payments from Care Seekers through this service may also qualify for certain benefits under one or more programs that Care.com may offer from time to time.
* We offer eligible Care Providers access to various benefits from third party service providers, including, without limitation, those that offer access to health insurance, and other benefits.
* We offer, as part of the functionality contained in one or more of our mobile applications, the ability for Care Seekers and Care Providers to exchange information and conduct interviews via live video streams. This feature is powered by technology (the “OpenTok Platform”) licensed to us by TokBox, Inc., a third party independent of Care.com. Care Seekers and Care Providers shall not be deemed to have any contractual relationship with Tokbox, Inc. under these Terms of Use, and shall not be deemed to constitute third party beneficiaries under any agreement between Care.com and TokBox, Inc. Care.com shall be solely responsible for providing any customer service, if any, to Care Seekers or Care Providers that elect to use the OpenTok Platform. 

Our Services continue to grow and change. Please refer to our Site for further information about the Services we provide.

### **1.2 Limitations of our Services**

We offer Services to help our users find, coordinate, and maintain care for their families. However, except where specifically provided in these Terms, in any applicable Additional Terms, or on the Site itself,

* **Except for Backup Care Providers employed by our subsidiaries, we do not employ any Care Providers and are not responsible for the conduct, whether online or offline, of any Care Seeker, Care Provider, or other user of the Site or Services.** Care Seekers are responsible for compliance with all applicable employment and other laws in connection with any employment relationship they establish (such as applicable Ban-the-Box, Fair Chance, payroll, tax and minimum wage laws).
* **Care Seeker and Care Provider content is primarily user generated. We do not control or vet user-generated content for accuracy, and we do not assume and expressly disclaim any responsibility for the accuracy or reliability of any information provided by Care Providers or Care Seekers on or off the Site. We do not assume and expressly disclaim any liability that may result from the use of information provided on our Site.**
* **We do not refer or recommend Care Seekers or Care Providers nor do we make any representations about the suitability, reliability, timeliness, or accuracy of the services provided by Care Providers or the integrity, responsibility or actions of Care Seekers or Care Providers whether in public, private or offline interactions. Any screening of a Care Seeker or Care Provider and his, her or its information by Care.com is limited and should not be taken as complete, accurate, up-to-date or conclusive of the individual’s or entity’s suitability as an employer or care provider.**
* We are not an employment agency, and we do not secure or procure employees for any Care Seekers, nor do we secure or procure opportunities for employment for any Care Providers.
* We do not control, monitor, supervise, or oversee the quality, timing, hours, pay, legality, or any other aspect of services delivered by Care Providers, nor do we require Care Providers to accept or work any jobs or deliver any services at all.
* We do not provide any medical, diagnostic, treatment or clinical service or engage in any conduct that requires a professional license.
* We may offer certain Registered Users the opportunity to verify certain information such as their email address, cell phone number, or, in the case of child care centers, their state license information. If we indicate that certain information has been verified, it means that the user has complied with the process we have established for verifying such information. However, we do not guarantee, nor do we represent or warrant, that the information is accurate or that it belongs to the Registered User who supplied it. 

**Please review carefully the Release of Liability Form Third-Party Content and Conduct that appears in Section 9 below for important limitations on Care.com’s liability to which you are agreeing by using the Site and Services.** 

### **1.3 User Responsibilities**

**Registered Users are solely responsible for interviewing, vetting, performing background and reference checks on, verifying information provided by, and selecting an appropriate Care Seeker or Care Provider for themselves or their family. The only exception is when a third party we or one of our subsidiaries contracts with to provide services in support of the Backup Care Service selects on behalf of the Registered User the specific individual Backup Care Provider from the agency who will provide backup or senior care services. In that limited circumstance only, the agency (as opposed to the Registered User) is responsible for screening the Backup Care Provider it selects on behalf of the Registered User.** 

**Please visit our** [**Safety Center**](https://www.care.com/safety-center-p1273.html) **at** [**www.care.com/safety-center-p1273.html**](https://www.care.com/safety-center-p1273.html) **for recommendations on how to make more informed hiring and employment decisions, as well as for tips if you are a Care Seeker looking to find another Care Seeker with whom to share child care services in your area. Each Care Seeker is responsible for complying with all applicable employment and other laws in connection with any employment relationship they establish, including verifying the age of the Care Provider they select as well as that Care Provider’s eligibility to work in the US.**

**4. Background and Verification Checks**
-----------------------------------------

### **4.1 Care Providers Can Order or Authorize Background Checks about Themselves and Can Authorize the Sharing of Them with Other Members** 

Care.com offers to individuals who have registered as Care Providers and Care Seekers one or more background check services from third-party consumer reporting agencies (“Background Checks”). Certain background checks may be made available for purchase by both Care Seekers and Care Providers, while others may only be made only be available for purchase by Care Seekers or Care Providers. All background checks require payment of a separate fee by the Member who is initiating the background check request and are subject to the consent of the Care Provider on whom the check is being performed.

Each of these Background Checks is regulated by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”), and the background reports resulting from these services are considered “consumer reports” under FCRA. Consumer reports may contain information on your character, general reputation, personal characteristics, and mode of living, including but not limited to consumer credit, criminal history, workers’ compensation, driving, employment, military, civil, and educational data and reports.

Care.com will receive a copy of each Background Check you order or authorize through Care.com. See Section 4.4 below for information regarding Care.com’s use of these Background Checks. You are responsible for making sure that the email address you provide to Care.com is correct, knowing that sensitive information will be sent to it.

**If you are a Care Provider and you authorize a third-party background check ordered by a Care Seeker, the results of that background check will be made available to the Care Seeker who ordered it, regardless of its contents.** 

If you are a Care Provider and you have ordered a Background Check on yourself from a third-party consumer reporting agency through Care.com, we may indicate in your profile that you have completed that check. However, we will not share the results with any other site visitor or Registered User without your specific authorization.

### **4.2 Background Check Offerings Available to Individuals Who May Not Have Registered As Care Providers or Care Seekers** 

Through certain portions of the Site, we may from time to time offer to individuals who may or may not be registered as Care Seekers the opportunity to purchase certain background checks on caregivers who are not necessarily registered on Care.com. These background checks are performed by a third-party consumer reporting agency and are subject to the terms of Section 4.1, 4.3, and 4.7 except that (i) references to Care Seekers shall refer to individuals who order the checks regardless of whether they are registered as Care Seekers, (ii) references to Care Providers shall refer to individuals who authorize the check to be performed on themselves regardless of whether they are registered as Care Providers, and (iii) Care.com does not view the results of these checks regardless of whether the caregiver on whom the check is performed is registered as a Care Provider.

### **4.3 Special Responsibilities of Users of Background Check under FCRA** 

The use of any background check reports obtained through the Site is governed by the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”) and certain state laws. If you order or request access to background check on a Care Seeker, you are considered an end user of the check, and must agree to a required End User Certification before the check will be processed. This End User Certification requires you to certify that you will comply with the FCRA and any applicable state laws, and summarizes key legal obligations. A summary of your responsibilities in using the information contained the background check can be found [https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/using-consumer-reports-what-employers-need-know](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/using-consumer-reports-what-employers-need-know). If there is negative data in a check you receive, and you choose to take “adverse action” (i.e. if you choose to pass on that individual’s candidacy) on the basis of this negative data, you must agree to take certain procedural steps, which can be found at [https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/using-consumer-reports-what-employers-need-know](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/using-consumer-reports-what-employers-need-know). These include notifying the individual who is the subject of the report of your decision to take adverse action based on information contained in the report and the subject’s right to contest the accuracy or completeness of the report. Depending on the specific background check you order, Care.com may provide a mechanism for you to request that the consumer reporting agency who performed the check complete these steps on your behalf. Where such a mechanism is not available, you are responsible for making any required notifications yourself. If the subject contests the report with the consumer reporting agency, you are required to suspend the hiring process while the agency researches the accuracy and completeness of the report.

### **4.4 Care.com May Review and Use Background Checks You Order or Authorize About Yourself** 

**By registering for and using the Site or Services as an individual Care Provider, and subject to your authorization, you acknowledge and agree that Care.com may review and use any Background Checks you have ordered or authorized about yourself for the purpose of protecting the safety and integrity of our Site and its users, which may, in the case of certain Care Providers, be considered an employment purpose pursuant to the FCRA. Care.com reserves the right to terminate your membership based on the information contained in such report, even if such information was subsequently dismissed.** 

If Care.com terminates your membership or access to the Site on the basis of information in a Background Check, we will notify you and provide you the name and contact information of the consumer reporting agency that created the report. We will also provide you a copy of the report unless the consumer reporting agency has already provided you a copy or access to it. You hereby represent, understand and expressly agree that Care.com does not have control over or assume any responsibility for the quality, accuracy, or reliability of the information included in these Background Checks. Furthermore, any inaccuracies in the report must be addressed with the consumer reporting agency that issued it and not Care.com.

### **4.5 Care.com May Order and Use Background Screenings About You**

By registering for and using the Site or Services as a Care Seeker or Care Provider, you hereby acknowledge and agree that Care.com has the right, but not the obligation, to use a third-party consumer reporting agency on an ongoing basis to use your personal information to run periodic background screenings on you for the purpose of protecting the safety and integrity of our Site and its users (“Preliminary Membership Screens”), which may, in the case of certain Care Providers, be deemed to be an employment purpose under the FCRA. Subject to certain additional disclosures and authorizations, if applicable to you as a Care Provider, Care.com may order these screenings when you register with Care.com and thereafter in connection with your continued use of our Services and/or interaction with our Site (such as by contacting or communicating with other members, posting or updating a job or profile, ordering or authorizing a Background Check, etc.).

These Preliminary Membership Screens may also regulated by FCRA, and the background reports resulting from these services may be considered “consumer reports” under FCRA.

You understand and agree that Care.com may review the information provided by the third-party consumer reporting agency and that Care.com retains the right to terminate your Care.com registration based on the information it receives from these checks, even if such information was subsequently changed or corrected. If Care.com terminates your membership or access to the Site on the basis of information in a background report, we will notify you and provide you the name and contact information of the consumer reporting agency that created the report. We will also provide you access to a copy of the report unless the consumer reporting agency has already provided you a copy or access to it. You hereby represent, understand and expressly agree that Care.com does not have control over or assume any responsibility for the quality, accuracy, or reliability of the information included in these checks. Furthermore, any inaccuracies in the report must be addressed with the consumer reporting agency that issued it (and not Care.com) within the time period specified in your notice. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Care.com is under no obligation to reinstate any accounts it may have terminated even if the information that led to the termination is subsequently changed or corrected.

**BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS AND USING OUR SITE AND/OR SERVICES, AND, IF APPLICABLE TO YOU AS A CARE PROVIDER, SUBJECT TO YOUR ADDITIONAL AUTHORIZATION, YOU AGREE TO ALLOW CARE.COM TO PERFORM THESE INTERNAL BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR THE PURPOSES DESCRIBED ABOVE. IF YOU DO NOT WANT THESE INTERNAL BACKGROUND CHECKS TO BE PERFORMED, YOU SHOULD NOT USE CARE.COM.** 

### **4.6 Care.com May Regularly Verify Your Identity and the Accuracy of Your Representations and Warranties**

By registering as a Care Provider or Care Seeker, and, if applicable to you as a Care Provider, subject to your additional authorization, you authorize Care.com, and acknowledge that for purposes of promoting the safety and integrity of its Site and Service, Care.com reserves the right, but not the obligation, to utilize third party service providers to verify on an ongoing basis that your registration data is accurate and that the representations and warranties in Section 2 above addressing legal matters such as complaints, arrests, sex offender status, etc. are also true (“Verification Checks”). These third parties may use data from a variety of sources, under a variety of circumstances, for these site safety purposes including, without limitation, information from national criminal databases, sex offender registries, certain media streams, terrorist watch lists, criminal and fugitive watch lists, fraud watch lists, law enforcement reports, and other data.

You agree that Care.com may take such action in response to Verification Checks as it deems appropriate in its sole discretion, including without limitation suspending and/or terminating your membership, should it determine that you have violated any representation or warranty or any other provision of these Terms or are otherwise unsuitable for Care.com.

You also hereby represent, understand and expressly agree that Care.com does not have control over or assume any responsibility for the quality, accuracy, or reliability of the information included in a Verification Check. We do not typically communicate the results of a Verification Check to any third party, though we reserve the right to do so for law enforcement or other safety-related purposes in accordance with applicable laws.

**BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, AND, IF APPLICABLE TO YOU AS A CARE PROVIDER SUBJECT TO YOUR ADDITIONAL AUTHORIZATION, YOU AGREE TO ALLOW CARE.COM TO PERFORM THE VERIFICATION CHECKS DESCRIBED ABOVE. IF YOU DO NOT WANT THESE VERIFICATION CHECKS TO BE PERFORMED, YOU SHOULD NOT USE CARE.COM.** 

### **4.7 Important Limitations About Background Checks; Release of Liability for Results of Background Checks, Internal Background Checks, and Verification Checks** 

**SPECIAL NOTICE FOR MASSACHUSETTS AND NEW HAMPSHIRE:** Criminal County Searches conducted in Massachusetts and New Hampshire as part of the Criminal Records Check and the Criminal+MVR Records Check (for individuals who are believed to have lived in one or both of these states during the seven years preceding the background check request) search only the Superior Court and a single District Court in the county seat or its equivalent for each county listed below. Criminal records (including misdemeanors and felonies) from other courts in these states will not be searched.

This is an illustrative, non-comprehensive, list of certain state and county limitations of the background checks offered through Care.com; additional limitations may apply in certain jurisdictions, including on the federal level. For example, for many states only certain registered sex offender information is reported, and for many states, only a subset of felony convictions are reported (and not any misdemeanors, charges or arrest records).

In addition to legal and reporting system limitations of background checks, each check is performed with the authorization of the person being checked, using information he or she provides, such as home address, social security number, date of birth, and name. If a candidate provides incorrect information, the check might be run with inaccurate identifying data, which can impact the validity of the criminal check. Finally, criminal records are not always reported accurately or promptly, and human and electronic error can result in inaccurate or incomplete reporting. Consequently, even the most comprehensive background check offered may not disclose the existence of all criminal records in all jurisdictions.

If you decide to access, use, or share information provided by a Background Check, you agree to do so in accordance with applicable law. You also agree to release, indemnify and hold harmless Care.com from any loss, liability, injury, death, damage, or costs that may result from your use of, reliance on, or sharing of the information contained in a Background Check regardless of the cause, including, without limitation, due to the inaccuracy or incompleteness of any such information.

You expressly acknowledge that Care.com has no obligation to perform Background Checks, Internal Background Checks, or Verification Checks on any Registered Users. To the extent Care.com performs such checks on certain Registered Users, the checks are limited and should not be taken as complete, accurate, up-to-date or conclusive evidence of the accuracy of any information those users have provided or of their eligibility to use the Services.

**5. Termination**
------------------

Care.com reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to immediately terminate your access to all or part of the Care.com Site and/or Services, to remove your profile and/or any content posted by or about you from the Site, and/or to terminate your account with Care.com, with or without notice for any reason or no reason in its sole discretion, including without limitation if Care.com should determine that you are not eligible to use the Services, have violated any terms stated herein or in any of the Additional Terms, are not suitable for participation as a Registered User, have mis-used or mis-appropriated Site content, including but not limited to use on a “mirrored,” competitive, or third-party site. Upon termination, Care.com shall be under no obligation to provide you with a copy of any content posted by or about you on the Site. If we terminate your registration, we have no obligation to notify you of the reason, if any, for your termination.

**You understand and agree that, following any termination of any individual’s use of the Site or the Services, Care.com has the right, but not the obligation, to send a notice of such termination to other Registered Users with whom we believe the individual has corresponded.** Our decision to terminate an individual’s registration and/or to notify other Registered Users with whom we believe the individual has corresponded does not constitute, and should not be interpreted or used as information bearing on, the individual’s character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living.

**8. Payment And Refund Policy**
--------------------------------

In order to utilize some Care.com Services or product offerings, the user of such Services or product offerings must pay Care.com either a recurring subscription, one-time, or other fees. In addition, the user is responsible for any state or local sales taxes associated with the Services or product offerings purchased. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for certain Care Seekers who enroll in Care.com and receive access to a paid membership subscription through their employer’s benefits program, the related subscription fee is paid by their employer, and the Care Seeker has no obligation to pay the automatically renewing subscription fee associated with such subscription so long as the subscription remains part of the employer’s benefits program.

### **8.1 Billing and Payment**

If you sign up for a Care.com paid membership subscription, or for a Service or product that includes a recurring fee, you agree to pay Care.com all charges associated with the subscription, Service, or product you choose, as described on the Site at the time you submit your payment information. You also authorize Care.com, or a third-party payment processor that works on our behalf, to charge your chosen payment method according to the terms of your chosen subscription, Service, or product. Care.com reserves the right to correct any errors or mistakes that it makes even if it has already requested or received payment.

To the extent you elect to purchase other Services or product offerings we may offer for a non-recurring fee, you authorize Care.com to charge your chosen payment provider for the Services and/or products you purchase. You agree that if Care.com already has your credit card on file as a result of prior purchases you have made, we may charge that credit card for the additional Services or products you purchase.

Care.com reserves the right to establish or change fees for any or all services or goods obtained through the use of the Site and/or Services at any time.  Care.com will use reasonable efforts to inform you of such fees, but you will be responsible for all fees incurred under your account regardless of your specific awareness of those fees.

### **8.2 Automatic Subscription Renewal and Cancellation**

**ALL PAID MEMBERSHIP SUBSCRIPTIONS AND RECURRING FEE-BASED SERVICES OR PRODUCTS WILL CONTINUE INDEFINITELY UNTIL CANCELLED BY THE USER.** 

**FOR PAID MEMBERSHIP SUBSCRIPTIONS, YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW AT THE END OF YOUR CHOSEN TERM PERIOD FOR AN ADDITIONAL EQUIVALENT PERIOD AT THE SUBSCRIPTION RATE AND FREQUENCY DISCLOSED TO YOU ON THE SITE WHEN YOU ORIGINALLY SUBSCRIBED, UNLESS OTHERWISE PROVIDED AT THE TIME YOU SUBSCRIBED. IF YOU CHOOSE A SUBSCRIPTION TERM IN EXCESS OF ONE MONTH THAT ALLOWS YOU TO BE CHARGED MONTHLY OVER THE SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD, AND YOU DECIDE TO CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION DURING THE SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU WILL CONTINUE TO BE BILLED FOR THE SUBSCRIPTION ON A MONTHLY BASIS UNTIL THE END OF THE THEN-CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION TERM.** 

**FOR OTHER SERVICES OR PRODUCTS WITH RECURRING FEES, YOU WILL BE CHARGED THE FEE ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH PRODUCT OR SERVICE AT THE INTERVAL SPECIFIED AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE, UNTIL YOU EXPRESSLY CANCEL THE SERVICE OR PRODUCT.** 

**You further agree that Care.com may from time to time change the amount of any recurring fee to which you previously agreed as part of an automatically renewing subscription.**  We will notify you about increases in recurring fees by sending a notice to the email address registered in your account, or by placing a prominent notice on our Site, so that you can choose whether to continue using our Services. Material changes will go into effect no less than 30 days after we notify you. Non-material changes or clarifications will take effect immediately upon posting of the updated fees and/or their associated Additional Terms, on our Site.

You may cancel your paid membership subscription at any time by following the instructions on your [account settings](https://www.care.com/my-account-profile-p1040.html) page. If you cancel a paid subscription, you typically will be permitted to use your subscription until the end of your then-current subscription term. Your paid subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires, but your payment method will be charged, and you will be required to pay, any cancellation or other fees associated with your early termination and disclosed to you at the time you signed up for the subscription plan.

### **8.3 Installment Plan Options**

From time to time, we may offer products or Services (including but not limited to premium subscriptions) that include an option to pay some or all of the applicable fees in installments. In the case of recurring subscriptions, the installment payment option may apply only to the initial subscription term, and not to any renewal or recurring terms or payments.

By selecting an installment payment option, you agree to pay Care.com all charges associated with the subscription, Service, or product you purchase, as described on the Site at the time you submit your payment information. You also authorize Care.com, or a third-party payment processor that works on our behalf, to charge your chosen payment method according to the terms of your chosen installment plan.

**If you purchase a Service (such as a premium subscription) you agree and understand that, unless otherwise required by applicable law, you are committing to make all of the agreed-upon installment payments, regardless of whether you cancel the purchased Service. If you cancel your subscription prior to completing all installment payments due, then, unless otherwise required by applicable law, the remaining balance of the subscription will remain due and payable pursuant to the installment payment schedule you agreed to.** 

If Care.com is not able to charge any payment to your chosen payment method, we reserve the right to pursue any remedy that may be available to us, including the right to suspend or terminate your premium subscription and/or your Care.com account. You agree that Care.com and its Affiliates have no liability related to the exercise of these remedies.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section is intended to limit or alter Care.com’s right to terminate your account at any time pursuant to Section 5 above.

### **8.4 Free Trial Offers**

Care.com may offer limited-time free trial subscriptions to certain users from time-to-time. Users who sign up for a Care.com Service on a free trial basis may have limited access to the Service and/or features of the Site. If a user signs up for a free trial subscription, unless he or she cancels before the expiration of the free trial period, the user will be charged the price then in effect for a subscription to the Service, unless otherwise informed by Care.com at the time of original subscription. If a user does not want to continue with the Service after the expiration of the free trial period, the Care Seeker or Care Provider must downgrade or cancel their subscription, and request a refund of the subscription fee within thirty (30) days of being charged the subscription fee for the Service. Upon cancellation, the Care Seeker or Care Provider’s credit card will be refunded for the amount of the most recent subscription charge so long as he or she has not used the subscription after the expiration of the free trial period.

### **8.5 Reward Points**

As part of your membership or as a promotion, we may issue you reward points redeemable for products or services as described on the Site. Such points may only be redeemed via the Site, have no cash value, are not redeemable for cash (except to the extent specifically required by law), and are non-transferrable and non-refundable under any circumstances. Reward points have no fixed value, but may be redeemed for the lesser of (1) the cost of the goods or services for which they are redeemed; (2) any maximums, caps, or limitations described on the Site; or (3) the maximum value of a point stated on the Site (which may change from time to time in the discretion of Care.com). Reward points may only be redeemed in whole increments up to the total value reflected on the Site. No partial redemptions of points are permitted. More than one reward point may be applied per transaction. Reward points issued in connection with a premium subscription or service will automatically be applied to such purchases before other available reward points. Reward points are valid for a limited time, as described on the Site and in any Additional Terms that may apply to the service through which the points are issued or redeemed. Any unused reward points are forfeited immediately if you do not maintain the required membership status (as described on the Site), or if you or we close or terminate your account pursuant to Section 5 above.

**Except as set forth in these Terms or as described on the Site at the time you make a purchase, all payments for subscriptions, services or products made on or through the Site or Services are non-refundable, and there are no refunds or credits for unused or partially used subscriptions, services or products, even if you cancel your membership or a subscription, service, or product in the middle of a term.**

**13. Agreement to Arbitrate**
------------------------------

### **13.1 Agreement to Arbitrate**

This Section 13 is referred to in these Terms as the “Arbitration Agreement”. Unless you opt-out in accordance with the opt-out procedures set forth in Section 13.8 below, you agree that all claims relating to or arising out of these Terms or the breach thereof other than those expressly set out in Section 13.4, whether sounding in contract, tort, or otherwise that have arisen or may arise between you and Care.com or a Care.com Affiliate, whether relating to these Terms (including any alleged breach thereof), the Services, the Site, or otherwise, shall be resolved exclusively through **final and binding arbitration, rather than a court,** in accordance with the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. This includes claims that arose, were asserted, or involve facts occurring before the existence of this Arbitration Agreement or any prior agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Arbitration Agreement, in accordance with the notice and opt-out provisions set forth herein.  Your rights will be determined by a **neutral arbitrator, not a judge or jury**. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.

### **13.2 Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief**

**YOU AND CARE.COM AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ARBITRATION, ACTION OR PROCEEDING. EXCEPT FOR AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 13.7, UNLESS BOTH YOU AND CARE.COM EXPRESSLY AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS AGAINST CARE.COM AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER CARE.COM USERS.** If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.

### **13.3 Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution**

Care.com is always interested in resolving Disputes amicably and efficiently.  Accordingly, both parties acknowledge and agree that before they commence arbitration, they will first make a good faith effort to resolve such Dispute informally.  Such informal resolution requires first sending a written description of the Dispute to the other party. For any Dispute you initiate, you agree to send the written description of the Dispute along with the email address associated with your account, if applicable, to the following address:  Care.com, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 816 Congress St., Suite 800, Austin, TX 78701 The written description must be on an individual basis and provide, at minimum, the following information: your name; a description of the nature or basis of the Dispute; the specific relief sought; and proof of your relationship with Care.com. If the Dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after receipt of the written description of the notice, you and Care.com agree to follow the resolution procedures for any Dispute described in this Section 13.

The aforementioned informal dispute resolution process is a prerequisite and condition precedent to commencing any formal dispute resolution proceeding (“Claim”). The parties agree that any relevant limitations period and filing fees or other deadlines will be tolled while the parties engage in this informal dispute resolution process.

### **13.4 Arbitration Procedures**

If we cannot resolve a Claim informally, any Claim either of us asserts will be resolved **only by binding arbitration (except as otherwise specifically provided herein) and not in courts of general jurisdiction**. Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the rules of National Arbitration and Mediation (“NAM”), including, as applicable, NAM Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures, Fees For Disputes When One of the Parties is a Consumer and the Mass Filing Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures in effect at the time any demand for arbitration is filed with NAM, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class or representative actions, as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information on NAM, please visit its website, [https://www.namadr.com/](https://www.namadr.com/). Information about NAM’s Rules and fees can be found at [https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/](https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/). If there is any inconsistency between the NAM Rules and this Arbitration Agreement, the terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms as a court would, including without limitation, the limitation of liability provisions in Section 11. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under the Terms and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court. If you are a Care.com registered user, any demand initiating arbitration, whether filed by You or Care.com, must include the email address you used to register with Care.com.

For all U.S. residents, the arbitration shall be held (i) at a location determined under the applicable NAM rules and procedures that is reasonably convenient for you and is no more than 100 miles from your home or place of business; or (ii) at another location you and we agree upon. For non-U.S. residents, the arbitration shall be held in Austin, TX (unless otherwise agreed by the parties). If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less you or Care.com may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and Care.com subject to the arbitrator’s discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. Attendance at any in-person hearing may be made by telephone by you and/or Care.com, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.

The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all claims relating to or arising out of this contract, or the breach thereof, whether sounding in contract, tort, or otherwise and all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable, or whether a claim is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be written, and binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. Subject to the applicable NAM rules and procedures, the parties agree that the arbitrator will have the discretion to allow the filing of dispositive motions if they are likely to efficiently resolve or narrow issues in dispute.

The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. Except for decisions in arbitrations that are joined together in a single batch as described in Section 13.7, an arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different Care.com users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same Care.com user to the extent required by applicable law.

Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all Claims through arbitration, each party retains the right to (i) elect to have any Claims resolved in small claims court on an individual basis for disputes and actions within the scope of such court’s jurisdiction, regardless of what forum the filing party initially chose; (ii) bring an action in state or federal court to protect its intellectual property rights (“intellectual property rights” in this context means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and other confidential or proprietary information, but not privacy or publicity rights);) and (iii) seek a declaratory judgment, injunction, or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction regarding whether a party’s claims are time-barred or may be brought in small claims court.  Seeking such relief shall not waive a party’s right to arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, and any filed arbitrations related to any action filed pursuant to this paragraph shall automatically be stayed pending the outcome of such action.

### **13.5 Costs of Arbitration**

If you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Care.com will pay as much of any filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration in excess of $250 that the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive regardless of the outcome of the arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith, in which case arbitration fees (including attorneys’ fees) may be imposed upon you consistent with the arbitrator’s rules and the standard for sanctions set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11.  You are responsible for all other fees, including your own attorneys’ fees, unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise.  

The parties agree that NAM has discretion to reduce the amount or modify the timing of any administrative or arbitration fees due under NAM’s Rules where it deems appropriate (including as specified in Section 13.7) provided that such modification does not increase the costs to you, and you further agree that you waive any objection to such fee modification.  The parties also agree that a good-faith challenge by either party to the fees imposed by NAM does not constitute a default, waiver, or breach of this Arbitration Agreement while such challenge remains pending before NAM, the arbitrator, and/or a court of competent jurisdiction, and that any and all due dates for those fees shall be tolled during the pendency of such challenge.

### **13.6 Confidentiality**

All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties.

### **13.7 Mass Filing Procedures**

To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, in the event 100 or more similar arbitration demands (those asserting the same or substantially similar facts or claims, and seeking the same or substantially similar relief) presented by or with the assistance or coordination of the same law firm(s) or organization(s) are submitted to NAM against Care.com within reasonably close proximity (“Mass Filing”), the parties agree (i) to administer the Mass Filing in batches of 100 demands per batch (to the extent there are fewer than 100 arbitration demands left over after the batching described above, a final batch will consist of the remaining demands) with only one batch filed, processed, and adjudicated at a time; (ii) to designate one arbitrator for each batch; (iii) to accept applicable fees, including any related fee reduction determined by NAM in its discretion; (iv) that no other demands for arbitration that are part of the Mass Filing may be filed, processed, or adjudicated until the prior batch of 100 is filed, processed, and adjudicated; (v) that fees associated with a demand for arbitration included in a Mass Filing, including fees owed by Care.com and the claimants, shall only be due after your demand for arbitration is included in a set of batch proceedings and that batch is properly designated for filing, processing, and adjudication; and (vi) that the staged process of batched proceedings, with each set including 100 demands, shall continue until each demand (including your demand) is adjudicated or otherwise resolved. Arbitrator selection for each batch shall be conducted to the greatest extent possible in accordance with the applicable NAM rules and procedures for such selection, and the arbitrator will determine the location where the proceedings will be conducted. 

You agree to cooperate in good faith with Care.com and the arbitration provider to implement such a “batch approach” or other similar approach to provide for an efficient resolution of claims, including the payment of combined reduced fees, set by NAM in its discretion, for each batch of claims.  The parties further agree to cooperate with each other and the arbitration provider or arbitrator to establish any other processes or procedures that the arbitration provider or arbitrator believe will provide for an efficient resolution of claims.  Any disagreement between the parties as to whether this provision applies or as to the process or procedure for batching shall be resolved by a procedural arbitrator appointed by NAM.  This “Batch Arbitration” provision shall in no way be interpreted as increasing the number of claims necessary to trigger the applicability of NAM’s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures or authorizing class arbitration of any kind.  Unless Care.com otherwise consents in writing, Care.com does not agree or consent to class arbitration, private attorney general arbitration, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as set forth in this Section 13.7.  If your demand for arbitration is included in the Mass Filing, your claims will remain tolled until your demand for arbitration is decided, withdrawn, or is settled. The parties agree that this batching provision is integral to the Arbitration Agreement insofar as it applies to a Mass Filing.  If the batching provision in this subpart (vi) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, and neither you nor Care.com shall be entitled to arbitrate any claim that is a part of the Mass Filing.

The results of the first batch of demands will be given to a NAM mediator selected from an initially proposed group of 5 mediators, with Care.com and the remaining claimants’ counsel being able to strike one mediator each and then rank the remaining mediators and the highest collectively ranked mediator being selected.  The selected mediator will try to facilitate a resolution of the remaining demands in the Mass Filing. After the results are provided to the mediator, Care.com, the mediator and the remaining claimants will have 90 days (the “Mediation Period”) to agree on a resolution or substantive methodology for resolving the outstanding demands. If they are unable to resolve the outstanding demands during the Mediation Period, and cannot agree on a methodology for resolving them through further arbitrations, either Care.com or any remaining claimant may opt out of the arbitration process and have the demand(s) proceed in court. Notice of the opt-out will be provided in writing within 60 days of the close of the Mediation Period.  If neither Care.com nor the remaining claimants opt out and they cannot agree to a methodology for resolving the remaining demands through further arbitration, the arbitrations will continue with the batching process.  Opt out of arbitration under this section shall not be construed as opt out of the “Class Action Waiver.” Absent notice of an opt-out, the arbitrations will proceed in the order determined by the sequential numbers assigned to demands in the Mass Filing.  

### **13.8 Opt-Out Procedure**

You can choose to reject this Arbitration Agreement by mailing us a written opt-out notice (“Opt-Out Notice”) in accordance with the terms of this Section. For new Care.com users, the Opt-Out Notice must be postmarked no later than 30 Days after the date you use our Site or Services for the first time. If you are already a current Care.com user and previously accepted the Care.com Terms prior to the introduction of this Arbitration Agreement, the Opt-Out Notice must be postmarked no later than thirty (30) days from March 5, 2024. You must mail the Opt-Out Notice to Care.com, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 816 Congress St., Suite 800, Austin, TX 78701. The Opt-Out Notice must state that you do not agree to the Arbitration Agreement and must include your name, address, phone number, and the email address(es) used to log in to the Care.com account(s) to which the opt-out applies. You must sign the Opt-Out Notice for it to be effective. This procedure is the only way you can opt out of the Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of the Arbitration Agreement, Care.com will likewise not be bound by these arbitration provisions. If you opt out of the Arbitration Agreement, you may exercise your right to a trial by jury or judge, as permitted by applicable law, but any prior existing agreement to arbitrate disputes under a prior version of the Arbitration Agreement will not apply to claims not yet filed.  All other terms of these Terms will continue to apply.

### **13.9 Future Changes to this Arbitration Agreement**

Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any material change to this Arbitration Agreement in the future, such change shall not be effective until 30 days from the date of posting, and shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding against Care.com prior to the effective date of the change, but will apply to all claims not yet filed regardless of when such claims may have accrued. If Care.com changes this Arbitration Agreement, any failure to opt out within 30 days of such changes will be deemed acceptance of those changes.

**14. Governing Law and Jurisdiction**
--------------------------------------

These Terms, and all claims relating to or arising out of this contract, or the breach thereof, whether sounding in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, including Delaware’s statutes of limitations governing your claim, without giving effect to its principles of conflicts of law, provided that the Federal Arbitration Act shall govern the interpretation and enforcement of Section 13, the Arbitration Agreement.

Unless you and we agree otherwise, in the event that the Arbitration Agreement is found not to apply to you or to a particular claim or dispute (except for small-claims court actions), either as a result of your decision to opt-out of the Arbitration Agreement or as a result of a decision by the arbitrator or a court order, you agree that any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and Care.com must be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in the State of Delaware.

You and Care.com agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within the State of Delaware for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.

**15. Consent to Electronic Communication**
-------------------------------------------

By using the Site or Services of Care.com, you agree to allow Care.com to communicate with you electronically, and you consent to electronic delivery of notices, documents, or products (including, without limitation, reports or copies of Background Checks and Preliminary Membership Screens) from Care.com via the Care.com Site, Services, mobile application, online messaging platform, or e-mail. You also agree to check your Care.com account, alerts, and messages, and the e-mail account reflected on your Care.com (which you are also required to keep updated) on a reasonably regular basis to stay apprised of important notices and information about your account.

**16. Miscellaneous**
---------------------

Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as making either party the partner, joint venturer, agent, legal representative, employer, contractor or employee of the other. Neither party shall have, or hold itself out to any third party as having any authority to make any statements, representations or commitments of any kind, or to take any action, that shall be binding on the other, except as provided for herein or authorized in writing by the party to be bound. The invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any term or provision of these Terms shall in no way effect the validity, legality or enforceability of any other term or provision of these Terms. Each Affiliate (as defined in Section 1.2) is expressly made a third party beneficiary of this Agreement and may enforce this Agreement directly against you. This Agreement will be binding on and will inure to the benefit of the legal representatives, successors and assigns of the parties hereto.

**17. Severability**
--------------------

If a court decides that any term or provision of these Terms other than Section 13 is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and these Terms shall be enforceable as so modified.
