Refund Policy
=============

Effective date: May 15, 2024

You’re going to love Clario.

But if you don’t, no worries. We understand that situations may arise where a refund is necessary, and we have established the following refund policy to address such cases.

Refund Eligibility
------------------

### Clario Software

* Monthly Subscription: You are eligible for a full refund within 14 days of your initial purchase.
* All other Subscription Types (3-Month, 6-Month, 1-Year, etc.): You can request a full refund within 30 days of your initial purchase.

### Clario Premium Services

* You are eligible for a full refund within 14 days of your initial purchase of all subscription plans of Premium Services.
* After 14 days, but within 6 months from the date of purchase, you can receive a refund in the amount that corresponds to the difference between the price of the subscription plan and the cost of a 1-month plan ($199). However, if you had your devices fixed more than 3 times during the 6-month period, then an additional $69 will be deducted from the amount to be refunded for every subsequent fix occurred after the third one.

Please note that a refund request can only be claimed during the subscription period. If you have used the service for more than 6 months or 10 times within the 6-month period, it becomes non-refundable.

LOW-COST TRIAL OR PROMOTIONAL PRICE
-----------------------------------

The initial payment for the subscription may be offered at a discount or promotional price. Subsequent payments may be subject to higher prices as outlined in the subscription plan or as updated by us from time to time. You can cancel your subscription at any time. To avoid being charged for the next billing cycle, you must cancel at least 24 hours before the end of the current subscription period by writing to us at [support@weareclario.com](mailto:premium.services@weareclario.com) or via your account settings. Your cancellation will take effect at the end of the current paid term. Please note that you are eligible for a full refund only within 14 days of your initial purchase.

If you have enrolled in a low-cost trial of our product or service and are not satisfied, you may be eligible for a refund.

Case-by-case Refunds Or Subscription Prolongation
-------------------------------------------------

In certain situations, we may consider case-by-case partial refunds or prolongation of the subscription period. This will be evaluated based on individual circumstances and at the discretion of our company. We encourage you to contact our customer support team to discuss your specific case.

IMPORTANT
---------

Your refund eligibility may differ if the purchase was made through a third party (e.g. App Store, a service provider, a reseller, etc.). For more information and to review your offer terms, please contact your service provider or reseller directly. We cannot provide refunds for purchases made through third-party retailers or resellers.

Refer to [Cancel subscription or request refund for purchase on Google Play](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7018481?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform=Android) for more information on Google Play purchases and refund procedures, and

Refer to [Request a refund for apps or content that you bought from Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-ie/HT204084) for Apple App Store purchases.

How can I get a refund?
-----------------------

To request a refund, please contact our customer support team at [support@weareclario.com](mailto:support@weareclario.com) regarding Clario software and [premium.services@weareclario.com](mailto:premium.services@weareclario.com) regarding Clario services, or reach out to us through live chat.

How long does it take to receive my refund?
-------------------------------------------

Once we receive your refund request, generally, you can expect it to appear in your account within 10 business days. Once the refund has been processed, you will also receive a confirmation email indicating the refund has been issued.

Where can I find out more about your refund policy?
---------------------------------------------------

If you have questions about requesting a refund, please contact our customer support team at [support@weareclario.com](mailto:support@weareclario.com). We are available 24/7 to give you assistance.

What happens after I have received my refund?

Once you receive your refund, your access to Clario software and/or Clario services will be terminated. You will no longer be able to use the software, and any associated features or services will no longer be available to you. It is recommended to uninstall Clario to prevent any potential conflicts or issues.
