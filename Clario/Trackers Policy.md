This Cookie Policy clearly outlines the use of cookies by Clario Tech DMCC, located at Unit No: 3005-D6, Swiss Tower, Plot No: JLT-PH2-Y3A, Jumeirah Lakes Towers, Dubai, UAE (“Clario” or “Company”). By continuing to browse our [https://clario.co](https://clario.co/) (“Website”), you signify that you understand and agree to the use of these technologies, as described in this policy as well as with our [Privacy Notice](https://clario.co/privacy-notice/). You do not have to accept cookies and consent can be withdrawn at any time (see How to control the use of cookies, below).

None of our cookies can be used to identify you personally. This means cookies don’t store your location, email address or IP address. They are just used to help make our website better for you. For further information, visit [http://aboutcookies.org](http://aboutcookies.org/). This policy contains relevant information about our use of cookies, why we use cookies, and what are your rights.

**What are cookies?**
---------------------

A cookie is a small text file that gets saved on your device when you visit our website. It allows the website to remember your actions and preferences (such as browser language, font size, and other display preferences) over time. This information improves website performance and helps us to optimise our website on an ongoing basis.
