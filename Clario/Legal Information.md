**5\. Do we share or disclose your data?**
------------------------------------------

We may share your data with some companies, consultants and contractors which we hire to provide limited services on our behalf and which value data privacy as much as we do. We will only provide those companies with personal data they need to deliver the service. Also, we may disclose your data if we receive a governmental request and when it is required by applicable law. Or we may share data with your consent. We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal data to anyone.

**Do-not-track requests.** California residents visiting our website may request that we do not automatically gather and track information pertaining to their online browsing movements across the Internet. Such requests are typically made through web browser settings that control signals or other mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personal data about an individual consumer's online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services. We currently do not have the ability to honor these requests. We may modify this Notice as our abilities change.

**10\. Changes to this Notice**
