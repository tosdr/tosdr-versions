You must in no event use, nor allow others to use, the Software or this License for commercial purposes without obtaining a license to do so from the Company in written form.

description of the functionalities
----------------------------------

The Software can be run on the following operating systems: macOS,Windows, iOS, and Android. The features may vary depending on the kind of operating system and version of the software.

Clario is an application that secures online browsing, connections, guards personal data and fixes device vulnerabilities. It achieves these goals through a range of features, including but not limited to:

1. Antivirus that helps to detect potentially harmful files infected with viruses, spyware, malware, and so on by running real-time monitoring and blocking from running malicious files. You can scan a specific file or folder for viruses, or check Your entire device.
2. Virtual Location that protects users’ browsing activity (searches, websites) from being tracked through blocking trackers on websites, connecting users to virtual private networks.
3. Identity Protection that helps you to monitor Your accounts for data breaches and providing tech experts to assist You with the consequences of personal data leakage. Our Data breach check is to enable You to reveal past third-party breaches of Your personal data on the dark web and minimise the future risk of abuse of Your personal data. Also, an enabled 24/7 Data breach monitor within the software will notify You whether You have been compromised in new data breaches and if Your personal data has been exposed on the dark web based on the email address You submitted.
4. Checking your privacy settings with respect to both two-factor authentication and activity status enablement. Once You provide us with your account details, we may tell you if You need to enable two-factor authentication and turn off Your activity status.

Clario Secure Browsing Extension (“extension”) is the application to help protect users from annoying ads and online trackers that may spy on your browsing and search habits. The extension is developed for Chrome browser.

Certain technical support is offered from within the Software, or chat (live chat) 24/7. Our experts may offer remote access services to assist in diagnosing and resolving security and privacy issues. In addition, experts will be able to help you fix technical issues and answer system questions related to your device.

When you request help from our experts, they may access your device remotely via third-party software, such as LogMeIn® and TeamViewer. By accepting our Agreement and [Privacy Policy](https://clario.co/privacy-policy/), you therefore accept the [Terms & Conditions](https://www.logmein.com/legal/terms-and-conditions) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.logmein.com/legal/privacy) of LogMeIn® and [Terms & Conditions](https://www.teamviewer.com/en/eula/) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.teamviewer.com/en/privacy-policy/) of TeamViewer.

CHANGES TO THE SOFTWARE
-----------------------

This Agreement governs any releases, revisions, updates, upgrades or enhancements to the Software and services made available to You. It may be necessary in order to continue using the Software on certain hardware. You agree that the Software may install modifications automatically. In case the Software update contains any paid offers, You will be notified about this via the Software itself, and You will have the possibility to decline the installation of such updates. You may have the right to refuse the installation of new updates and upgrades of the Software. However, in that case, the Company does not accept any responsibility for further proper work of the Software and services. You agree that the Company may stop to support previous versions of the Software upon availability of an updated version.

FREE TRIALS
-----------

The Company may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time (“Free Trial”). You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for the Free Trial. If you do enter your billing information when signing up for the Free Trial, you will not be charged by us until the Free Trial has expired. You will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected on the last day of the Free Trial period, unless you have canceled your Subscription. At any time, we reserve the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.

LOW-COST TRIALS
---------------

THE COMPANY MAY OFFER A LOW-COST TRIAL TO EVALUATE THE SOFTWARE'S FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY BEFORE MAKING A FULL PURCHASE. DURING THE LOW-COST TRIAL PERIOD, USERS WILL BE REQUIRED TO PAY THE SPECIFIED TRIAL PRICE AS DETERMINED BY THE COMPANY. THIS TRIAL PRICE IS LOWER THAN THE REGULAR PRICE OF THE SOFTWARE AND IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE USERS WITH AN AFFORDABLE OPPORTUNITY TO TRY THE PRODUCT. THE COMPANY MAY LIMIT CERTAIN FEATURES OR FUNCTIONALITY OF THE SOFTWARE DURING THE LOW-COST TRIAL PERIOD. USERS MAY NOT HAVE ACCESS TO ALL THE FEATURES AVAILABLE IN THE FULL VERSION OF THE SOFTWARE. AT THE END OF THE LOW-COST TRIAL PERIOD, USERS MAY HAVE THE OPTION TO CONVERT TO THE FULL VERSION OF THE SOFTWARE BY PURCHASING A REGULAR LICENSE. THE TERMS AND PRICING FOR THE FULL VERSION WILL BE PROVIDED SEPARATELY, AND THE USER'S CONTINUED USE OF THE SOFTWARE AFTER THE TRIAL PERIOD CONSTITUTES ACCEPTANCE OF THOSE TERMS. THE COMPANY RESERVES THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE OR MODIFY THE LOW-COST TRIAL OFFER AT ANY TIME, WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE. IN SUCH CASES, THE COMPANY WILL COMMUNICATE ANY CHANGES OR TERMINATION TO THE USERS THROUGH APPROPRIATE CHANNELS.

RECURRING PAYMENTS FOR SOFTWARE (AUTO-RENEWAL)
----------------------------------------------

OUR SOFTWARE IS BILLED ON A SUBSCRIPTION BASIS (“SUBSCRIPTION(S)"). YOU WILL BE BILLED IN ADVANCE ON A RECURRING AND PERIODIC BASIS (“BILLING CYCLE”). BILLING CYCLES ARE SET ON A REGULAR BASIS, TYPICALLY MONTHLY OR YEARLY. YOU AGREE TO PAY FOR THE SUBSCRIPTION YOU SELECT FOR THE SOFTWARE AND YOU AUTHORIZE US TO AUTOMATICALLY CHARGE THE PAYMENT METHOD OUR SERVICE PROVIDER HAS ON FILE FOR YOUR RECURRING PAYMENTS.

AT THE END OF EACH BILLING CYCLE, YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW UNDER THE SAME CONDITIONS UNLESS YOU CANCEL IT OR WE CANCEL IT. ALSO, AS PART OF OUR COMMITMENT TO PROVIDING VALUE TO OUR CUSTOMERS, WE MAY, AT OUR OWN DISCRETION, PERIODICALLY OFFER A DISCOUNT ON RECURRING PAYMENTS. AFTER THE DISCOUNTED PERIOD EXPIRES, THE SUBSEQUENT PAYMENT(S) WILL BE REBILLED AT THE ORIGINAL PRICE, AS STATED IN THE INITIAL AGREEMENT. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO MODIFY OR DISCONTINUE THE RECURRING PAYMENT DISCOUNT OFFER AT ANY TIME, AT OUR SOLE DISCRETION. YOU MAY CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION RENEWAL BY CONTACTING OUR CUSTOMER SUPPORT TEAM AT [SUPPORT@WEARECLARIO.COM](mailto:support@weareclario.com). ONCE YOU HAVE CANCELED YOUR AUTOMATIC RENEWAL, RECURRING SUBSCRIPTION FEES FOR SERVICE FEES WILL NO LONGER BE CHARGED TO THE PAYMENT METHOD WE HAVE ON FILE FOR YOUR ACCOUNT. YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WILL REMAIN ACTIVE ONLY UNTIL THE END OF THE TERM FOR WHICH YOU HAVE FULLY PAID THE SOFTWARE FEE. THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A SEPARATE [REFUND POLICY](https://clario.co/refund-policy/) THAT OUTLINES THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS RELATED TO REFUNDS, IF APPLICABLE.

A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide our third-party payment processor with accurate and complete billing information including full name, email address, zip code, and valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize us to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments. You further agree to be responsible for all taxes associated with the Software, along with any transaction fees and currency conversions added by Your financial institution and intermediaries. If the billing method we agree is by credit or debit card (“Payment Card”), You:

1. represent that you are authorized to use such Payment Card;
2. authorize us to charge your Payment Card on a periodic basis for the Fees when due, including upon sign up for the Software and upon renewal;
3. agree to keep your Payment Card details valid and current and;
4. agree to pay any processing fees charged by the third-party payment processors or Payment Card issuer. If your Payment Card is declined when we attempt to charge it, we may try to charge it again at a later time. If we do not receive payment, we may suspend or terminate Your Subscription.

SURVIVAL OF PROVISIONS

LIMITED LIABILITY

THE COMPANY DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE. FUNCTIONS AND FEATURES ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE AFTER INSTALLATION BY THE USER.

THE COMPANY SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU, OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY CLAIMING THROUGH YOU ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, INCOME, SAVINGS, OR ANY OTHER CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, DIRECT OR INDIRECT DAMAGE, WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT, WARRANTY, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF THE COMPANY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

You agree to fully cooperate with the Company upon its request.

FORCE MAJEURE

You must comply with all applicable U.S. and international laws governing export and re-export of the software, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, as well as end-user, end-use and destination restrictions issued by U.S. and other governments. Without derogating from the generality of the foregoing, you represent, warrant and undertake that: (i) you are not a member of any of the denied persons list, unverified list, entity list, specially designated nationals list, debarred list or any other lists published by the U.S. Government; and (ii) you will not use, export or re-export any certain software developed by the Company in, or to, territories, destinations, companies or individuals in violation of U.S. and E.U. embargoes or trade sanctions.

This Agreement is the entire agreement between You and the Company relating to the Software and supersedes all prior oral or written communications and representation with respect to the Software or any other subject matter covered by this Agreement. If any of the provisions of this Agreement are held to be void, unenforceable or illegal, the other provisions shall continue in full force and effect. The affected provision will be construed as limited to the extent necessary to be consistent with and fully enforceable under the applicable law.

GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION
------------------------------

THIS EULA REQUIRES THE USE OF MEDIATION AND ARBITRATION TO RESOLVE DISPUTES RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS IN COURT.

The laws of England and Wales, excluding the laws of conflict, shall exclusively govern all matters with respect to this Agreement, including its execution, validity, performance, interpretation and termination. The parties will seek to resolve by negotiations any disputes which may arise in connection with this Agreement or further agreements resulting therefrom. If the Parties fail to agree in negotiations within 30 (thirty) calendar days from the date of their beginning, the dispute shall be finally settled by arbitration administered by the International Centre for Dispute Resolution® in accordance with its International Dispute Resolution Procedures, as modified by the ICDR® Online Protocol for Manufacturer/Supplier Disputes then in effect. The language used in any arbitral proceedings shall be English.

CLASS ACTION
------------

All claims must be brought in the parties' individual capacity, and not as a claimant or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding, and, unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims.

QUESTIONS
---------

We are open to any questions, comments and suggestions on this Agreement. Please address all Your inquiries to [legal@weareclario.com.](mailto:legal@weareclario.com)
