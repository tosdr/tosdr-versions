3. **Legal basis for use of your personal information**
    1. We consider that the legal bases for using your personal information as set out in this privacy policy are as follows:
        * our use of your personal information is necessary to perform our obligations under any contract with you (for example, to comply with the terms of use of our website and/or app which you accept by browsing our website and/or app and/or to comply with our contract to provide services to you (including without limitation membership subscription, competitions, offers or your user account) or to receive services from you or your employer); or
        * our use of your personal information is necessary for complying with our legal obligations; or
        * where neither of these apply, use of your personal information is necessary for our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others (for example, to ensure the security of our website). Our legitimate interests are to:
            
            * run, grow and develop our business
            * carry out marketing, market research and business development
            * to build a profile of your interests and preferences so that we can deliver targeted marketing and advertising to you. You can read more about our use of third-party advertising companies in the Marketing section below
            * for internal administrative purposes.
            
            If we rely on our (or another person's) legitimate interests for using your personal information, we will undertake a balancing test to ensure that our (or the other person's) legitimate interests are not outweighed by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms which require protection of the personal information. You can ask us for information on this balancing test by using the contact details at [section 12](#s12).
    2. We may use your special categories of data (such as political and religious views and health and wellbeing information) where you have provided your consent (which you may withdraw at any time after giving it, as described below).
    3. We may process your personal information in some cases for marketing purposes on the basis of your consent (which you may withdraw at any time after giving it, as described below).
    4. If we rely on your consent for us to use your personal information in a particular way, but you later change your mind, you may withdraw your consent by contacting us at [community@gbnews.com](mailto:community@gbnews.com) and we will stop doing so. However, if you withdraw your consent, this may impact the ability for us to be able to provide broadcasting and associated services to you.
4. **How and why we share your personal information with others**
    1. We may share your personal information with our group companies where it is in our legitimate interests to do so for internal administrative purposes (for example, for corporate strategy, compliance, auditing and monitoring, research and development and quality assurance).

        * analytics and service providers that assist us to understand the activities and preferences of the users of our services in order to improve and optimise the services we provide to them and enhance our business offerings and activities.
    3. Any third parties with whom we share your personal information are limited (by law and by contract) in their ability to use your personal information for any purpose other than to provide services for us. We will always ensure that any third parties with whom we share your personal information are subject to privacy and security obligations consistent with this privacy policy and applicable laws.
    4. We will also disclose your personal information to third parties:
        * where it is in our legitimate interests to do so to run, grow and develop our business:
            * if we sell or buy any business or assets, we may disclose your personal information to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets
            * if substantially all of our or any of our affiliates' assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal information held by us will be one of the transferred assets
        * if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal information in order to comply with any legal obligation, any lawful request from government or law enforcement officials and as may be required to meet national security or law enforcement requirements or prevent illegal activity
        * in order to enforce or apply our terms of use, our terms and conditions for customers or any other agreement or to respond to any claims, to protect our rights or the rights of a third party, to protect the safety of any person or to prevent any illegal activity
        * to protect the rights, property, or safety of GB News, our staff, our customers or other persons. This may include exchanging personal information with other organisations for the purposes of fraud protection.
    5. We may also disclose and use anonymised, aggregated reporting and statistics about users of our website and/or app or our goods and services for the purpose of internal reporting or reporting to our group or other third parties, and for our marketing and promotion purposes. None of these anonymised, aggregated reports or statistics will enable our users to be personally identified.
    6. Save as expressly detailed above, we will never share, sell or rent any of your personal information to any third party without notifying you and, where necessary, obtaining your consent. If you have given your consent for us to use your personal information in a particular way, but later change your mind, you should contact us and we will stop doing so.
5. **How long we store your personal information**  
      
    We keep your personal information for no longer than necessary for the purposes for which the personal information is processed. The length of time for which we retain personal information depends on the purposes for which we collect and use it and/or as required to comply with applicable laws and to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights.
6. **Your rights**
    1. You have certain rights in relation to your personal information. If you would like further information in relation to these or would like to exercise any of them, please contact us via email at [community@gbnews.com](mailto:community@gbnews.com) at any time. You have the following rights:
        * **Right of access.** You have a right of access to any personal information we hold about you.

You can ask us for further information on these specific circumstances by contacting us using the details in [section 12](#s12).  
            We will pass your request onto other recipients of your personal information unless that is impossible or involves disproportionate effort. You can ask us who the recipients are, using the contact details in [section 12](#s12).
        * **Right to restrict use of your information**: You have a right to ask us to restrict the way that we process your personal information in certain specific circumstances.

            _We will pass your request onto other recipients of your personal information unless that is impossible or involves disproportionate effort. You can ask us who the recipients are using the contact details in [section 12](#s12)._
        * **Right to stop marketing**: You have a right to ask us to stop using your personal information for direct marketing purposes. If you exercise this right, we will stop using your personal information for this purpose.
        * **Right to data portability**: You have a right to ask us to provide your personal information to a third party provider of services.  
            _This right only applies where we use your personal information on the basis of your consent or performance of a contract; and where our use of your information is carried out by automated means._
        * **Right to object.** You have a right to ask us to consider any valid objections which you have to our use of your personal information where we process your personal information on the basis of our or another person's legitimate interest.
    2. We will consider all such requests and provide our response within a reasonable period (and in any event within one month of your request unless we tell you we are entitled to a longer period under applicable law). Please note, however, that certain personal information may be exempt from such requests in certain circumstances, for example if we need to keep using the information to comply with our own legal obligations or to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
    3. If an exception applies, we will tell you this when responding to your request. We may request you provide us with information necessary to confirm your identity before responding to any request you make.
7. **Children**  
      
    We do not and will not knowingly collect information from any unsupervised child under the age of 13. The website and/or app is not directed at children and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.
8. **Marketing**
    * **Marketing from us**
        * We may collect and use your personal information for undertaking marketing by email telephone and post.
        * We may send you certain marketing communications (including electronic marketing communications) if it is in our legitimate interests to do so for marketing and business development purposes or, if you are a sole trader or a non-limited liability partnership if you have consented to receive such electronic marketing information.
        * However, we will always obtain your consent to direct marketing communications where we are required to do so by law and if we intend to disclose your personal information to any third party for such marketing.
        * Where you have consented to receive marketing communications or email subscriptions from us we may send you information, offers and materials you have requested or we believe may be of interest to you.
        * If you wish to stop receiving marketing communications, you can contact us by email at [community@gbnews.com](mailto:community@gbnews.com) or by changing the settings on your registered user account profile.
    * **Third party advertising**
        * We want to make sure that our advertising and marketing is relevant and interesting to you and our other users. To achieve this, we use third-party advertising and technology companies to serve ads and/or provide aggregated data to assist in serving ads when you visit or use the services. This includes third party technology companies which collect data about you in order to build a profile of your preferences based on your activities when you visit or use the services. We also use these companies to automatically collect data from you when you use the services in order to help us identify the ads that are served to you and what you do after seeing those ads. In addition, we also share data with providers of web analytics tools, such as Google Ad Manager.
        * These third party advertising companies collect, store and use data about you by integrating cookies and other tracking technologies on the Services. Please see our Cookie Policy for further information. In some cases these third parties will also use the data that they collect for their own purposes, for example they may: aggregate your data with other data they hold and use this to inform advertising related services provided to other clients; and work with other advertising companies and share your personal information with such companies as part of the process.
        * You can control how cookies are set on your device \[by opting out of certain cookies on our site\], by using your browser settings and, in some cases, the settings on your mobile device. You can also control your cookie settings with our consent management platform.
9. **Where we may transfer your personal information**
    * Your personal information may be used, stored and/or accessed by staff operating outside the UK or the EEA working for us, other members of our group or suppliers. Further details on to whom your personal information may be disclosed are set out in [section 4](#s4) .
    * If we provide any personal information about you to any such non-UK and non-EEA members of our group or suppliers, we will take appropriate measures to ensure that the recipient protects your personal information adequately in accordance with this privacy policy. These measures may include the following:
        * there is an adequacy decision by the UK in the case of transfers out of the UK, or by the European Commission in the case of transfers out of the EEA, which means that the recipient country is deemed to provide adequate protection for such personal data
        * where the transfer of personal data is to a member of our group, and we have in place binding corporate rules with such member which safeguard the personal data and which have been validated by [the ICO](https://ico.org.uk/) or the relevant supervisory authority
        * where we have in place standard model contractual arrangements with the recipient which have been approved by the European Commission (or the UK in due course). These model contractual clauses include certain safeguards to protect the personal data
10. **Risks and how we keep your personal information secure**
    * The main risk of our processing of your personal information is if it is lost, stolen or misused. This could lead to your personal information being in the hands of someone else who may use it fraudulently or make public, information that you would prefer to keep private.
    * For this reason, GB News is committed to protecting your personal information from loss, theft and misuse. We take all reasonable precautions to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information, including through use of appropriate organisational and technical measures such as encryption, passwords and anti-virus software.
    * In the course of provision of your personal information to us, your personal information may be transferred over the internet. Although we make every effort to protect the personal information which you provide to us, the transmission of information over the internet is not completely secure. As such, you acknowledge and accept that we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our website and that any such transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your personal information, we will use strict procedures and security features to prevent unauthorised access to it.
    * Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access your online account, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.
11. **Links to other websites**  
      
    Our website may contain hyperlinks to websites that are not operated by us. These hyperlinks are provided for your reference and convenience only and do not imply any endorsement of the activities of such third-party websites or any association with their operators. This privacy policy only applies to the personal information that we collect or which we receive from third party sources, and we cannot be responsible for personal information about you that is collected and stored by third parties. Third party websites have their own terms and conditions and privacy policies, and you should read these carefully before you submit any personal information to these websites. We do not endorse or otherwise accept any responsibility or liability for the content of such third party websites or third party terms and conditions or policies.
12. **Changes to our privacy policy**  
      
    We may update our privacy policy from time to time. Any changes we make to our privacy policy in the future will be posted on this page and, where appropriate, notified to you by post or email. Please check back frequently to see any updates or changes to our privacy policy.
13. **Further questions and how to make a complaint**
    * If you have any queries or complaints about our collection, use or storage of your personal information, or if you wish to exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal information, please contact [launch@gbnews.uk](mailto:launch@gbnews.uk). We will investigate and attempt to resolve any such complaint or dispute regarding the use or disclosure of your personal information.
    * You may also make a complaint to [the Information Commissioner's Office](https://ico.org.uk/) or the data protection regulator in the country where you usually live or work, or where an alleged infringement of the General Data Protection Regulation has taken place. Alternatively, you may seek a remedy through the courts if you believe your rights have been breached.
