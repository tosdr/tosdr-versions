GB NEWS COOKIE AND TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES POLICY
-----------------------------------------------

Created: May 2021  

We are GB News Limited registered in England and Wales with company number 12859339 whose registered office is at 2 Swan Lane, London, United Kingdom, EC4R 3TT.

We operate this website and app for GB News in your territory (the "Services"). Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect and use information from and about you when you visit the Services. This cookie policy explains more about how we and certain third parties use cookies and similar technologies on the Services, and your choices concerning them.

**AN EXPLANATION OF THE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES WE USE ON THE SERVICES**

Like many companies, we use cookies and other tracking technologies to ensure you get the best from the Services. Below are some examples of the types of tracking technologies that we may use on the Services.

**Cookies**

“Cookies” are small text files from a website that are stored on your computer, mobile phone or other device. Cookies generally contain information that is associated with your web browser, information such as website preferences, login information, or a user ID. This information enables online services to recognise you as you interact with or revisit their services.

**Other tracking technologies**

Like other online services and mobile applications, we use both cookies and other technologies such as web beacons/GIFs, pixels, page tags, embedded scripts and other tracking technologies. These technologies consist of small transparent image files or other web programming code that record how you interact with the Services. They are often used in conjunction with web browser cookies or other identifiers associated with your device. Below is a more detailed description of some of these other types of tracking technologies we use on the Services:

* Pixels are small images on a web page or in an email. Pixels collect information about your browser or device and can set cookies.
* Local storage allows data to be stored locally on your browser or device and includes HTML5 local storage and browser cache.
* SDKs are blocks of code provided by our partners that may be installed in our mobile applications. SDKs help us understand how you interact with our mobile applications and collect certain information about the device and network you use to access the application. SDKs may collect identifiers associated with your device or our apps.

In this policy, when we refer to "cookies", we are referring to cookies and other tracking technologies, as described above.

**HOW WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES**

We and certain third parties may use cookies when you interact with the Services for a variety of reasons. The types of cookies that are used on the Services fall into one of the following two categories:

**Essential**

Essential cookies are necessary for the Services to function properly and to remain secure. We also use essential cookies to maintain the security and stability of our services. Because these cookies are necessary to the security and functionality of our services, they cannot be switched off.

**Measurement and performance**

Measurement and performance cookies (and similar technologies) – including Google Analytics – allow us to measure how many people have used the Services, and which sections of it are visited most frequently. These cookies also allow us to monitor service performance, such as error messages and how much time it takes for pages and videos to load. This information allows us to ensure the Services is functioning properly and is providing the best experience for our users.

**Advertising**

Advertising cookies are used to build a profile of your interests, to deliver advertising relevant to those interests, to measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, and for the other purposes described in our [consent management platform](#). These cookies are set by us and by our advertising partners. If you do not allow these cookies, you will still see ads, but they may be less relevant to you.

Please note that certain third parties – including our service providers, partners, advertisers and advertising sales agencies – also use cookies on the Services. Third party cookies are usually measurement and performance cookies, or advertising cookies. For example. Google use cookies on our Services and more information on how they place and use cookies can be found at [https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1623328994345000&usg=AOvVaw349p0kxe2BAad-3IMpotIY).

**How long do cookies last?**

Our Services use several types of cookies including:

* Session cookies: Session cookies are created temporarily in your browser's subfolder while you are visiting a website and are automatically deleted when you leave the website.
* Persistent cookies: In contrast to session cookies, persistent cookies are re-activated when you return to the same website, and remain in your browser's subfolder until they expire (usually after 12 months).
* Secure cookies: Secure cookies are a type of cookie which is transmitted over encrypted HTTP connection. When setting the cookie, the Secure attribute instructs the browser that the cookie should only be returned to the application over encrypted connections.
* Third party cookies: A third party cookie is one that is placed on your hard drive by a website from a domain other than the one you are visiting (e.g. when the website features content, such as ads, from a third-party domain). Third party cookies are set so that a site can remember something about you at a later time. These cookies are set by third parties and we do not control how they are set.
* SameSite cookies: SameSite cookies allow servers to assert that a cookie ought not to be sent along with cross-site requests, which provides some protection against cross-site request forgery attacks. SameSite cookies may not be supported by all browsers.

**HOW CAN YOU OBJECT TO COOKIES BEING PLACED ON YOUR DEVICE?**

You can control how cookies are set on your device by using your browser settings and, in some cases, the settings on your mobile device. You can also control your cookie settings with our [consent management platform](#).

**Browser settings**

You can authorise, refuse or disable website cookies by changing your browser settings. If you disable a cookie already installed on your device or browser, it will not be active any more, but it will not disappear from your device or browser until the end of its lifespan.

Each browser is configured differently. You should follow the instructions given by the publisher of your browser. If you use different devices, make sure you configure the settings of the corresponding browser according to your preferences.

**Mobile device settings**

Your mobile device may provide settings that allow you to express the choice not to have information about your use of mobile ads used for interest-based advertising purposes. On your iOS device, this is called “Limit Ad Tracking,” and on your Android device, it is called “Opt out of Ads Personalisation” or “Opt out of interest-based ads.”
