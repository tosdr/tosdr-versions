In the event of any such infringement, we, or one of our affiliated companies, may terminate the agreement with immediate effect, and block your access to the Service and/or terminate any GB News Account you may have and pursue any rights or remedies available to us.

**6\. Ending your right to use the Service**

* Availability and functionality of the Service and Content depends on the quality of your internet connection and device capabilities. Some features of the Service may not be available on all devices or on all operating systems. \[Please visit our Website to see the full list of supported devices and operating system requirements.\]
* To get the best experience and to ensure the Service operates correctly, we recommend that you accept any updates to the Service as and when they become available. This may also require you to update your device operating system. As and when new operating systems and devices are released, we may over time stop supporting older versions. \[You should regularly check our Website to see the full list of currently supported devices and operating system requirements.\]
* Your use of any updates, modifications to, or replacement versions of the Service will be governed by these Terms of Use and any additional terms you agree to when you install such update, modification, or replacement version.

**9\. Our liability to you**

* You have certain legal rights under the laws of your territory. Nothing in these Terms of Use is intended to affect these legal rights and we do not exclude our liability where we are not permitted to do so under the laws of your territory.
* We accept liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or that of our employees and agents. We are also liable for fraud and fraudulent misrepresentation by us or our employees or agents.
* If we breach these Terms of Use we will only be liable for losses which are foreseeable. Losses are foreseeable where they are obvious, or both you and GB News knew they might happen at the time of you agreeing to these Terms of Use.
* We are not responsible for:
    * any use by you of the Service or Content which isn’t authorised by us under these Terms of Use, including any business losses (such as loss of profit or interruption to your business);
    * any malfunction or interruption to the Service or Content due to circumstances outside of our control that prevent us from fulfilling our obligations to you;
    * any lack of functionality or failure to provide any part of the Service or the Content, or any loss of content or data that is due to:
    * your equipment, devices, operating system or internet connection (including malware, viruses or bugs originating from third parties or on any of your devices);
    * your failure to download any update or the most recent published version of the Service, or to meet the compatibility requirements; or
    * the consequences of you changing your equipment, device, operating system or internet connection;
    * incompatibility of any part of the Service or Content with any other software or hardware (including any of your devices); and
    * We can't guarantee that the Service or the Content will be entirely free from bugs or errors or that your access will be free from interruptions (for example there may be downtime for maintenance or updates or any power or server outages or other reasons outside our control), however where we are made aware of technical issues then we will always try to fix them.
    * Other than as set out above, GB News (including without limitation any officer, employee, consultant, agent, shareholder, director of GB News) shall not be liable for any loss or damage suffered by any person or other entity in connection with the Service, the Content or any other basis upon which such party shall interact with GB News, whether direct or indirect and including without limitation any loss arising in connection with any goodwill, business, profit, saving or data howsoever arising and whether caused by breach of contract, tort or otherwise save for any liability specifically accepted above or that cannot be excluded or limited under any relevant law.

**10\. Advertising and third party websites**

* The Service and Content may contain third party advertisements. Each advertiser is responsible for the content, accuracy and completeness of such advertisements and we are not liable to you for any reliance placed by you on any such advertising or for any mistakes, omissions or inaccuracies contained therein.
* The Service may include hyperlinks to other websites that are not owned or controlled by us. We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the availability, content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party websites. You acknowledge and agree that:
    * we will not be liable for any loss or damage which may be incurred by you as a result of the availability of those external third party sites or resources, or as a result of any reliance placed by you on the completeness, accuracy or existence of any advertising, products or other materials on, or available from, such websites or resources; and
    * you agree that you will not involve us in any dispute between you and the third party.
* We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Service and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each other website that you visit.

**11\. Changes to the Service and Content**

* The Content on the Service will change regularly – that means events, articles and programmes may become available whilst other events, articles and programmes will stop being available. The availability of Content may change for various reasons, such as where third party rights-holders withdraw or restrict our right to use that content on the Service, for legal or regulatory reasons or for other reasons beyond our reasonable control. We therefore have the right to add, change or withdraw Content at any time, with or without notice.
* We may make changes to, suspend or discontinue the Service (or any part of the Service) at any time without giving you any notice. Such changes may be made (for example): when we have to remove certain features or functionality and/or stop allowing certain devices or platforms from being able to access the Service. We may also improve, update or enhance the Service from time to time.

**12\. Changes to these Terms of Use**

* We have the right to change these Terms of Use at any time for the following reasons:
    * to improve the Terms of Use, to make them clearer or easier to understand or to have all our customers on the same Terms of Use;
    * to comply with legal or regulatory requirements, such as mandatory laws that apply to us and our agreement with you, or where we are subject to a court order or judgment;
    * where we make changes to the Service in order to improve it, including where we expand the scope of the Service by adding additional features, functionality or Content;
    * we intend to change the way we structure our Service or we reorganise the way we structure or run our business, including to add paid subscriptions, memberships or similar changes; or
    * for security reasons, including where we introduce additional security checks or software to protect our Content or the Service

In addition, we are constantly striving to improve our Service and we cannot foresee what may change in the future. This means we may make changes or additions to these Terms of Use for reasons other than those set out above.

* We will try to provide reasonable advance notice of any material changes to these Terms of Use which may disadvantage you. Please check back from time to time to see if any changes have been made to these Terms of Use. If you do not agree to the modified Terms of Use you must stop using the Service. Your continued use of the Service will be deemed to constitute your acceptance to any such changes.
* The most up to date version of the Terms of Use will always be available on our website and app from their effective date.

**13\. Competitions and prize draws**

From time to time, we may run promotions, competitions and/or prize draws ("Promotions") on the Service. Promotions may have their own terms and conditions, which will be made clear to you before you take part in such Promotion.

The making of a donation does not form a contract between us and a donor unless or until we accept the donation, at which point the terms and conditions set out below will apply. By making a donation a donor agrees that they will be bound by these terms.
* All donors (as individuals) must be aged 18 or over. All donations must be made from funds owned by the donor and by making a donation the donor warrants that: all funds donated are legally able to be donated to us and that the donation will not, nor will it be used for, the purposes of damaging the reputation of, embarrassing, seeking to denigrate or disparage GB News, and that by accepting the donation GB News will not be caused any loss or damage.
* Any funds donated may be used by us in any manner at our discretion to support the work of GB News. Donors may not exercise any influence over editorial (or any other) GB News policy. Donations may be made using GB News payment service providers from time to time and subject to the terms of such payment provider. If any donor wishes to make a donation in excess of £5,000 (whether as a one off or by a number of donations in a 12 month period), please contact us at [community@gbnews.uk](mailto:community@gbnews.uk) and provide a telephone number so that we can telephone you to discuss your donation.
* Any donation once paid to us is non-returnable and non-refundable, save that we may at our discretion and/or in accordance with these terms refuse to accept any donation and return funds, including where we consider that any donation (including having regard to the source of the donation or identity of the donor) is incompatible with GB News values or interests, has been made in bad faith or where it might damage the relationship between GB News and its various stakeholders. GB News is not a registered charity and accordingly donations do not attract tax relief or “gift aid” or any similar benefit. It is a condition of any donation that the donor agrees to provide full contact / personal details or any other information that we may request in connection with the donation, including information to enable us to verify the source of funds and the identity of the donor.
* Donors shall not be entitled to publicise or publish the fact that they have made a donation other than with our consent. All donations are subject to the GB News privacy policy (which may be found [here](https://www.gbnews.com/terms/privacy-policy)) and are confidential, however, the donor agrees that we may from time to time at our discretion publicise the identity of any or some of our donors.
* GB News (including without limitation any officer, employee, consultant, agent, shareholder, director of GB News) shall not be liable for any loss or damage suffered by any donor or other person in connection with a donation or gift, whether direct or indirect and including without limitation any loss arising in connection with any goodwill, business, profit, saving or data howsoever arising and whether caused by breach of contract, tort or otherwise save for any liability for death or personal injury or any other loss or liability that cannot be excluded or limited under any relevant law. No one other than the donor has or may acquire any legal rights in connection with a donation.
* The terms and any non-contractual obligations arising in relation to a donation or gift are governed by English Law and subject to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of England and Wales.
* If you have any questions or complaints in relation to a donation please contact us on community@gbnews.uk.
