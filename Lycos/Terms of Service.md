Legal Information, GENERAL TERMS OF SERVICE, INTRODUCTION, AND TABLE OF CONTENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to the Lycos Network, owned and produced by Lycos, Inc. and its subsidiary and affiliate corporations, successors, and assigns (collectively referred to as "Lycos"). The Lycos Network currently consists of various web pages at or linked to the URLs [www.lycos.com](http://lycos.com/ "Lycos.com"), [www.tripod.com](http://www.tripod.lycos.com/ "Tripod.com"), [www.angelfire.com](http://www.angelfire.lycos.com/ "Angelfire.com"), and [mail.lycos.com](http://mail.lycos.com/lycos/Index.lycos "Lycos Mail") collectively referred to as the "Lycos Network," which may expand or change from time to time. The Lycos Network is currently one of the most visited hubs on the Internet. The Lycos Network provides leading Web search and navigation, communications and personalization tools, great massively-multiplayer real-time games with cash prizes, homepage building, Web community services and more. Integrated, these sites help each individual user locate, retrieve and manage information tailored to his or her personal interests. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new Products and Services (as defined below), including the addition of new Lycos Network properties shall be subject to these Terms of Service.

Lycos makes available a variety of products and services through the Lycos Network (collectively, the "Products and Services") subject to these General Terms of Service ("Terms of Service"). In addition, there are a variety of special products and services offered through the Lycos Network that have separate registration procedures and separate Terms of Service, terms of service, user agreements, or similar legal agreement. When you are using any service or product on the Lycos Network that does not have a separate legal agreement, the Terms of Service set forth here will apply. Lycos also may supplement the Terms of Service with posted guidelines or rules applicable to specific areas of the Lycos Network. In addition, the Lycos Network also may offer other services from time to time that are governed by the terms of service of the respective service partners.

Because the Terms of Service contain legal obligations, please read them carefully.

Please direct any legal questions to:

1. ### ACCEPTANCE
    
    By using the Products and Services, you are agreeing, without limitation or qualification, to be bound by, and to comply with, these Terms of Service and any other supplemental terms and conditions, posted guidelines or rules applicable to any individual Lycos Network web site, Product or Service. All such guidelines and rules are hereby incorporated by reference into the Terms of Service.
    
2. ### CONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS ON USE
    
    Use of the Products and Services is subject to compliance with these Terms of Service. You acknowledge and agree that Lycos may terminate your access to the Lycos Network or to any of the Products and Services should you fail to comply with the Terms of Service or any other guidelines and rules published by Lycos. Any such termination shall be in Lycos's sole discretion and may occur without prior notice, or any notice. Lycos further reserves the right to terminate any user's access to the Lycos Network or to any of the Products and Services for any conduct that Lycos, in its sole discretion, believes is or may be directly or indirectly harmful to other users, to Lycos or its subsidiaries, affiliates, or business contractors, or to other third parties, or for any conduct that violates any local, state, federal, or foreign laws or regulations. Lycos further reserves the right to terminate any user's access to the Lycos Network or to any of the Products and Services for any reason or for no reason at all, in Lycos's sole discretion, without prior notice, or any notice.
    
    In order to use the Products and Services, users must have access to the World Wide Web and must navigate the Internet to [http://www.lycos.com/](http://lycos.com/ "Lycos.com") or another of the URLs associated with the Lycos Network. Be aware that the majority of the Lycos Network is for general audiences, although there are certain areas on the Lycos Network that contain adult or mature content. Where there is mature or adult content, individuals who are less than 18 years of age or are not permitted to access such content under the laws of any applicable jurisdiction may not access such content. There are also other (mainly commerce-related) areas of the Lycos Network not open to persons under 18 years of age. With respect to general audience content, if Lycos learns that anyone under the age of 13 has accessed the Products and Services, Lycos will require verified parental consent, in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"). Certain areas of the Lycos Network, however, may not be available to children under 13 under any circumstances.
    
    Lycos does not discriminate on the basis of age, gender, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, sexual orientation, or any other protected status.
    
3. ### REGISTRATION AND PRIVACY
    
    Certain of the Products and Services will require the user to register and provide certain data. In consideration of use of such Products and Services, in registering and providing such data, you represent and warrant that: (a) the information about yourself is true, accurate, current, and complete (apart from optional items) as required by various Lycos Network registration forms ("Registration Data") and (b) you will maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Lycos has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Lycos has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Products and Services.
    
    All Lycos Network registrations become the exclusive property of Lycos, its affiliates and subsidiaries. Lycos reserves the right to use and reuse all registration and other personally identifiable user information subject to the Lycos Network Privacy Policy. Users may edit, update, alter or obscure their personally identifiable information at any time by following the instructions located in the Lycos Network Privacy Policy and at individual Lycos Network sites.
    
    You acknowledge receipt of [Lycos Network Privacy Policy](http://info.lycos.com/resources/privacy-policy "Lycos Network Privacy Policy"), including our Notice Regarding the Privacy of Children Under 13 While on the Lycos Network.
    
4. ### RESPONSIBILITY FOR MINORS
    
    In cases where you have authorized a minor to use the Products and Services, you recognize that you are fully responsible for: (i) the online conduct of such minor; (ii) controlling the minor's access to and use of the Products and Services; and (iii) the consequences of any misuse by the minor. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SOME AREAS OF THE LYCOS NETWORK MAY CONTAIN MATERIAL THAT IS INAPPROPRIATE FOR MINORS.
    
5. ### PARENTAL CONTROLS AND CHILD SAFETY
    
    Certain material available on the Internet is not appropriate for minors. To prevent or limit your children's access to such materials, a number of parental control protections (such as computer hardware, software, or filtering services) are commercially available. For more information on such parental control protections, [click here](http://info.lycos.com/resources/internet-safety/ "Internet Safety and Security"). To review our Notice Regarding the Privacy of Children Under 13 While on the Lycos Network, [click here](http://info.lycos.com/resources/privacy-policy#a10 "Lycos Network Privacy Policy").
    
6. ### MEMBER AND USER CONDUCT
    
    Upon registering, you will receive a password and Lycos Network ID. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password and ID, and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your password or ID. You agree to (a) immediately notify Lycos of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session. The Lycos Network cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this requirement.
    
    You acknowledge and agree that all information, code, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, pictures, graphics, video, chat, messages, files, or other materials ("Content"), whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, are the sole responsibility of the person from which such Content originated. This means that you, and not the Lycos Network, are entirely responsible for all Content that you upload, post, e-mail or otherwise transmit via the Services. The Lycos Network does not control the user or third party Content posted via the Products and Services, and, as such, does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of such user or third party Content. You acknowledge and Agree that by using the Products and Services, you may be exposed to Content that is offensive, indecent or objectionable. Under no circumstances will the Lycos Network be liable in any way for any user or third party Content, including, but not limited to, for any errors or omissions in any such Content, or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any such Content posted, e-mailed or otherwise transmitted via the Products and Services. As a general matter, Lycos does not pre-screen user or third party Content posted on the Lycos Network, except for certain areas where Lycos employs certain automated screening software, although Lycos reserves the right to do so. Lycos does not guarantee that any screening will be done to your satisfaction or that any screening will be done at all. Lycos reserves the right to monitor some, all, or no areas of the Products and Services for adherence to these Terms of Service or any other rules or guidelines posted by Lycos.
    
    The Products and Services may only be used for the intended purpose for which such Products and Services are being made available. The intended purpose of site building software on the Lycos Network is to maintain, publish and produce web sites on the Lycos Network that are consistent with these Terms of Service.

Without limitation Lycos and its designees shall have the right (but not the obligation), in their sole discretion, to refuse to publish, remove, or block access to any Content that violates the Terms of Service or is otherwise objectionable as determined by Lycos, in its sole discretion. Lycos may also terminate access to, or membership in, the Lycos Network, or any portion thereof, for violating these Terms of Service. You acknowledge and agree that you must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with, the use of any Content, including any reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such Content. In this regard, you acknowledge that you may not rely on any Content created by or obtained through the use of the Lycos Network, including without limitation, information posted on message boards.
    
    You expressly acknowledge and agree that the Lycos Network may preserve Content and may also disclose Content if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process; (b) enforce the Terms of Service; (c) respond to claims that any Content violates the rights of third-parties; or (d) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Lycos, its users and the public. You acknowledge and agree that the technical processing and transmission of the Products and Services, including your Content, may involve (a) transmissions over various networks; and (b) changes to conform and adapt to technical requirements of connecting networks or devices. You further acknowledge and agree that other data collected and maintained by Lycos with regard to its users may be disclosed in accordance with Lycos's [Privacy Policy](http://info.lycos.com/resources/privacy-policy "Lycos Network Privacy Policy").
    
    Lycos also may suspend or terminate any user account for any Product or Service because of user inactivity. For example, a Lycos Mail account may be terminated or suspended if a user fails to sign-in to the Lycos Mail Service for an extended period of time; please see the Lycos Mail Help section for more information regarding Lycos Mail's policies concerning account termination. What is considered "user inactivity" varies depending on the Product or Service. If one of your accounts is suspended or terminated for inactivity, your right to use such Product or Service immediately ceases.
    
7. ### LICENSE TO USER CONTENT
    
    With respect to any Content posted by or in connection with the Products and Services, you grant Lycos a world-wide, royalty free, perpetual, license to use, copy, transmit, publicly display, publicly perform, create compilations including, create derivative works of, and distribute such Content to publish and promote such Content in connection with the particular Products and Services and to publish and promote such Content elsewhere within the Lycos Network. Such license shall apply with respect to any form, media, or technology now known or later developed.
    
8. ### MAIL
    
    Before you register for a Lycos Mail account, you must read and agree to these Terms of Use and the [Lycos Mail Terms of Service](http://info.lycos.com/resources/terms-of-service/mail "Lycos Mail Terms of Service"), including any future amendments.
    
    Lycos offers subscription and unpaid versions of its electronic mail services. For users of the unpaid mail services, Lycos reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to limit the amount of storage space available per user or to delete materials stored for an excessive period while the user's account has been inactive. Specifically, Lycos reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to delete any materials (including e-mails) stored in connection with an unpaid Lycos Mail account if the user's account has been inactive for thirty (30) days. If you subscribe to Lycos Mail, you agree to be bound by the subscription agreement.
    
9. ### WEB PUBLISHING (ANGELFIRE, TRIPOD, DOMAINS)
    
    In General. Lycos offers versions of the Angelfire, and Tripod that are free of charge, exclusive of Internet or other telecommunications and computer equipment charges and fees. Any aspect of such services may be modified by Lycos for any reason or for no reason at all, in Lycos's sole discretion, without prior notice, or any notice. Lycos allows one unpaid Angelfire or Tripod membership, per individual with a legitimate electronic mail address. If a user of the unpaid version of Angelfire, or Tripod does not build a homepage within twenty eight (28) days after registering for such service, Lycos may delete such member's Angelfire, or Tripod account. Lycos also offers subscription versions of the Angelfire, Tripod, and Domains services. If you subscribe to such services, you agree to be bound by the subscription agreement.
    
    Services License. By submitting a web page to the unpaid versions of Angelfire, Tripod, or any other unpaid web page hosting service on the Lycos Network, you grant Lycos a royalty-free, nonexclusive, worldwide, unrestricted license to use, copy, transmit, publicly display, publicly perform, create compilations including, and distribute such web page, and any associated Content, for the limited purposes of publishing and promoting the user's web page in connection with the particular service with which the user has chosen to have the web page hosted and for publishing and promoting such web page elsewhere within the Lycos Network. Such license shall apply with respect to any form, media, or technology now known or later developed. The term of the license will extend only for the duration of the user's membership with the particular Lycos Network service (e.g., Tripod, or Angelfire). In the event that such membership is terminated, Lycos will relinquish all rights to the user's Content as described above following the duration of any applicable promotional activities ongoing at the time the membership is terminated.
    
    Scraping. With certain Web Publishing services, you may make your content available for "scraping." This means that you allow other users to copy your content and to incorporate it into their home pages. If you post content on your home page, and if you make it available for scrapping, you represent and warrant that (a) you are the owner of such content and (b) that the posting of such content by you - and the copying and posting of such content by another user - will not violate the copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret, privacy, publicity, or other right of any party.
    
    Advertisements. You acknowledge and agree that Lycos runs advertisements on the web pages of its users of unpaid services and grant Lycos the right to do so. These advertisements may include, without limitation, "banner" advertisements and "pop-up text" advertisements. The manner, mode, and extent of such advertising are subject to change.
    
    Please read the entire Terms of Service as all Lycos Network properties, Products and Services are subject to these Terms of Service.

12. ### REMOVAL OF LINKS
    
    The Lycos Network occasionally receives requests from people to remove links from the Lycos Network search services. Although the Lycos Network reserves the right to address such requests individually, the general approach that the Lycos Network takes reflects the following principles: The catalogs and databases used in connection with the Lycos Network search services consist of information that has been identified, indexed and compiled through an automated process with no advance review by human beings. Given the enormous volume of web site information added, deleted, and changed on a frequent basis, the Lycos Network cannot and does not screen anything made available through the Lycos Network search services' catalogs and databases. In other instances, the Lycos Network makes available directories, indices, and references consisting of content that has been identified, indexed, and compiled by humans. Furthermore, some of the catalogs and databases that can be searched in the Lycos Network are compiled by third parties through automated processes. However, if the operator of the site does not take steps to prevent it (i.e. make use of the Robots.txt file or Robots Meta tags), the automatic facilities used to create the catalogs and databases are likely to find it and index it again in a relatively short amount of time.
    
13. ### DISCLAIMER REGARDING THIRD PARTY CONTENT
    
    The Lycos Network offers access to numerous third party web pages and content available over the Internet. In overwhelming majority instances, including, but not limited to, sites displayed as search results or contained within a directory of links, Lycos has no control whatsoever over the content of such sites. In other instances, including, but not limited to, web pages hosted on the Lycos Network or provided to the Lycos Network by third parties, Lycos may set guidelines for what may appear on such web pages and may engage in certain screening, but generally exercises no control over the content of such web pages and is unable to police all such content. Third party content accessible through the Lycos Network from such sources is developed by people over whom the Lycos Network exercises no control. The search results that appear from the catalogs indexed by the Lycos Network's spiders or web robots are automated, and the Lycos Network cannot and does not screen the sites before including them in the catalogs from which such automated search results are gathered. Similarly, web pages hosted by the Lycos Network are posted by third parties, and, with the exception of certain automated screening functions, Lycos cannot and does not screen such web pages before they are made accessible to other users of the Lycos Network. Accordingly, neither the Lycos Network nor its licensors assume any responsibility for the content of any site included in any search results or otherwise linked to the Lycos Network web sites or in any web page hosted for a third party within the Lycos Network. In instances where the Lycos Network does review the sites that are displayed in directories, indices, and/or references, or where the Lycos Network makes available directories, indices, and/or references of sites compiled by third parties, the content located at such sites was developed third parties, and review of such sites by Lycos, if any, is narrowly limited to that which is necessary for compiling the particular set of links.
    
14. ### STORAGE
    
    Many features of the Lycos Network store information on behalf of users. Examples include, but are not limited to, e-mail messages, chat, web pages, message boards, and calendar functions. Lycos reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to limit the amount of storage space available per user or to delete materials stored for an excessive period while the user's account has been inactive.
    
15. ### DISCLAIMER REGARDING MULTIMEDIA SEARCH AND OTHER PICTURES, MOVIES, STREAMS AND SOUNDS LOCATED THROUGH THE LYCOS NETWORK SEARCH SERVICES
    
    Pictures, movies, streams, and sounds (the "Multimedia Content") located through the Lycos Multimedia Search and other Lycos Network search services are protected by copyright and/or other intellectual property laws. Lycos does not have the right to authorize you to reproduce, distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or create derivative works from any files containing such Multimedia Content. Where search results link to sites outside the Lycos Network, all of the Multimedia Content contained on such sites is owned and served by entities other than Lycos. The Lycos Network provides you with the URL or address of the Multimedia Content; this information may be used to determine the server of the Multimedia Content. If you intend to make use of any Multimedia Content accessed through our site for commercial or noncommercial purposes, we strongly suggest that you contact the server of the Multimedia Content for permission to use the Multimedia Content.
    
16. ### LYCOS NETWORK IMAGE GALLERY

You agree that Lycos shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings or as the result of the presence of such advertisers on the Product and Services.
    
    Lycos encourages you to exercise discretion while using the Products and Services to browse the Internet. Lycos may produce automated search results or otherwise link you to sites containing information that some people may find inappropriate or offensive. Lycos makes no representations concerning any effort to review the content of any of the sites listed in automated search results, Web Guides or other directories, or of any of the sites otherwise linked to the Lycos Network web sites. Lycos shall not be held responsible for the accuracy, copyright or trademark compliance, legality, or decency of material contained in sites listed in the Lycos Network search results or otherwise linked to the Lycos Network web sites or provided to the Lycos Network by third parties.
