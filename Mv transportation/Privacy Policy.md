#### Your California Privacy Rights

This section of the Privacy Policy applies only to riders and other individual users of our services who reside in the State of California and whose personal information we use for MI’s own business purposes (“California Consumers”).

1. **_Right_ to Know**

California Consumers have the right to submit a verifiable request to know:

* The categories and specific pieces of personal information that MV has collected about them;
* The categories of sources from which MV collected the personal information;
* The categories of personal information that MV sold or disclosed to a third party (other than a service provider) for a business purpose and the categories of recipients of that information; and
* The business or commercial purposes for MP’s collection, disclosure, or sale of the personal information.

1. **Right To Delete**

* California Consumers have the right to submit a verifiable request for deletion of their personal information that MV has collected from the Consumer.

How to Exercise Your Rights

1. **Making Requests**

MV will respond to requests in accordance with applicable law if it can verify the identity of the individual submitting the request. California Consumers can exercise their rights in the following ways:

* Complete the online request form available here: [https://mvtransit.com/contact-us/passenger-feedback](https://mvtransit.com/contact-us/passenger-feedback) and/or [https://mvtransit.com/contact-mvtransit](https://mvtransit.com/contact-mvtransit);
* Contact by telephone: (877) 687-2338

1. **Requests By Authorized Agents**

1. **How We Will Verify Your Requests**

To prevent anyone other than you, or your authorized agent, from exercising the right to know or the right to delete with respect to your personal information, we follow procedures to verify your, or your agent’s, identity. This process seeks to confirm that the person making a request is the person about whom we have collected personal information or that person’s authorized agent. The verification process involves matching data points that you provide with your request against information about you we already have in our records and that we have determined to be reliable for purposes of verifying your identity. We will use information you provide in your completed request form to verify your identity, and we may request additional information if necessary to complete the verification process.

California Consumers have the right not to be subject to discriminatory treatment by MV for exercising their privacy rights under the CCPA, and MV will not discriminate on that basis. However, MV may charge a California Consumer a different price or rate or provide a different level or quality of goods or services if the difference is reasonably related to the value provided to the California Consumer by the Consumer’s Personal Information.If MV does so, it will provide Consumers with any legally required notice.
