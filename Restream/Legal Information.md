GDPR Compliance
===============

### Last modified on 13/09/21

Restream has made commercially reasonable efforts to provide detailed overview of our GDPR compliance and how Restream supports your business to operate within the confines of this regulation. Especially when it comes to customer data and its verification through the Restream Live Video Streaming Service. But it is still advised to engage services of a legal counsel to have a better understanding of GDPR compliance and the liabilities that come along with it for your organization. The following compliance guide is the practices, procedures and upgrades introduced in the internal working of Restream to make its services GDPR complaint.  
  
**Here is a summary of GDPR sections that are applicable to users of Restream services.**  
  
  
**Cookies**  
  
GDPR only allows collection of user data for a legal reason. Restream only collects data for verification purposes as per the legal agreement signed by Restream and its customers in the Terms of Use. This data will be limited to verification of the credentials, identity or any other related verification that was required by our customers to be provided as per the legal agreement.  
  
**Lawful Basis**  
  
GDPR only allows collection of user data for a legal reason. Restream only collects data for verification purposes as per the legal agreement signed by Restream and its customers in the Terms of Use. This data will be limited to verification of the credentials, identity or any other related verification that was required by our customers to be provided as per the legal agreement.  
  
We have even added a consent button at the form where a customer is supposed to fill its identification details. We also provide the option for customers to go through our data protection, privacy policy and Terms & Conditions, to ensure full transparency.  
  
**Deletion**  
  
GDPR requires Restream to forget and delete the user data when requested by the user. Restream has taken steps to provide full control to the end-users about their data that they have submitted for identity verification for login. This can be deleted via their account settings or contacting a Customer Service Representative via chat or email.  
  
**Restream Plan for GDPR Compliance**  
  
Restream Users and Enterprise partners should feel confident that we are both knowledgeable and compliant with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that are under our control. This directive set by the European Union, a legislation that set forth guidelines regarding how information is collected and how it is processed and used.  
  
The GDPR legislation was formed to harmonize data privacy laws across Europe. Empowering all EU citizen’s data privacy in the process, and to reshape how organizations approach data privacy in a secure and transparent manner.  
  
At Restream, we deploy commercially reasonable efforts to assist our users, businesses and our clients. To help them understand, what the GDPR means for their businesses and to assist them in establishing a compliant process of their own. Considering that aspect, we have made great improvements to our Restream platform to ensure that we stand at par with the critical components of GDPR measures.  
  
**The Restream Process:**  
  
Let us say that Daniel Streamer is a potential customer and lives in France. He is called the Data Subject, and the service provider, is called the Controller of his data. Since Restream is verifying the credentials of Daniel, then that makes Restream, the Processor.  
  
**How Daniel might interact with Restream:**  
  

* An Enterprise Ecommerce partner integrates Restream with their online business/portal/app
* Daniel approaches the Online Business and is redirected to a landing page where Restream Verification is carried out.
* Or Daniel goes directly to Restream.io and enters relevant credentials (email Address and password)
* Restream uses STRIPE for payment collections, so Restream does NOT retain any Credit or Debit card info.
* Restream does NOT collect Date of Birth, Physical Address, Social Security Numbers or other overly sensitive PII (Personal Identifiable Information).
* Based on the results of a verification of Daniels username and password only, he is **Verified** or **Not Verified** to use the Restream service.

  
All the above stated steps gather user data from the **Data Subject** on behalf of  
**Controller** that is passed on to **Processor.** Following are various aspects of our data protection policy, privacy policy and Terms & Conditions that control the entire process, under the guidelines of GDPR  
  
**User Data**  
  
User Data means any data, content, code, video, images, or other materials of any type that User uploads, submits or otherwise transmits to or through Services. User will retain all right, title, and interest in and to User Data in the form provided to restream.io. Restream stores data on industry secured servers located in EEA zone, and are monitored. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, you hereby grant to Restream a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free right to:  
  
**(a)** collect, use, copy, store, and transmit User Data (Video, Graphics), in each case solely to the extent necessary to provide the applicable Services to Client  
  
**(b)** Client hereby grants to Restream all necessary rights to use, reproduce, modify, create derivative works from, distribute, perform, transmit and display the User solely to the extent necessary to provide the Services which will include the right for Restream to grant equivalent rights to its service providers that perform services that form part of or are otherwise used to perform the Services.  
  
**Access to Data**  
  
The Services may delete any stored items in storage upon expiration or termination of this Agreement. Restream will have no responsibility or liability for storing and deleting items in accordance with our Terms of Use agreement.  
  
**User Data Collected by Restream**  
  
You may instruct us to provide you with any personal information we hold about you; Restream only collects the following information (mostly nonapplicable to GDPR):  

* ip address
* username
* password (hash encrypted)
* email address
* timezone created\_at time
* google\_token
* blog\_posts\_read
* stripe\_id for Restream to verify payment was made for accessing the service
* selected\_language
* two\_factor\_auth

  
In practice, you will usually either expressly agree in advance to our use of your personal information for marketing purposes, or we will provide you with an opportunity to opt out of the use of your personal information for Restream marketing purposes. Restream DOES NOT SELL any user data.  
  
**Automated decision-making**  
  
We may use your personal data for the purposes of automated decision-making in relation to our live video stream service. This automated decision-making will involve checking the info provided by you and matching that with the identity information provided by you.  
  
**Identity Verification**  
  
Restream employs simple user named accounts, email address and password only. Unless otherwise stated in the Standard Agreement, the Verifications parameters include:  

* User Name
* Email address
* Customized Service parameters (Paid Plans)

  
**Users Individual Rights Request**  
  
The GDPR enhances the rights of individuals in several ways.  
  
**Access and Privileges**  
  
User can request access to the personal data they have shared with Restream about their account. Personal data is anything identifiable, like his name and email address. If they requests access, Restream (as the processor) will provide a copy of the data, in most cases in machine-readable format (e.g. CSV or XLS).  
  
A client can seek access to their data by asking Restream of what they require at [legal@restream.io](mailto:legal@restream.io). We at Restream believe to be at legal and moral obligation to facilitate any manner of an individual rights request.  
  
**Modification**  
  
In the manner same as accessing information, user can request Restream to modify their personal data, if it is inaccurate, incomplete or requires any sort modification or amendment.  
  
The GDPR requires that a company be able to accommodate modification requests, as and when required.  
  
**Deletion**  
  
Under the GDPR, users have the right to request that Restream **delete all personal data** it has collected from them. GDPR requires Restream to permanently remove users contact from their database, including verification results, all personal information, saved images/video, form submission data and credit card data.  
  
In a GDPR compliant manner, a client can seek to have their data deleted by querying Restream at [legal@restream.io](mailto:legal@restream.io). The Data protection officer at Restream will respond back within a 30-day period.  
  
**DATA PROCESSING AGREEMENT**  
  
**1\. BACKGROUND**  
  
Restream Inc. provides Restream Live Video Streaming Services for EU based enterprises that can provide accounts for employees and other individuals. According to the GDPR such process requires the implementation of data processing agreement ( **“DPA”** ) and, in case of international transfers, standard contractual clauses ( **“SCC” or “UK SCC”** ) between the Processor and the Controller.

This is based on the understanding that laws that respect the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms do not exceed what is necessary and proportionate in a democratic society to safeguard one of the objectives listed in Article 23(1) GDPR, are not in contradiction with the clauses.  
  
4.2. The parties declare that they have taken due account in particular of the following elements: (i) the specific circumstances of the transfer, including the content and duration of the contract; the scale and regularity of transfers; the length of the processing chain, the number of actors involved and the transmission channels used; the type of recipient; the purpose of processing; the nature of the personal data transferred; any relevant practical experience with prior instances, or the absence of requests for disclosure from public authorities received by the data importer for the type of data transferred; (ii) the laws of the United States, including those requiring to disclose data to public authorities or authorizing access by such authorities, as well as the applicable limitations and safeguards; (iii) any safeguards in addition to those under these clauses, including the technical and organizational measures applied during transmission and to the processing of the personal data in the United States.  
  
4.3.

Restream agrees to promptly notify the Client if, after having agreed to these clauses and for the duration of the DPA, it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws not in line with the requirements, including following a change of the laws the United States a measure (such as a disclosure request) indicating an application of such laws in practice that is not in line with the requirements under paragraph 3.1.  
  
4.5. If the Client otherwise has reason to believe that Restream can no longer fulfil its obligations under the clauses, the Client shall promptly identify appropriate measures (such as, for instance, technical or organizational measures to ensure security and confidentiality) to be adopted by the Client and / or Restream to address the situation, if appropriate in consultation with the competent supervisory authority. If the Client decides to continue the transfer, based on its assessment that these additional measures will allow Restream to fulfill its obligations under the clauses, the Client shall forward the notification to the competent supervisory authority together with an explanation, including a description of the measures taken. The Client shall suspend the data transfer if it considers that no appropriate safeguards for such transfer can be ensured, or if instructed by the competent supervisory authority to do so.

**5\. Obligations of the Processor in case of government access requests**  
  
5.1. Restream agrees to promptly notify the Client and, where possible, the data subject (if necessary with the help of the Client) if it: (i) receives a legally binding request by a public authority under the laws of the country of the United States for disclosure of personal data transferred pursuant to these clauses; such notification shall include information about the personal data requested, the requesting authority, the legal basis for the request and the response provided; (ii) becomes aware of any direct access by public authorities to personal data transferred pursuant to these clauses in accordance with the laws of the United States; such notification shall include all information available to Restream.

5.3. To the extent permissible under the laws of the United States, Restream agrees to provide to the Client, in regular intervals for the duration of the DPA, the greatest possible amount of relevant information on the requests received (in particular, number of requests, type of data requested, requesting authority or authorities, whether requests have been challenged and the outcome of such challenges, etc.).  
  
5.4. Restream agrees to preserve the information for the duration of the DPA and make it available to the competent supervisory authority upon request.  
  
5.5. Clauses 4.1 to 4.3 are notwithstanding the obligation of Restream to promptly inform the Client where it is unable to comply with these clauses.  
  
**6\. Review of legality and data minimization**
