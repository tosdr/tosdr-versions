To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, the USA PATRIOT Act requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person (including business entities) who opens an account.

What this means to you: When you open an account, we will ask for your name, physical address, date of birth, taxpayer identification number and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see your driver's license or other identifying documents. We will let you know if additional information is required.

The Sites and bank products and services are offered and hosted in the United States and subject to U.S. law, and are intended for users located only in the U.S. If you are accessing the Sites or bank products and services from outside the United States, please be advised that U.S. law may not offer the same privacy protections as the laws of your jurisdiction. By accessing and using the Sites or bank products and services, you consent to the transfer to and processing of your personal information in the U.S.

**California resident privacy rights:**

If you are a California resident, California law may provide you with additional rights regarding our use of your personal information; subject to exclusions from the rights granted under California law with respect to certain information governed by certain sector-specific privacy laws, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) or the California Financial Information Privacy Act (FIPA).

California Rights

Subject to any exceptions under applicable law, California residents have the following rights with respect to their personal information:

* The right to know and access. A California resident may have the right to request we provide them with (i) a copy of the personal information that we have collected or maintained about them during any specific period of time; (ii) the categories of personal information that we have collected or maintained about them during any specific period of time; (iii) the categories of purposes for which such personal information was disclosed during any specific period of time; (iv) the categories of sources of such personal information that was collected during any specific period of time; and (v) the categories of third parties that such personal information may have been shared with during any specific period of time. If you exercise your right to know or access, we will work to provide you with the information requested for the specific time period requested. If you choose to exercise your right to know or access and do not specify a time period, we will work to provide all of the requested information collected or maintained after January 1, 2023, unless doing so would be impossible or involve a disproportionate effort. In the case that fulfilling a request to know or access proves impossible or involves a disproportionate effort, we will work to provide you the requested categories of information collected or maintained by us in the immediately preceding twelve (12) months from the date of your request.
* The right to deletion. A California resident may have the right to request that we delete the personal information that we or our vendors collected about them. There may be circumstances under which we will be unable to delete their personal information, such as if we need to comply with our legal obligations or complete a transaction for which their personal information was collected. If we are unable to comply with a California resident’s request for deletion, we will let them know the reason why.
* The right to correct inaccurate personal information**.** A California resident may have the right to request that any of their inaccurate personal information that is maintained by us be corrected, taking into account the nature of the personal information and the purposes of the processing of the personal information.
* The right to portability. A California resident may have the right to request that we transmit their personal information to another entity in a portable, easily understandable, and to the extent technically feasible, in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable, and readily usable format.
* The right not to receive discriminatory treatment. A California resident has the right to not receive discriminatory treatment by FNBO for the exercise of the privacy rights conferred under California law. We will not discriminate against a California resident for exercising any of their rights.

Exercising Your Rights

To exercise a right described above, a California resident may **[click here to submit a verifiable consumer request](https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/4afdbafe-66e2-4d19-9bd0-e07833456b8d/6762f8d7-8b4c-4db1-8613-29fae2bf6f50)** or call our toll-free number: 855-578-8488. We will work to confirm receipt of your request within ten (10) days of receiving your request.

Only a California resident, or someone legally authorized to act on such California resident’s behalf, may make a consumer request related to their personal information. In connection with submitting a request, we may require you to provide certain of the identifiers noted above and your relationship status. In general, we have the right to require you to provide written permission granting authority to your representative and for your agent to verify its identity directly with us, and we may deny a request from your representative who does not submit proof of authorization as we request.

A California resident may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a twelve (12) month period. The verifiable consumer request must provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify the requestor is the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative and describe the request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. We cannot respond to a request or provide personal information if we cannot verify the identity or authority to make the request.

We will work to confirm receipt of a request within ten (10) days following submission and provide information about how we will process the request. We will work to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to an additional forty-five (45) days), we will provide notice in writing explaining the reason for the extended time period.

Making a verifiable consumer request does not require a California resident to create an account with us. We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.

We may deny your request to exercise any of the rights listed herein if we have a good-faith, reasonable, and documented belief that such request is fraudulent.

Selling or Sharing under California Law

In the preceding twelve (12) months, we have not sold or shared and will not sell or share, each as defined by California law, California resident personal information, including the personal information of California residents under sixteen (16) years of age, for money or other valuable consideration. The foregoing statement is subject to certain exclusions governed by sector-specific privacy laws, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) or the California Financial Information Privacy Act (FIPA).

Sensitive Personal Information

While we may collect and store personal information that would be considered sensitive personal information under California law, we will not use or disclose sensitive personal information except (i) to perform the services or provide the goods requested; (ii) to prevent, detect, and investigate security incidents that compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity or confidentiality of stored or transmitted personal information; (iii) to resist malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal actions and to prosecute those responsible for those actions; (iv) to ensure the physical safety of natural persons; (v) for short-term, transient use; (vi) to verify or maintain the quality or safety of any of our products, services, or devices and to improve, upgrade, or enhance any of our products, services or devices; or (vii) for purposes that do not infer characteristics about a California resident.
