Use of Information
------------------

The use of your information is subject to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use in effect at the time of use. The provisions contained herein supersede all previous notices or statements regarding our privacy practices with respect to this Site.

We may use aggregated data (independent of any personal identifiers) for research and commercial purposes. This information includes what areas our users visit most frequently and what services they access most often. This information helps us develop better sites and services that are more useful and accessible to you.

We may use your PII for our general commercial purposes including, among other things, to conduct internal research for expansion of our products and services. We may retain service providers to carry out such research on our behalf, and in such cases we enter into specific data protection and confidentiality terms with those agents to ensure they protect your personal data to the same levels as Justworks. We may use your PII to offer our own, our affiliates’ or third-party products and services that we think you may find of interest, but only Company, its subsidiaries and its service providers involved in distributing the offers or providing the products or services will have access to your PII. Our subsidiaries and service providers will be required to use any PII we provide them only for that intended purpose.

We may use your email address to contact you to respond to your inquiries or to provide information on products or services to you, or to carry out survey or other research for the purposes of understanding your customer or user experience, improving, or expanding our products and services.

Disclosing Your Information
---------------------------

We may reveal PII about you to unaffiliated third parties: (1) if you request or authorize it; (2) if the information is provided to help complete a transaction for you; (3) if the information is provided to comply with the law, applicable regulations, governmental and quasi-governmental requests, court orders or subpoenas, to enforce our Terms of Use or other agreements, or to protect our rights, property or safety or the rights, property or safety of our users or others (e.g., to a consumer reporting agency for fraud protection etc.); (4) if the disclosure is done as part of a purchase, transfer or sale of services or assets (e.g., in the event that substantially all of our assets are acquired by another party, customer information may be one of the transferred assets); (5) if the information is provided to our agents, outside vendors or service providers to perform functions on our behalf (e.g., gathering and analyzing data, providing marketing assistance and research assistance, providing customer service, processing payroll or taxes, etc.); or (6) as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.

We may disclose your non-private, aggregated, or otherwise non-personal Information, such as usage statistics of our Products, to our affiliates and third parties.

Company gives you the ability to amend your data at any time by accessing your account on our site (by clicking on the “account details” tab link on the home page), modifying the information on your account page, \[etc.\]. Any changes will affect only future uses of your PII.

Subject to any legislation which might, from time to time, oblige us to store the information for a certain period of time, we will respect your wishes to correct inaccurate information.

If you are not able to provide proof of your identity, we reserve the right to refuse to send you any PII. We will respond as quickly as we can to your requests for details of PII we hold about you.

Security
--------

We have security measures in place in our physical facilities and in our computer systems, databases, and communications networks that are designed reasonably to protect information contained within our systems from loss, misuse or alteration.

No method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee absolute security of your PII. You also play a role in protecting your information.

You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security. We reserve the right to refuse service, terminate accounts, or remove or edit content in our sole discretion.

California Privacy Rights
-------------------------

Consumers in California have the right to request disclosure of personal information collected about them, including the categories of personal information collected, the categories of sources from which personal information is collected, the business or commercial purpose for collecting personal information, the categories of personal information disclosed for a business purpose, and the categories of third parties to whom personal information is disclosed. Subject to limitations, consumers in California may request access to or the deletion of specific pieces of personal information collected about them. Please review the “Contacting Us” section below to submit a request. Justworks does not discriminate against consumers for making requests under this section.
