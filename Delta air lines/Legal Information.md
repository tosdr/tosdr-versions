[Generally Applicable Provisions](#expander-image-panel-s_expander_118515418_0)

**Notice of Incorporated Terms**

Air transportation is subject to the individual contract terms (including rules, regulations, tariffs and conditions) of transporting air carriers, which are incorporated by reference into every ticket for travel and made part of the Contract of Carriage. Incorporated terms may include, but are not restricted to:

* limits on liability for personal injury or death.
* limits on liability for baggage, including fragile or perishable goods and availability of excess valuation coverage.
* claims restrictions, including time periods in which passengers must file a claim or bring action against the carrier.
* rights of the air carrier to change terms of the contract.
* rules on reconfirmation of reservations, check-in times, and refusal to carry.
* rights of the air carrier and limits on liability for delay or failure to perform service, including
* schedule changes, substitution of alternate air carriers or aircraft, and rerouting.

You can obtain additional information on items 1 through 6 above at any U.S. location where the transporting air carrier's tickets are sold. You have the right to inspect the full text of each transporting air carrier's rules at its airport and city ticket offices. You also have the right, upon request, to receive free of charge the full text of the applicable terms incorporated by reference from each of the transporting air carriers. Information on ordering the full text of each carrier's terms is available at any U.S. location where the air carrier's tickets are sold.

**Changes to Contract Terms**

Delta reserves the right to amend its Contract of Carriage at any time. Your travel will be governed by the rules that were in effect on the date you purchased your ticket, although Delta reserves the right to apply rules currently in effect on the date of your travel where reasonably necessary for operational reasons and where the change in rule does not have a material negative impact upon you. Delta ticket agents and employees cannot modify the terms of the contract without authority from a corporate officer.

**Domestic Baggage Limitations**

For travel entirely within the USA, liability for loss, damage or delay in delivery of baggage is limited to $3,500 per ticketed passenger unless a higher value is declared in advance and additional charges are paid. Carrier assumes no responsibility for fragile or perishable items.

Note: Rules governing limitations on Delta's liability for lost, damaged, or delayed baggage, and your responsibilities for timely notification in the event of lost, damaged, or delayed baggage vary depending upon the nature of your travel. Contact a Delta agent for details.

**Time Limitation for Baggage Claims:**

Domestic

Any claim for delay, loss, damage to baggage is barred unless notice of the claim is presented to Delta within 24 hours after the occurrence of the events giving rise to the claim, and written notice is received by Delta within 21 days of the occurrence. Any action must be commenced within one year after the occurrence.

International

Any claim for delay, loss or damage to baggage is barred unless notice of the claim is presented in writing to Delta within seven days (in the case of damage) or 21 days (in the case of delay or loss) after the occurrence of the events giving rise to the claim. Any action must be commenced within two years after the occurrence.

**Airline Partners**

Delta Connection carriers are regional airlines which use Delta flight numbers 3600-6799. Flights carrying a "DL" designator that are operated by partner airlines are known as "codeshare" flights. Check with Delta for additional information.

**Check-in Requirements**

Reservations and boarding passes/authorities may be canceled, and passengers may not be eligible for denied boarding compensation if they fail to comply with applicable check-in requirements for their flights. For more information, see [**Check-in Requirements**](https://www.delta.com/us/en/check-in-security/check-in-time-requirements).

Your onward and/or return reservations may be canceled for failure to:

* Meet the check-in requirements listed above
* Fly each segment of your itinerary 

**Currencies on Delta.Com**

All dollar currencies reflected on delta.com are in U.S. Dollars (USD) except where otherwise noted.

**Identification**

For your safety Delta requires that all passengers 18 years of age and older present positive identification for travel. Acceptable forms of positive identification include either:

* One form of photo ID issued by a federal, state, or local government agency, or
* Two forms of non-photo identification, one of which must be issued by a federal, state, or local government agency.

Note: Passengers without identification may be denied transportation.

**Smoking and Smokeless Cigarettes**

Delta is a smoke-free airline. Use of tobacco products is prohibited on all Delta-operated or Delta Connection carrier flights system-wide.

While electronic cigarettes (or e-cigarettes) are marketed as a healthier alternative to smoking and are used to assist users in their efforts to quit smoking, the use of electronic, simulated smoking materials including cigarettes, pipes and cigars, is prohibited on all Delta flights. However, they are only permitted in a passenger's carry-on luggage for all Delta/Delta Connection flights.

**Notice to Passengers Regarding Interference with Security Screening Personnel**

Pursuant to 49 U.S. Code § 46503, individuals in an area within a commercial service airport in the United States may face criminal liability (including fines and/or imprisonment for no more than 10 years) for assaulting a Federal, airport, or air carrier employee who has security duties within the airport, interfering with the performance of the duties of the employee or lessening the ability of the employee to perform those duties.  If the individual uses a dangerous weapon in committing the assault or interference, the individual may be imprisoned for any term of years or life imprisonment.

**Notice to Passengers Regarding Interference with Airport Customer Service Employees**

Passengers are advised that federal law protects airport customer service employees from verbal abuse or physical assault by customers. Implemented pursuant to Section 551 of Public Law 115-254, the [**FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018**](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/302), Delta’s Employee Assault Prevention and Response Plan (“EAPRP”) provides our airport customer service employees the policies, practices and information necessary to prevent, handle and report physical assault and verbal abuse of customer service employees. Delta is committed to complying fully with these requirements as well as all applicable laws and regulations.

**Solicitation of Employees and Passengers**

Except for Delta-sponsored activities or as otherwise permitted by Delta policy, solicitation of Delta employees or passengers is not permitted while on Delta aircraft or otherwise on Delta premises, including, but not limited to, distribution of literature, leaflets, petitions, advertising or any other material. 

**Refusal to Transport**

Delta's conditions of carriage permit Delta to refuse to transport passengers when:

* Compliance with government regulations or directives is required.
* Advisable due to weather or other conditions beyond Delta's control.
* Passenger refuses to submit to a search or produce proper identification.
* Passenger lacks necessary documentation for international travel.
* Passenger fails to comply with any of Delta's rules or regulations or any term of the Contract of Carriage.

Reasonably necessary for the passenger's comfort or safety, for the comfort or safety of other passengers or Delta employees, or for the prevention of damage to the property of Delta or its passengers or employees. For specific examples, see our **[Contract of Carriage](https://www.delta.com/us/en/legal)**.

Delta will not refuse transport based on a passenger's:

* Disability, except on the basis of safety or where transporting the passenger would violate the Federal Aviation Regulations.
* Race, color, national origin, religion, sex, or ancestry.

**Notice of Overbooking of Flights**

Airline flights may be overbooked, and there is a slight chance that a seat will not be available on a flight for which a person has a confirmed reservation. If the flight is overbooked, no one will be denied a seat until airline personnel first ask for volunteers willing to give up their reservation in exchange for a payment of the airline's choosing. If there are not enough volunteers, the airline will deny boarding to other persons in accordance with its particular boarding priority.

With few exceptions, persons denied boarding involuntarily are entitled to compensation. The complete rules for the payment of compensation and each airline's boarding priorities are available at all airport ticket counters and boarding locations. Some airlines do not apply these consumer protections to travel from some foreign countries, although other consumer protections may be available. Check with your airline or your travel agent.

**Liability for Delay or Cancellation**

We will exercise reasonable efforts to carry you and your baggage according to our published schedules and the schedule reflected on your ticket, but published schedules, flight times, aircraft type, seat assignments, and similar details reflected in your ticket or Delta's published schedules are not guaranteed and form no part of this contract. Delta may substitute alternate carriers or aircraft, delay or cancel flights, change seat assignments, and alter or omit stopping places shown on the ticket at any time.

If the change is due to circumstances beyond our control, we will have no liability to you other than to refund your ticket price. If the change is due to circumstances within our control, then we will transport you to your destination on our next available flight (or substitute alternative transportation at our discretion) and, depending upon the circumstances, you may be entitled to a partial refund and/or we may provide you with meals, lodging and/or ground transportation to accommodate you during the delay.

**Advice to International Passengers on Limitations of Liability**

Passengers on a journey involving an ultimate destination or a stop in a country other than the country of departure are advised that international treaties known as the Montreal Convention, or its predecessor, the Warsaw Convention, including its amendments, may apply to the entire journey, including any portion thereof within a country. For such passengers, the treaty, including special contracts of carriage embodied in applicable tariffs, governs and may limit the liability of the Carrier in respect of death or injury to passengers, and for destruction or loss of, or damage to, baggage, and for delay of passengers and baggage.

The names of carrier’s party to such special contracts are available at all ticket offices of such carriers and may be examined upon request.

The applicable limits of liability for your international journey on a flight ticketed by this carrier are:

* The financial limits for any damages, including recoverable compensatory damages sustained in the case of death or bodily injury of a passenger, shall not exceed 128,821 Special Drawing Rights for each passenger, except as expressly set forth in Rule 18(B) of Delta’s International General Rules Tariff.
* In the case of destruction, loss of, or damage or delay to baggage, 1,288 Special Drawing Rights.

Rights are per passenger in most cases. You may benefit from a higher limit of liability for loss of, damage or delay to baggage by making at check-in a special declaration of the value of your baggage and paying any supplementary fee that may apply. Alternatively, if the value of your baggage exceeds the applicable limit of liability, you should fully insure it before you travel.

* In the case of delay to your journey, 5,346 Special Drawing Rights per passenger.

If your mobility aid or wheelchair is destroyed or lost, we will repair or replace it with a comparable model. With respect to mobility aids and wheelchairs, we do not enforce the maximum liability amounts set out in the Montreal Convention, or its predecessor, the Warsaw Convention, as stated in **[Delta’s International General Rules Tariff](https://www.delta.com/us/en/legal/contract-of-carriage-igr)** or **[Canadian General Rules Tariff](https://www.delta.com/us/en/legal/contract-of-carriage-cgr)** (whichever applies to your journey).

If your journey also involves carriage by other airlines, you should contact them for information on their limits of liability.

[Colombia – Right to Withdraw or Retract Ticket Purchase](#expander-image-panel-expander_1595710501__0)

1) Withdrawal

Article 1878 of the Colombia Commercial Code may provide additional protections to passengers traveling to or from Colombia:

Passengers may withdraw from a purchased ticket before departure by notifying Delta or the travel agency that issued the ticket at least twenty-four (24) hours before commencement of the flight. Delta or the travel agency, in accordance with the fare rules, may retain a charge, which may not exceed 10% of the ticket price excluding fees, taxes and administrative fees. For nonrefundable tickets purchased during the COVID emergency, the remainder of the ticket price will be returned to the Passenger in the form of a voucher.  Unless stated otherwise by Delta, the Passenger’s right to withdraw does not apply to promotional fares, in which case it will be applied in accordance with the conditions offered.

Vouchers will be processed within five (5) business days of the withdrawal request.  If the Passenger withdraws their ticket in accordance with the protocols above and the Passenger is entitled to a refund instead of a voucher, Delta or travel agency that issued the ticket will initiate a refund within five (5) business days following Passenger’s request. The refund will be completed within thirty calendar days from the Passenger’s withdrawal request.

2) Retraction For Sales through Non-Traditional and Distance-Selling Methods

In contracts for the provision of the passenger air carriage services formalized through the sales mechanisms referred to in Decree 1499 of 2014, the Purchaser’s right to retraction from the ticket sale applies, subject to the following conditions:

(a) It must be exercised through Delta’s customer service channels, within five (5) business days following the purchase transaction. Flights purchased within five (5) business days before the scheduled departure are excluded from the right to withdraw. 

(c) It applies to only sales made using non-traditional or distance-selling methods referred to in Decree 1499 of 2014.

The retraction will terminate the ticket and contract of carriage.  For nonrefundable tickets purchased during the COVID emergency, the remainder of the ticket price will be returned to the Passenger in the form of a voucher.  Vouchers will be processed within five (5) business days of the retraction request.  If the Passenger withdraws their ticket in accordance with the protocols above and the Passenger is entitled to a refund instead of a voucher, Delta or travel agency that issued the ticket will initiate a refund within five (5) business days following Passenger’s request. Airport taxes will be refunded as part of the retraction, but other fees, taxes or contributions that are nonrefundable will not be refunded. The refund will be completed within thirty (30) calendar days from the Passenger’s retraction request.

For the avoidance of doubt, Delta does not engage in any non-traditional methods, as defined in Decree 1499 of 2014, for the sale of airline tickets in Colombia.

[Dominican Republic Tourism Tax Refunds](#expander-image-panel-_expander_1595710501_0)

[European Notice](#expander-image-panel-s_expander_262131176_0)

**Air carrier liability for passengers and their baggage**

As an air carrier within the meaning of European Regulation (EC) No. 2027/97 (as amended by Regulation (EC) No 889/2002), Delta Air Lines is under the obligation to make available a summary of the main provisions governing liability for passengers and their baggage, including deadlines for filing an action for compensation and the possibility of making a special declaration for baggage, to passengers at all points of sale, including via the internet in relation to carriage to, from or within the European Community. Please see below for a summary of the relevant provisions. In addition, more detail can be found in our **[International Contract of Carriage](https://www.delta.com/us/en/legal/contract-of-carriage-igr)**.

**Compensation in the case of death or injury**

There are no financial limits to the liability for passenger injury or death. For damages up to 113100 SDRs (approximate amount in local currency\*) the air carrier cannot contest claims for compensation. Above that amount, the air carrier can defend itself against a claim by proving that it was not negligent or otherwise at fault.

**Advance payments**

If a passenger is killed or injured, the air carrier must make an advance payment, to cover immediate economic needs, within 15 days from the identification of the person entitled to compensation. In the event of death, this advance payment shall not be less than 16000 SDRs (approximate amount in local currency\*).

**Passenger delays**

In case of passenger delay, the air carrier is liable for damage unless it took all reasonable measures to avoid the damage or it was impossible to take such measures. The liability for passenger delay is limited to 4694 SDRs (approximate amount in local currency\*).

**Baggage delays**

In case of baggage delay, the air carrier is liable for damage unless it took all reasonable measures to avoid the damage or it was impossible to take such measures. The liability for baggage delay is limited to 1131 SDRs (approximate amount in local currency\*).

**Destruction, loss or damage to baggage**

The air carrier is liable for destruction, loss or damage to baggage up to 1131 SDRs (approximate amount in local currency\*). In the case of checked baggage, it is liable even if not at fault, unless the baggage was defective. In the case of unchecked baggage, the carrier is liable only if at fault.

**Higher limits for baggage**

A passenger can benefit from a higher liability limit by making a special declaration at the latest at check-in and by paying a supplementary fee.

**Complaints on baggage**

If the baggage is damaged, delayed, lost or destroyed, the passenger must write and complain to the air carrier as soon as possible. In the case of damage to checked baggage, the passenger must write and complain within seven days, and in the case of delay within 21 days, in both cases from the date on which the baggage was placed at the passenger's disposal.

**Liability of contracting and actual carriers**

If the air carrier actually performing the flight is not the same as the contracting air carrier, the passenger has the right to address a complaint or to make a claim for damages against either. If the name or code of an air carrier is indicated on the ticket, that air carrier is the contracting air carrier.

**Time limit for action**

Any action in court to claim damages must be brought within two years from the date of arrival of the aircraft, or from the date on which the aircraft ought to have arrived.

**Basis for the information**

The basis for the rules described above is the Montreal Convention of 28 May 1999, which is implemented in the Community by Regulation (EC) No 2027/97 (as amended by Regulation (EC) No 889/2002) and national legislation of the Member States."

**Disclaimer**

This is a notice required by European Community Regulation (EC) No 2027/97 (as amended by Regulation (EC) No 889/2002). This notice cannot be used as a basis for a claim for compensation, nor to interpret the provisions of the Regulation or the Montreal Convention, and it does not form part of the contract between the carrier(s) and you. No representation is made by the carrier(s) as to the accuracy of the contents of this notice.

[Israel – Consumer Protection Law](#expander-image-panel-s_expander_681761009_0)

According to the Israeli Consumer Protection Law, 5741-1981, sales transactions which take place in Israel may be cancelled within fourteen (14) days of the transaction date, but not less than seven (7) working days before the departure date of the first flight of an itinerary.  “Sales transactions” include the purchase of (i) “non-refundable” tickets in all classes of service, including Basic Economy, that are to/from Israel (“**Standalone Tickets**”), (ii) any ancillary services separately purchased in connection with such non-refundable tickets (“**Separate Ancillaries**”), and (iii) any “package”, “bundled”, or “flexible” non-refundable tickets, where ancillary services are included in the price of the ticket, in all classes of service, including Basic Economy, that are to/from Israel (“**Flexible Tickets**”).

Cancellation of the booking (and any related ancillary services purchased in connection with the booking) and a claim for refund must be submitted in writing.  Where a passenger has purchased:

*  A Standalone Ticket and related Separate Ancillaries, the passenger may cancel one or more related Separate Ancillaries without being required to cancel all related Separate Ancillaries or the underlying Standalone Ticket. 
*  A Flexible Ticket, the passenger may only cancel the full Flexible Ticket (and not any individual ancillary services included as part of the Flexible Ticket).

If the conditions listed above are satisfied, a refund will be credited to the passenger's account, less a “**Cancellation Fee**”.  This Cancellation Fee is the lesser of (i) five percent (5%) of the total fare of each cancelled ticket (including, in the case of Standalone Tickets, the fees for any Separate Ancillaries associated with the Standalone Ticket that are being canceled), or (ii) NIS 100 per ticket. 

As it relates to Cancellation Fees associated with Separate Ancillaries, where a cancelled booking includes multiple passengers and Separate Ancillaries purchased as part of the same booking, this Cancellation Fee will apply to each passenger under the booking, unless the Separate Ancillaries are purchased by one passenger.  In that case, the Cancellation Fee associated with those Separate Ancillaries will be setoff against the refund for that specific passenger only. 

The Israeli Consumer Protection Law ("**CPL"**) and Consumer Protection Regulations ("**CPR**") both provide for extended refund periods following purchase that supersede DL's ticketing restrictions.

[Japan - Traveling from Japan - Electronic Devices Containing Lithium Batteries](#expander-image-panel-_expander_1559503600_0)

Portable Electronic Devices Containing Lithium Batteries as Checked Baggage

Portable electronic devices with built-in lithium or lithium-ion batteries (laptops, smartphones, tablets, etc.) should be transported in carry-on baggage when possible, and not placed in checked baggage. 

When it is not possible to transport such devices in carry-on baggage:

Enforced by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism of Japan, for flights departing from airports in Japan, portable electronic devices with built-in lithium or lithium ion batteries carried as checked baggage must be:

* Completely switched off (not in sleep mode).
* Packed in a rigid suitcase or wrapped in cushioned material such as clothes. This will help to prevent the items from unintentional activation or damage.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
