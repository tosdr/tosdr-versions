We may process sensitive or special categories of personal information, such as that relating to health, disabilities, race, ethnicity, political opinions, biometrics, or religion, for the purpose(s) for which it was provided or for which you have provided express consent. For example, we may collect and receive sensitive personal information from you when you:

* provide such information to us, a travel agent, or another third party involved in your travel arrangements at the time of or following your booking;

* consent to the collection of your digital image to enable our supplier's facial recognition system for lounge access purposes; or

* provide information required by public health authorities or other government agencies as contemplated by 4.1.j.

We occasionally receive personal information from law enforcement agencies and other sources relating to criminal activity (or alleged criminal activity) and may use that information where necessary, and where permitted by applicable law, to detect or prevent unlawful activity occurring during air travel. We consider this to be in the substantial public interest.

[6\. How Delta Uses Cookies, Tags, and Similar Technologies](#expander-image-panel-tent_parsys_expander_4)

#### 6.1. **Cookies**

Delta uses cookies, tags, and other similar technologies. For simplicity, we refer to all these technologies as "cookies". These technologies allow us to recognize your preference information, keep track of your purchases, remember your SkyMiles number, and facilitate effective Website administration. We use the information we collect to enhance your visit to the Website and to provide you with information tailored to your needs.  
  
Your Internet browser(s) will offer you the option to refuse cookies, but doing so may affect your use of some portions of Delta’s and our [SkyMiles Partners'](https://www.delta.com/us/en/skymiles/how-to-earn-miles/airline-partners) and [Promotional Partners](https://www.delta.com/us/en/skymiles/how-to-earn-miles/overview)’ web services. Please refer to your browser options to learn more about cookie management.  
  
Delta has engaged third party tracking and advertising providers to act on Delta's behalf to track and analyze your usage of our Website through the use of cookies, pixel tags / web beacons, and similar technologies. At our request, these third parties collect, and share with us, usage information about visits to our Website, measure and research the effectiveness of our advertisements, track page usage and paths followed during visits through our Website, help us target our Internet banner advertisements on our Website and on other sites, and track use of our Internet banner advertisements and other links from our marketing partners' sites to our Website. To learn about the available mechanisms for opting out of cookies and technologies related to interest-based advertising, see the descriptions and links in the table below.  
  
Our Website and App are not configured to read or respond to “do not track” settings or signals in your browser headings or mobile device settings, which vary by provider. In lieu of a browser- or device-based opt-out solution, we have identified in the table below certain Digital Advertising Alliance and other approved methods for placement of “opt-out” cookies. Our Website and those of our third party advertisers or other vendors are configured to read and honor these opt-out cookies, so long as they are present on your computer or device. If you delete all cookies, you will need to reset your opt-out cookies. Please be aware that Delta does not control these opt-out processes.

#### 6.2. **Types of cookies and tags on our Website**

We use these kinds of cookies and tags on our Website and App:

**Cookie name / type**

**What these cookies do**

Required Cookies are essential for basic and enhanced website functionality and performance.  Without these cookies, services you have asked for and choices you have made for better functionality and features cannot be provided.

These cookies, such as those used for Google Analytics, collect information on how users use our Website, in order to help us fix technical issues or errors, and highlight areas such as navigation where we can improve our Website. For example, Google Analytics uses cookie identifiers to track the number of visitors to the Website, providing us with the volumes and sources of web page traffic.  This allows us to analyse web traffic patterns and run tests to optimize web pages and visits against key metrics.  

These cookies, such as language preference, help us customize our Website content based on a user's preferences. They remember the user's choices, their language, the country pages visited, and any changes the user makes to text size or other parts of our Website pages. The information these cookies collect may be anonymized and they cannot track browsing activity on other websites.  

These cookies, such as jsessionid, xssid, xssidsec, and dlsite, are essential for parts of our Website or App to operate. They enable users to move around our Website and allow us to recognize a user within our Website or using our App, so that we can provide users with service they asked for, such as remembering the user's sign-in details.  They are required to maintain a record of your Do Not Track preferences, so that we may respect them for future visits.  

Advertising Cookies:

Targeting

Advertising cookies enable us to understand your interests so that we can show you relevant offers and direct personalized advertising to you  

We may use other cookies, such as those used by advertising platforms we may use, such as Facebook or Twitter, to target and re-target visitors to our Website and App with digital advertising that is most relevant to the user.  These cookies are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement or particular content, as well as help measure the effectiveness of an advertising or marketing campaign. Using existing cookies from many sites already on your computer, we partner with third party companies to deliver advertising to specific computers.

The information collected by Google Analytics itself is anonymous, but if you respond to a marketing email, then a random ID is generated for Google Analytics which we can use along with your email address to manually identify you from other information we already hold in your customer profile. We may then use this information to generate potential sales leads or advertising.

You can find more information about how Google Analytics safeguards your data at:

* To persons with whom we are discussing selling any part of our business or to whom we sell any part of our business.

We may share with third parties anonymous, aggregated information about all our users.  
  
If your ticket is purchased pursuant to a corporate incentive agreement, we may disclose information concerning your travel to your employer or corporate travel manager.

When you use the App, a unique ID (which varies by device manufacturer and operating system) is read from or associated with your device to be used as an anonymous identifier for analytics and performance purposes. This ID might be generated by or shared with third parties providing us with analytics services, such as Adobe.

If you have questions about third parties with whom Delta may disclose information, please email Privacy@delta.com

#### 7.2. **Social Media and Messaging Platforms**

You may wish to share information regarding your travel or other activities with Delta on social media and messaging platforms provided by third parties. To utilize social media and message sharing features, you will be prompted to grant permissions within those third-party platforms, as you choose. For example, you will need to allow account login and publishing permissions. If you choose to contact or interact with us on a third-party social media or messaging platform, you understand that you are responsible for reviewing and understanding the terms and conditions, information security practices, and privacy policy applicable to the third-party platform, and that Delta is not responsible for how third-party social media and messaging platforms use, share, or protect your information. The activity on third-party social media and messaging platforms, and the data processed, stored, and provided on them, including data regarding interactions with Delta, is governed by the terms and conditions, information security practices, and privacy policy of those third-party platforms.  
  
7.3. **Disclosure of personal information to customers traveling under the same booking**  

When you make a booking, you will be provided with a booking reference such as a confirmation number or record locator number. Your booking reference should be kept confidential at all times. Disclosing your booking reference to other customers may allow them to access your booking details through our systems. If you are traveling with others under the same booking and would not like your individual booking details to be disclosed to them, you may prefer to have each person make and pay for separate bookings.

#### 7.4. **Optional biometrics services** 

Delta offers eligible customers, including eligible customers flying on Aeromexico, Air France-KLM, or Virgin Atlantic, the ability to improve their airport experience using optional biometrics services, including facial comparison technology, at participating airports.

You may choose to use facial comparison technology for identity verification, including at flight check-in, bag drop, and boarding gates. If you choose to use facial comparison technology, your image is taken when you would otherwise present another form of identification. The image is encrypted and sent to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for the purpose of verifying your identity. If CBP determines that the image matches images associated with your passport or images in CBP's database, CBP transmits a unique identifier back to Delta through an encrypted channel. Delta may associate the unique identifier with other information about you, such as your name and flight number, for the purpose of providing the relevant service. Delta does not receive any biometric information.    

For more information about CBP’s facial comparison technology, see the [CBP Traveler Verification Service Privacy Impact Assessment](https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhscbppia-056-traveler-verification-service). Please note that if you choose to use facial comparison technology at TSA check points or during CBP processing, TSA and CBP control the processing of your personal information, and this Privacy Policy does not apply.  

7.5. **Contact Tracing**

To promote healthy travel and prevent the spread of COVID-19, all Delta customers entering the United States, including U.S. passport holders, are encouraged to provide contact tracing information. Participation in contact tracing is voluntary unless specified by a specific flight, country, city or region.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in collaboration with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) supports domestic COVID-19 control efforts by making contact information for customers traveling internationally available to state and local health departments to contact you and provide follow-up instructions for testing and/or potential quarantine.  Delta shares this information with the CDC via CBP utilizing established channels for the Advance Passenger Information System (APIS).   For more information, go to [www.CDC.gov](https://www.cdc.gov/) or [www.CBP.gov](https://www.cbp.gov/), or see [CBP’s Privacy Impact Assessment for the Advance Passenger Information System](https://www.dhs.gov/publication/advanced-passenger-information-system-apis-update-national-counterterrorism-center-nctc) for details about how CBP uses APIS information.

7.6.   **Unaccompanied Minors**

When children travel alone on our flights, we take every step to make sure the child is safe.  Delta may disclose information pertaining to an unaccompanied minor’s itinerary, for example, in ensuring the safety and security of the child traveling on Delta flights, complying with applicable law and regulations, and coordinating transportation and other services with the child’s parents or guardian.

[9\. Your Rights](#expander-image-panel-tent_parsys_expander_7)

This section 9 applies only to individuals in the European Union, UK and other countries which grant the rights described here. These rights will apply only in certain circumstances.

#### 9.1. **Requesting a copy of your information**

To the extent you are legally entitled, you can request confirmation of whether or not we process your personal information, and details of the information that we hold about you and how we use it.

You also have a right to access your personal information and to be provided with a copy.

#### 9.2. **Right to rectification of personal data**

If you believe that the personal data we hold about you is inaccurate, you may request that we correct it. You may also request us to complete personal data about you which is incomplete.

#### 9.3. **Right to restrict processing of personal data**

You have the right to request that we restrict processing of your personal information where one of the following applies:

* You claim that the personal data is not accurate. The restriction will apply until we have taken steps to ensure the accuracy of the personal data.

* The processing is unlawful, but you do not want us to erase the personal data.

* We no longer require the personal data for the purposes of processing, but you still need it in connection with a legal claim.

* You have exercised your right to object to the processing. The restriction will apply until we have taken steps to verify whether we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing

#### 9.4. **Right to request deletion of personal data ("right to be forgotten")**

You may request the erasure, suspension of processing or anonymization of your personal information in certain circumstances. For example, you may request erasure, suspension of processing or anonymization if:

* The personal information is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed.  
      
    
* You have withdrawn your consent and we have no other legal basis for processing the personal information.  
      
    
*  You have exercised your right to object to processing the personal information, and we have no overriding legitimate grounds to continue processing it.  
      
    
* The personal information is excessive for the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed. 

Under certain circumstances, we may refuse a request for erasure, suspension of processing or anonymization, for example, where we need to use the personal data to comply with a legal obligation or to establish, make or defend legal claims.  
  
If you exercise your right to erasure or anonymization, this will potentially remove records which we hold for your benefit, such as your SkyMiles account information (including miles that may be in your SkyMiles account) and your presence on a marketing suppression list.

#### 9.5. **Right to object to processing of personal data**

You have a right, at any stage, to object to our using your personal information to send you marketing information.  
  
You also have the right to object to our using your personal information where our reason is based on our legitimate interests. We will have to stop processing until we can establish that we have compelling legitimate grounds which override your interests, rights, and freedoms, or that we need to continue using it for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.

#### 9.6. **Right to data portability**

This right applies where:

* Our reason for using your personal information is either that you have given consent or that the processing is necessary for us to perform a contract with you; and

* We process the personal information by automated means.

This is a right to receive all the personal information which you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and to transmit this to another controller directly, where this is technically feasible.

#### 9.7. **Complaints to regulator**

You have a right to complain to a supervisory authority (i.e., a regulator which oversees data protection law compliance), for example, in the UK or the European Union country where you live or work or where you believe we have infringed your privacy rights.

**9.8. Rights Applicable Only in Brazil**

You have the right to request information identifying the public and private entities with which your personal information has been shared.

**9.9. Exercising these rights**

We may charge you a small administration fee to respond to your request as allowed by applicable law. In general, we do not charge any fee where the right is based on European Union law, UK law, the Brazilian General Data Protection law, and other applicable laws. (We can charge an administrative fee for extra copies of your information and in certain exceptional circumstances.) 

Where we receive a request to exercise one of these rights, we will provide information on the action we take on the request without undue delay and in any event within one month of receipt of the request. This time may be extended by a further two months in certain circumstances, for example, where requests are complex or numerous.  

Where we do not carry out your request, we will tell you without delay and in any event within one month of receipt of the request, and we will explain our reasons for not taking the action requested.  

Any request you make must be in writing and include your name and address and any other information that may identify you, such as where your request relates to a travel booking, please provide your booking reference (e.g., confirmation number or record locator number), SkyMiles Account number if you have one, the dates on which the travel took place, and any other relevant information that will assist us to identify your booking. You must also provide a photocopy of your passport or driver’s license so we can verify your identity. Please send your written requests to:

[12\. Information Security](#expander-image-panel-tent_parsys_expander_10)

Information Security is important to Delta.

These safeguards are regularly reviewed to protect against unauthorized access, disclosure, and improper use of your information, and to maintain the accuracy and integrity of that data.  In the event of a data breach, we adhere to data breach notification requirements and incident reporting obligations to supervising authorities and/or data subjects, as required by applicable laws. The substance and time frames applicable to these remedies are set forth in applicable laws.  Please note that your information may be processed on third-party infrastructure that is not owned by Delta or its affiliates.

[13\. Data Transfers](#expander-image-panel-tent_parsys_expander_11)

Delta is based in Atlanta, Georgia, USA and we may transfer personal information in compliance with applicable law to the US and other jurisdictions where Delta provides services.

Some of the countries where Delta operates or where third parties operate on behalf of Delta may not have the equivalent level of data protection laws as those in your location. If we need to transfer personal data from your location to such countries, we will take steps to make sure your personal data continues to be protected and safeguarded. In particular, we may require parties to whom we transfer your data to agree to abide by suitable contractual obligations, such as, in the case of transfers from the EU or UK,  the Model Clauses approved by the European Commission and permitted under Article 46 of the European Union General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") or the UK secretary of state or under other relevant body. If you would like to obtain the details of such safeguards, you can request them from the Data Protection Officer at [Privacy@delta.com](mailto:Privacy@delta.com). In some limited circumstances, we may also transfer your information from your location to other countries where permitted by applicable law (for example under Article 49, GDPR in the case of transfers from the European Economic Area). This includes where it is necessary for the performance of a contract between us and you and where the transfer is necessary in connection with legal proceedings. To exercise your rights with respect to personal data transferred to third parties, you may submit your request directly to Delta in accordance with Section 9.

[14\. Promotional Partners](#expander-image-panel-tent_parsys_expander_12)

* **Right to access your personal information**

To the extent you are legally entitled, you can request confirmation of whether or not we process your personal information, and details of the information that we hold about you and how we use it.

You also have a right to access your personal information and to be provided with a copy. 

* **Right to rectification of personal data**

If you believe that the personal data we hold about you is inaccurate, you may request that we correct it. You may also request us to complete personal data about you which is incomplete. We will make reasonable efforts to revise any information that is incorrect, or update or change your information as we are required to do by applicable law.

* **Right to restrict the processing of personal data**

You have the right to request that we restrict processing of your personal information where one of the following applies:

o You claim that the personal data is not accurate. The restriction will apply until we have taken steps to ensure the accuracy of the personal data.  
  
o The processing is unlawful, but you do not want us to erase the personal data.

o We no longer require the personal data for the purposes of processing, but you still need it in connection with a legal claim.

Under certain circumstances, we may refuse a request for erasure, for example, where we need to use the personal data to comply with a legal obligation or to establish, make or defend legal claims.

* **Right to withdraw your consent**

Where you have provided your consent to us for processing your information, you can withdraw this at any time by opting out in your SkyMiles Profile, or by contacting us at https://www.delta.com/contactus/commentComplaint.
