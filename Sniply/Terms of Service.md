**PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS CAREFULLY**

BY CLICKING “I ACCEPT,” OR BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, OR OTHERWISE ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTOOD, AND, AS A CONDITION TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY, THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS, INCLUDING SNIPLY’S PRIVACY POLICY AND ANY ADDITIONAL TERMS AND POLICIES SNIPLY MAY PROVIDE FROM TIME TO TIME (TOGETHER, THESE “TERMS”).

If you are not eligible, or do not agree to the Terms, then you do not have our permission to use the Service.

YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, AND SNIPLY’S PROVISION OF THE SERVICE TO YOU, CONSTITUTES AN AGREEMENT BY SNIPLY AND BY YOU TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS.

Please read the Sniply Privacy Policy ([https://sniply.io/privacy-policy/](https://sniply.io/privacy-policy/)) carefully for information relating to our collection, use, storage, disclosure of your personal information. The Sniply Privacy Policy is incorporated by this reference into, and made a part of, these Terms.

1\. Sniply Service Overview
---------------------------

The Service provides a link creation tool that enables users to produce customized links, allowing for enhanced analytics, customization, call-to-actions, and more.

2. Eligibility
--------------

You must be at least 16 years old to use the Service. By agreeing to these Terms, you represent and warrant to us that: (a) you are at least 16 years old; (b) you have not previously been suspended or removed from the Service; and (c) your registration and your use of the Service is in compliance with any and all applicable laws and regulations. If you are an entity, organization, or company, the individual accepting these Terms on your behalf represents and warrants that they have authority to bind you to these Terms and references to you herein (and all of your obligations hereunder) will refer to such entity and any individual using the Service on such entity’s behalf.

3\. Accounts and Registration
-----------------------------

To access most features of the Service, you must register for an account. When you register for an account, you may be required to provide us with some information about yourself, such as your name, email address, or other contact information. You agree that the information you provide to us is accurate and that you will keep it accurate and up-to-date at all times. When you register, you will be asked to provide a password. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password, and you accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account. If you believe that your account is no longer secure, then you must immediately notify us at [\[email protected\]](https://sniply.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

4\. General Payment Terms
-------------------------

Premium features of the Service will require you to pay fees upon registering for the applicable premium service. Before you pay any fees, you will have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged. All fees are in U.S. Dollars and are non-refundable. Fees vary based on the plan, with different pricing schemes for individual users and organizations.

### 4.1 Price

Sniply reserves the right to determine pricing for the Service. Sniply will make reasonable efforts to keep pricing information published on the website up to date. We encourage you to check our website periodically for current pricing information, located here: [https://sniply.io/pricing/](https://sniply.io/pricing/). Sniply may change the fees for any feature of the Service, including additional fees or charges, if Sniply gives you advance notice of changes before they apply. Sniply, at its sole discretion, may make promotional offers with different features and different pricing to any of Sniply’s customers. These promotional offers, unless made to you, will not apply to your offer or these Terms.

### 4.2 Authorization

You authorize Sniply to charge all sums for the orders that you make and any level of Service you select as described in these Terms or published by Sniply, to the payment method specified in your account. If you pay any fees with a credit card, Sniply may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account prior to your purchase to verify that the credit card is valid and has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your purchase.

### 4.3 Subscription Service and Cancellation Policy

The Service may include automatically recurring payments for periodic charges (“**Subscription Service**”). If you activate a Subscription Service, you authorize Sniply to periodically charge, on a going-forward basis and until cancellation of either the recurring payments or your account, all accrued sums on or before the payment due date for the accrued sums. The “**Subscription Billing Date**” is the date when you purchase your first subscription to the Service. For information on the “Subscription Fee”, please see our Pricing page. Your account will be charged automatically on the Subscription Billing Date all applicable fees for the next subscription period. The subscription will continue unless and until you cancel your subscription or we terminate it. You must cancel your subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next periodic Subscription Fee to your account. We will bill the periodic Subscription Fee to the payment method you provide to us during registration (or to a different payment method if you change your payment information). You may cancel the Subscription Service by accessing your account settings at: [https://snip.ly/dashboard/settings/](https://snip.ly/dashboard/settings) or by contacting us at: [\[email protected\]](https://sniply.io/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

Sniply may suspend or terminate access to the Service for any account for which any amount is due but unpaid. In addition to the amount due for the Service, a delinquent account will be charged with fees or charges that are incidental to any chargeback or collection of any the unpaid amount, including collection fees.

Certain features of the Service may permit users to upload content to the Service, including photographs, text, graphics, links, and other types of works (“**User Content**”) and to publish User Content on the Service. **You retain any copyright and other proprietary rights that you may hold in the User Content that you post to the Service.** _Nevertheless, we need certain permission from you in order to provide the Service._

2. your User Content, and the use of your User Content as contemplated by these Terms, does not and will not: (i) infringe, violate, or misappropriate any third party right, including any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, moral right, privacy right, right of publicity, or any other intellectual property or proprietary right; (ii) slander, defame, libel, or invade the right of privacy, publicity or other property rights of any other person; or (iii) cause Sniply to violate any law or regulation; and
3. your User Content could not be deemed by a reasonable person to be objectionable, profane, indecent, pornographic, harassing, threatening, embarrassing, hateful, or otherwise inappropriate.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, we reserve the right to screen, remove, edit, or block any User Content we find in violation of the Terms or that we find, in our sole discretion to be otherwise objectionable, at our sole discretion.

### 8.5 User Content Disclaimer

We are under no obligation to edit or control User Content that you or other users upload or publish, and will not be in any way responsible or liable for User Content. Sniply may, however, at any time and without prior notice, screen, remove, edit, or block any User Content that in our sole judgment violates these Terms or is otherwise objectionable. You understand that when using the Service you may be exposed to User Content from a variety of sources and acknowledge that User Content may be inaccurate, offensive, indecent, or objectionable.

14\. Disclaimers; No Warranties
-------------------------------

THE SERVICE AND ALL MATERIALS AND CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND ON AN “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS.

SNIPLY DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE OR ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE, OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT OFFERED THROUGH THE SERVICE, WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR FREE OF ERRORS, VIRUSES, OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, AND SNIPLY DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THOSE ISSUES WILL BE CORRECTED.

NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM THE SERVICE OR SNIPLY ENTITIES OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY REGARDING ANY OF THE SNIPLY ENTITIES OR THE SERVICE THAT IS NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TERMS. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE THAT MAY RESULT FROM THE SERVICE AND YOUR DEALING WITH ANY OTHER SERVICE USER. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU USE ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND THAT WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR PROPERTY (INCLUDING YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR MOBILE DEVICE USED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICE) OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, INCLUDING USER CONTENT.

HOWEVER, SNIPLY DOES NOT DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTY OR OTHER RIGHT THAT SNIPLY IS PROHIBITED FROM DISCLAIMING UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.

15\. Limitation of Liability
----------------------------

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE SNIPLY ENTITIES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, OR ANY OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSS) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF, OR YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, THE SERVICE OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT ON THE SERVICE, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT ANY SNIPLY ENTITY HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGE.

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE SNIPLY ENTITIES TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE USE OF OR ANY INABILITY TO USE ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICE OR OTHERWISE UNDER THESE TERMS, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF: (A) THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO SNIPLY FOR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICE IN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EVENT OR CIRCUMSTANCE GIVING RISE TO CLAIM; OR (B) $100.

EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS INTENDED TO AND DOES ALLOCATE THE RISKS BETWEEN THE PARTIES UNDER THESE TERMS. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 15 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

16. Arbitration

You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights under these Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms at any time without notice or consent. The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of any provision. Throughout these Terms the use of the word “including” means “including but not limited to”. If any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.

### 17.1 Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania without regard to conflict of law principles.
