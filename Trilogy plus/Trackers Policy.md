VIMEO OTT COOKIE POLICY
=======================

Last updated: May 24th, 2021

Vimeo.com, Inc. (“**Vimeo OTT**,” “**we**,” or “**us**”), uses cookies and similar tracking technologies on Vimeo OTT embeddable video players and the websites and applications (“**apps**”) it hosts on behalf of its content sellers (“**Producers**”). By using any of these services, you agree to the placement and use of cookies and similar technologies on your device. This Cookie Policy forms part of the [Vimeo OTT Privacy Policy](https://www.trilogyplus.com/privacy)

COOKIE BASICS
-------------

A cookie is a small text file that is stored in your web browser that allows Vimeo or a third party to recognize you using a unique identifier.

**Who sets them:** First-party cookies are set by Vimeo OTT. Third-party cookies are set by companies other than Vimeo OTT, such as analytics providers and advertisers.

**What they do:** “Essential” cookies enable services we offer. “Non-essential” cookies help us understand how our services are being used (i.e., analytics) and deliver advertisements. Some cookies may track you across multiple websites you visit (including ones not operated by us) to help deliver advertisements that may be relevant to you.

**How long they last:** Cookies may be either “session” or “persistent.” A session cookie expires (i.e., is deleted) when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains until it expires or you delete the cookies via your browser settings. Expiration dates are set in the cookies themselves and may vary in length, depending on the purpose of the cookie.

COOKIES FOUND ON VIMEO OTT SERVICES
-----------------------------------

We use all types of cookies in our web-based services. Our websites include [https://vimeo.com/ott/](https://vimeo.com/ott/) and the sites that we host on behalf of Producers (“**Producer Sites**”).

**Producer Sites:** When you visit a Producer Site, Vimeo OTT and third parties authorized by Vimeo OTT, the Producer, or both, will set cookies in your browser. Vimeo OTT sets first-party, essential cookies to enable certain features and remember your preferences. For example, cookies keep you logged in, allow you to purchase items, and maintain your language and volume settings. Third parties set cookies for both essential and non-essential purposes including analytics (e.g., Google Analytics) and advertising (e.g., Google DoubleClick for Publishers). Third-party cookies may differ among Producer Sites depending on a number of factors, including whether the Producer has enabled advertising, and which analytics providers are being utilized.

**Producer Apps:** Producer apps do not use cookies, but may use tracking technologies to, for example, authenticate you as a registered user, allow you to use the app’s features, and help the Producer understand how the app is being used. You cannot opt out of these mobile tracking technologies, but you may delete the app and use the web version instead.

**Vimeo OTT video player:** Vimeo OTT’s embeddable video player uses first-party cookies that we consider essential to the video player experience. Please note that a third-party website may place cookies of its own. We have no control over third-party websites or the cookies they set.
