Disclosing your personal information

We do not sell your personal information to third parties for their marketing or any other purposes.

We may provide or make your personal information available to:

* Other companies in the Naspers group of companies, details of which are available [here](https://www.naspers.com/companies), to learn more about our customers and create a more relevant, engaging customer experience.
* Companies that provide services to us or on our behalf, or enable us to provide services to you or operate the Platforms, including contractors, debt collectors, lawyers and auditors.
* Other parties where we are required to provide your personal information to comply with the law or protect our Platforms.
* Prospective and actual buyers, in the event that we sell, transfer or merge any part of our businesses or assets, or prospective or actual sellers, in the event that we choose to buy or merge with any other business.
* Third parties if you have agreed to us sharing your personal information with them, such as where you enter into a competition sponsored by a third party and where the provision of your information is a condition for entry to the competition, or where you express your interest in a product or service about which you would like more information.
* Other parties that provide content, advertising services or functionality on our Platforms. These third parties include i) advertising service providers which help us and our advertising customers provide advertisements that are tailored to users’ interests, ii) audience-measurement companies which help us measure the overall usage of our Platforms and compare that usage with other online services, and iii) social networking services such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Instagram that you may select to use to register for and log into some of our services and share things you find on our Platforms with your social network. We do not control the privacy practices of these or any other third party services and recommend you read the privacy policies of these services before connecting to them. These third parties may collect or receive information about your use of our Platforms, including through the use of cookies, web beacons and other technologies, and this information may be collected over time and combined with information collected on various websites and online services.

We may also share your personal information with third parties, including our third-party service providers who may use artificial intelligence tools, to process your personal information, provided that the third party has agreed to be bound by this privacy notice or similar terms which offer the same level of protection as this privacy notice.

We also share our research and statistical information with various third parties. However, this information does not include your personal information, cannot be linked to you and you cannot be identified from these statistics.

Please note, some of the people or companies who have access to your personal information are located outside South Africa. We will not share your personal information with these parties unless they are bound by privacy laws and corporate rules or agreements with us that protect the privacy of your personal information and limit their ability to share your personal information with other parties. We will get your permission before we share your information with any third party.

Your rights

You have the right to ask us not to contact you for marketing purposes, and you can do this at any time by using any of the various “opt out” options that we always provide you with when we send you marketing communications.

We manage several separate marketing distribution lists across the various Media24 business units, and opting out of one distribution list does not automatically remove you from all the other lists.

You also have the right to request access to the information we have collected about you, request that we correct or update any incorrect or incomplete information, or request a deletion of your personal information. Such request can be submitted by using the data subject access request form found [here](https://privacyportal-de.onetrust.com/webform/37b4518e-0f3e-4cc8-995a-22b30e93ed4f/5db1f52c-58f7-4de1-8c63-5032f28f9406).

Unless a lawful exception under privacy law exists, you have the right not to be subject to a decision that results in legal consequences for you or significantly affects you, if the decision is based **solely** on the automated processing of personal information intended to profile you, including aspects such as your performance at work, creditworthiness, reliability, location, health, personal preferences, or conduct. If this right applies to any automated decision-making we undertake, we will provide you with the opportunity to make representations about our decision. You may at any time lodge an objection with us regarding our collection and use of your personal information by clicking [here](https://privacyportal-de.onetrust.com/webform/37b4518e-0f3e-4cc8-995a-22b30e93ed4f/5db1f52c-58f7-4de1-8c63-5032f28f9406).

Our commitment to security

We have put in place administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect your personal information and prevent loss, damage or unauthorised access to or disclosure of your information. These security safeguards are based on generally accepted information security practices and procedures which apply to the Platforms, products and services we provide. We regularly check that these safeguards are correctly implemented and continually updated in response to new risks or any identified deficiencies.

Any information you submit to us through the internet is at your own risk. Once we receive your personal information, our security safeguards apply.

If we outsource any services to a third party that require the collection or use of your personal information, we put in place contracts that require these companies or people to respect the security of your personal information, treat it in accordance with the law, and collect and use it only for the purposes authorised by us.

Links to other sites

Our Platforms contain links to and from websites, mobile applications and/or services of third parties, advertisers and/or affiliates. Clicking on these links or enabling these connections may allow third parties to collect or share information about you. Please note, we have not evaluated nor control these third parties and are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other parties when you leave our Platforms. We recommend you read the privacy statements of every website you visit which collects personal information.

International Users

Media24 is based in South Africa and, regardless of where you use or access our Platforms, products or services, your information may be transferred to and maintained on servers located in South Africa or elsewhere in the world.

Any of the information that we collect about you or receive from you is stored in line with South African privacy laws, regulations and standards, which may not be equivalent to the laws in your country of residence.

We may occasionally update this privacy policy. Any changes we make will be posted on this page and we will notify you of the update in the appropriate manner.
