ARE THERE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS AND DISCLOSURES REQUIRED FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS?

_In Short: Yes, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) provides California residents with specific rights regarding their personal information that is collected._ **Collection and Disclosure of Personal Information** In the past 12 months, we have collected those categories of information set forth above in Section 1 of this Privacy Policy. We collect personal information for the purposes set forth in Section 2 of this Privacy Policy and we may provide your personal information to those third parties set forth in Section 3 of this Privacy Policy. **Access to Information and Privacy Rights** As a California resident, you have the right to (i) request additional information pertaining to your personal information that we have collected (including the sources from which such information has been collected), used, disclosed, and sold in the preceding 12 months, and our business purpose for collecting that personal information, (ii) request that we delete some or all of your personal data (subject to certain exceptions), and (iii) opt-out of any disclosure of storage, use, or sale of your personal data. If you have any questions, or if would like to exercise your individual data rights under the CCPA, please contact us . Note that we may ask that you provide certain information relating to your request in order to verify your identity.You may designate an agent to submit such requests on your behalf. The agent will need to provide us with your signed permission to act on your behalf. We may require you to verify your identity directly and confirm that the agent has your permission to submit the request on your behalf.**Financial Incentive**We may offer financial incentives such as discounts and promotional offers when you provide us with contact information. When you sign-up for our email list or other discounts and promotional offers, you opt-in to a financial incentive. You may withdraw from a financial incentive by opting out from our emails or closing your account at any time. While we do not generally assign monetary or other value to personal information, California law requires that we assign value in the context of financial incentives. For such purposes, the value of the personal information provided is connected to the estimated cost of providing the relevant financial incentive(s) for which the information was collected. **Sales of Personal Information**We do not sell your personal information for monetary consideration. Applicable law, including the CCPA, may however deem our sharing of your personal information with third party service providers (including marketing services), as “sales” for purposes of the CCPA. We therefore may “sell” your personal information by means of disclosure in exchange for valuable consideration.[Click hereto learn more about maesa-request.my.onetrust](https://maesa-request.my.onetrust.com/webform/59315583-acc9-40d8-94dc-93863a6bc154/8980fc62-0843-4dc9-b9af-caa71a25f9f5) if you do not want us to sell your personal information to any third parties.
