**_In Short:_** _If you choose to register or log in to our websites using a social media account, we may have access to certain information about you._

Our Sites offers you the ability to register an account and login using either the username and password you provide, or your third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile Information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, e-mail address, friends list, profile picture as well as other information you choose to make public. If you login using Facebook, we may also request access to other permissions related to your account, such as friends, check-ins, and likes, and you may choose to grant or deny us access to each individual permission.

We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy policy or that are otherwise made clear to you on the Sites. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third party social media provider.

HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?
=====================================

**_In Short:_** _We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy unless otherwise required by law._

We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements).

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?
=====================================

**_In Short:_** _We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures._

We have implemented reasonable and appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process.

Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Sites is at your own risk. You should only access the services within a secure environment.

DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?
======================================

**_In Short:_** _We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age._

We do not knowingly solicit or collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.  **BY USING THE SITES, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE AT LEAST 18 OR THAT YOU ARE THE PARENT OR GUARDIAN OF SUCH A MINOR AND CONSENT TO SUCH MINOR DEPENDENT’S USE OF THE SITE**.  If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records.  If you become aware of any data we have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at privacy@kristinesshair.com

WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?
=============================

We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.  We may take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections. You may request to access, change or delete your personal information by contacting privacy@kristinesshair.com.

If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note however that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal.

**ARE THERE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS AND DISCLOSURES REQUIRED FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS?**

**_In Short:_** _Yes, the_ _California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) provides California residents with specific rights regarding their personal information that is collected._

**Collection and Disclosure of Personal Information**

In the past 12 months, we have collected those categories of information set forth above in Section 1 of this Privacy Policy. We collect personal information for the purposes set forth in Section 2 of this Privacy Policy and we may provide your personal information to those third parties set forth in Section 3 of this Privacy Policy.

**Access to Information and Privacy Rights**

As a California resident, you have the right to (i) request additional information pertaining to your personal information that we have collected (including the sources from which such information has been collected), used, disclosed, and sold in the preceding 12 months, and our business purpose for collecting that personal information, (ii) request that we delete some or all of your personal data (subject to certain exceptions), and (iii) opt-out of any disclosure of storage, use, or sale of your personal data.  If you have any questions, or if would like to exercise your individual data rights under the CCPA, please contact us  **[](mailto:privacy@kristinesshair.com)**.  Note that we may ask that you provide certain information relating to your request in order to verify your identity.

You may designate an agent to submit such requests on your behalf.  The agent will need to provide us with your signed permission to act on your behalf.   We may require you to verify your identity directly and confirm that the agent has your permission to submit the request on your behalf.

### Financial Incentive

We may offer financial incentives such as discounts and promotional offers when you provide us with contact information. When you sign-up for our email list or other discounts and promotional offers, you opt-in to a financial incentive. You may withdraw from a financial incentive by opting out from our emails or closing your account at any time. While we do not generally assign monetary or other value to personal information, California law requires that we assign value in the context of financial incentives. For such purposes, the value of the personal information provided is connected to the estimated cost of providing the relevant financial incentive(s) for which the information was collected.

**Sales of Personal Information**

We do not sell your personal information for monetary consideration.  Applicable law, including the CCPA, may however deem our sharing of your personal information with third party service providers (including marketing services), as “sales” for purposes of the CCPA.  We therefore may “sell” your personal information by means of disclosure in exchange for valuable consideration.

**[](mailto:privacy@kristinesshair.com)**if you do not want us to sell your personal information to any third parties.

Your exercise of any of your rights under the CCPA will not be used against you, or to discriminate against you in any way.

DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS POLICY?
==================================

**_In Short:_** _Yes, we may update this policy to stay compliant with relevant laws._

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated “Last updated” date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes to this privacy policy, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this privacy policy frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.
