**International transfers**

Honeywell is a global organization and your personal information may be transferred to, held, stored or used across various locations worldwide such as the US, Mexico and India in accordance with applicable law. This means that when we collect your personal information it may be processed in countries that may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country.

Tento postup může sloužit vylepšení a přizpůsobení našich webů vašim předvolbám a dalším účelům stanoveným v tomto Prohlášení o ochraně soukromí.

Společnost Honeywell shromažďuje a používá obchodní kontaktní údaje ke komunikaci nebo transakcím, včetně provádění due diligence ohledně produktů či služeb, případně poskytování nebo přijímání produktů či služeb. Společnost Honeywell může například shromažďovat a používat obchodní kontaktní údaje za účelem usnadnění a správy objednávek, smluv, záruk, údržby a podobných obchodních funkcí, za účelem posouzení úvěryschopnosti a pro účely inkasování prostředků, za účelem pomoci při vyřizování našich vlastních interních požadavků a právních požadavků a (pokud by to bylo nutné) k obraně našich zájmů a nároků.
* **Služby a transakce**. Vaše osobní údaje používáme k poskytování služeb nebo provádění požadovaných transakcí. Může se jednat například (ale nikoli výlučně) o poskytnutí informací o zakoupených nebo jinak používaných produktech či službách naší společnosti, registraci zakoupených produktů, zpracování objednávek produktů, vyřizování reklamací, poskytování náhradních příruček k produktům, vyřizování vašich požadavků v rámci služeb zákazníkům nebo o používání našich webů.

Vaše osobní údaje můžeme používat k obchodním analýzám a jiným účelům, které nám pomáhají rozvíjet naši obchodní činnost a zvyšovat její kvalitu, jakož i kvalitu našich webů, produktů a služeb (včetně nových produktů a služeb), například tím, že naše weby přizpůsobíme určitým preferencím nebo zájmům.
* **Marketing**. Podle platné legislativy a předpisů smíme používat vaše osobní údaje, abychom vás informovali o produktech nebo službách, které vás mohou zajímat, nebo s vámi jiným způsobem komunikovali o našich nabídkách, událostech a novinkách, průzkumech, speciálních nabídkách a souvisejících tématech. Marketingovou komunikaci zasílanou e-mailem můžete kdykoli bezplatně zrušit, když použijete odkaz pro zrušení odběru v kterémkoli z e-mailových marketingových materiálů, které od nás dostáváte, nebo když se na nás obrátíte prostřednictvím kontaktních údajů uvedených v tomto prohlášení. S ohledem na zemi vašeho pobytu můžete mít možnost odhlásit se z jiných typů marketingové komunikace. Máte-li zájem o více informací, kontaktujte nás s využitím kontaktních údajů uvedených v tomto Prohlášení o ochraně soukromí. V některých jurisdikcích náleží fyzickým osobám (např. obyvatelům Kalifornie) právo požadovat určité informace týkající se toho, jak sdělujeme osobní údaje třetím stranám pro účely přímého marketingu třetích stran. Chcete-li získat další informace o našich praktikách při poskytování údajů pro marketingové účely, kontaktujte nás v souladu s níže uvedenými pokyny.
* **Zájmově orientovaná reklama**. Shromažďujeme údaje o vašich online aktivitách a identifikujeme vaše zájmy, abychom vám mohli poskytovat nejrelevantnější reklamu.

* **Finanční pobídkové a věrnostní programy**. Shromažďujeme a používáme osobní údaje k udržování a správě finančních pobídkových a věrnostních programů. Osobní údaje, které poskytujete v rámci těchto programů, využíváme k tomu, abychom vám nabízeli jedinečné odměny, sledovali váš stav v programu a umožnili výměnu programových bodů za produkty, propagační materiály, školicí semináře a další položky. V míře, do jaké to připouští zákon, můžeme také využít jakékoli osobní údaje, které nám poskytnete ve spojitosti s programem finančních pobídek, k jakémukoli jinému účelu uvedenému v tomto Prohlášení o ochraně soukromí. Prostudujte si podmínky každého finančního pobídkového programu, do něhož se chcete zaregistrovat nebo jehož se chcete účastnit, protože takové podmínky mohou být speciálně přizpůsobeny příslušnému programu. Pokud poskytnete souhlas s účastí v těchto programech, můžete jej kdykoli zrušit tak, že nás kontaktujete s využitím kontaktních údajů uvedených na konci tohoto Prohlášení o ochraně soukromí, případně v souladu s pokyny stanovenými v podmínkách příslušného programu.

V souvislosti s žádostí o zaměstnání nebo souvisejícími dotazy nám můžete poskytnout informace o sobě, například ve formě CV či životopisu, profesních referencí, informací o vzdělání a praxi, informací o odborných školeních a certifikacích. My a další členové naší skupiny můžeme tyto informace použít za účelem zvážení uzavření pracovního poměru, ověření vaší spolehlivosti či způsobilosti k výkonu práce, případně jak se uvádí jinak v jakémkoli samostatném prohlášení o ochraně soukromí nebo v jiném prohlášení, jež vám bude poskytnuto v souvislosti s vaší žádostí. K získávání, shromažďování a uchovávání žádostí o zaměstnání můžeme využívat třetí stranu (např. firmu zabývající se náborem pracovníků) nebo platformu sociálních médií. Další informace najdete v našem [Prohlášení o ochraně soukromí uchazečů o zaměstnání](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/applicant-privacy-notice#czech).

* **Vynucování práva**. Shromažďované osobní údaje můžeme používat k odhalování, prevenci a řešení podvodů, porušování duševního vlastnictví, našich podmínek a ujednání, porušování zákona nebo jiného zneužití našich webů.

Pokud to zákon dovoluje, můžeme údaje shromažďované prostřednictvím našich webů spojovat s ostatními údaji, které o vás evidujeme (například s údaji o používání našich produktů a služeb), abychom vám nabídli dokonalejší a jednotnější prostředí určené ke spolupráci se zákazníky nebo k jiným účelům uvedeným v tomto prohlášení.

**Právní základ zpracování vašich údajů**

Pokud to vyžaduje zákon, zajistíme, aby zpracování vašich osobních údajů mělo právní základ. Ve většině případů bude právní základ záviset na příslušných osobních údajích a konkrétním kontextu, v němž je shromažďujeme.

* **Smlouva**: zpracování je nezbytné pro provádění služeb, jež vám poskytujeme, nebo za účelem realizace kroků (na vaši žádost) před provedením těchto služeb nebo v jejich očekávání.
* **Zákonná povinnost**: zpracování musíme provádět, abychom dostáli svým právním povinnostem, včetně dodržování platné legislativy, předpisů, státních a jiných obdobných požadavků, soudních rozhodnutí nebo předvolání.
* **Souhlas**: zpracování vychází z vašeho souhlasu se zpracováním osobních údajů k jednomu nebo více konkrétním účelům (např. marketing).
* **Oprávněné zájmy**: zpracování je nutné, protože na něm máme oprávněný zájem, například kvůli vývoji a zdokonalování našich webů, produktů nebo služeb k prospěchu našich zákazníků.
* **Životně důležité zájmy**: zpracování je nezbytné kvůli ochraně vašich životně důležitých zájmů (například ze zdravotních a bezpečnostních důvodů, pokud se zúčastníte schůzky na pracovišti společnosti Honeywell).

**Anonymizace údajů**

V souladu s platnou legislativou můžeme vaše osobní údaje anonymizovat, aby nebylo možné vás podle nich identifikovat. Anonymizované údaje se nepovažují za osobní údaje, a proto se na ně toto prohlášení nevztahuje. Anonymizované údaje můžeme shromažďovat, používat, agregovat a sdílet k jakýmkoli účelům.

**Jak dlouho údaje uchováváme**

Doba uložení vašich osobních údajů se liší podle účelu jejich zpracování. Například uchováváme osobní údaje potřebné k tomu, abychom vám mohli poskytovat produkty a služby nebo abychom mohli realizovat vámi požadované transakce, jste-li zákazníkem společnosti Honeywell nebo žádáte-li o zaměstnání prostřednictvím našich webů. V takovém případě budeme údaje z vaší žádosti uchovávat po takovou dobu, jak se uvádí v prohlášení o ochraně soukromí, jež vám je poskytnuto ve spojení s žádostí, případně jak to vyžaduje zákon. V ostatních případech uchováváme vaše osobní údaje tak dlouho, dokud jsou potřeba ke splnění účelu uvedeného v tomto prohlášení. Po uplynutí takové doby budou údaje anonymizovány (pokud to vyžaduje platná legislativa), odstraněny nebo zničeny.

**Sdělování údajů**

Podle platné legislativy smíme vaše osobní údaje sdílet s vybranými třetími stranami. Týká se to těchto třetích stran:

Od poskytovatelů služeb vyžadujeme, aby vaše osobní údaje chránili jako důvěrné.
* **Distributoři a jiní důvěryhodní obchodní partneři**. Vaše osobní údaje můžeme sdílet s třetími stranami, které distribuují naše produkty, a s dalšími důvěryhodnými obchodními partnery, abychom jim umožnili například posílat vám marketingové materiály. Sdílení osobních údajů k marketingovým účelům probíhá podle platné legislativy a předpisů.
* **Sdělování údajů ve spojitosti s transakcemi**. V souvislosti s určitými transakcemi můžeme sdělit některé nebo všechny vaše osobní údaje finančním institucím, státním úřadům a přepravním nebo poštovním společnostem, které se podílejí na uskutečnění transakce.
* **Sdělení údajů ve spojitosti s akvizicemi nebo odprodejem**. Mohou nastat okolnosti, kdy se společnost Honeywell ze strategických nebo jiných obchodních důvodů rozhodne v některých zemích prodat, koupit, odprodat, sloučit nebo jinak reorganizovat své podniky. Informace, které si o vás udržujeme, můžeme zpřístupnit do míry přiměřeně nezbytné k vyjednávání nebo provedení fúze, akvizice, odprodeje či prodeje části nebo veškerého majetku společnosti Honeywell.
* **Sdělení údajů z jiných důvodů**. Osobní údaje můžeme sdělit jiné straně, pokud to vyžaduje zákon (nebo nás k tomu opravňuje) nebo tak učiníme v dobré víře, že je to nutné ke splnění zákonných požadavků nebo kvůli dodržení právního procesu uplatňovaného vůči nám, dále k ochraně a obraně našich práv nebo majetku, v naléhavých případech a kvůli ochraně bezpečí osob.

**Mezinárodní přenosy**

Společnost Honeywell je globální organizace a vaše osobní údaje mohou být v souladu s platnou legislativou přenášeny, drženy, uchovávány nebo používány na různých místech po celém světě, například v USA, Mexiku a Indii. To znamená, že když shromažďujeme vaše osobní údaje, mohou být zpracovány v zemích, kde platí zákony na ochranu údajů, které se liší od zákonů vaší země.

Odvolání souhlasu nebude mít vliv na zákonnost jakéhokoli zpracování, které jsme provedli před odvoláním, ani to nebude mít vliv na zpracování vašich osobních údajů prováděné na základě jiných zákonných důvodů zpracování, než je souhlas.
* Můžete mít právo **odhlásit se z prodeje osobních údajů**. Společnost Honeywell neprodává vaše osobní údaje třetím stranám za účelem zisku. Vaše osobní údaje však sdílíme nebo jinak poskytujeme třetím stranám v souladu s tímto Prohlášením o ochraně soukromí a s naším [Prohlášením o používání souborů cookie](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/cookie-notice#czech). Spolupracujeme například s třetími stranami při distribuci našich produktů, poskytování technické pomoci, používání analytických nástrojů a funkcí webů a při marketingových aktivitách a prodeji našich produktů a služeb. Takové aktivity mohou zahrnovat poskytnutí osobních údajů třetím stranám a podle některých (nikoli však všech) zákonů na ochranu osobních údajů mohou být považovány za „prodej“ údajů.

Nebudeme žádné fyzické osoby diskriminovat za to, že uplatňují svá práva na ochranu osobních údajů.

Uplatňování vašich práv zajistíme podle platné legislativy.

I det omfang loven tillader det, kan vi også bruge personlige oplysninger, som du giver i forbindelse med et økonomisk incitamentsprogram, til andre formål, der er angivet i denne databeskyttelseserklæring. Gennemgå vilkårene og betingelserne for hvert økonomisk incitamentsprogram, som du ønsker at tilmelde dig eller deltage i, da sådanne vilkår og betingelser kan være svært skræddersyede til det relevante program. Hvis du accepterer at deltage i disse programmer, kan du til enhver tid trække samtykket tilbage ved at kontakte os ved hjælp af kontaktoplysningerne i bunden af denne databeskyttelseserklæring eller i overensstemmelse med instruktionerne i de gældende vilkår og betingelser for programmet.

* **Forskning og analyse**. Vi kan bruge dine personlige oplysninger til at udføre forskning og analyse for at hjælpe os med at analysere dine købspræferencer, identificere de produkter og tjenester, der bedst opfylder dine krav, og til at måle effektiviteten af den annoncering, vi viser for dig.
* **Håndhævelse**: Vi kan bruge de personlige oplysninger, vi indsamler, til at detektere, forhindre og reagere på svindel, brud på intellektuel ejendomsret, brud på vores vilkår og betingelser, brud på loven eller anden misbrug af vores sider.

Når det er tilladt ved lov, kan vi kombinere de oplysninger, vi indsamler via vores sider, med andre oplysninger, vi har om dig (såsom oplysninger om din brug af vores produkter og tjenester) for at tilbyde dig en forbedret og konsekvent kundeoplevelse, når du interagerer med os eller til andre formål, der er angivet i denne databeskyttelseserklæring.

**Det juridiske grundlag, hvorpå vi behandler oplysninger**

Når loven kræver det, vil vi sikre, at der er et retsgrundlag for behandlingen af dine personlige oplysninger. I de fleste tilfælde vil vores retsgrundlag afhænge af de pågældende personlige oplysninger og den specifikke kontekst, hvortil vi indsamler dem.

* **Juridisk forpligtelse**: behandlingen er nødvendig for at overholde vores juridiske forpligtelser, herunder overholdelse af gældende love, bestemmelser, statslige og kvasi-statslige anmodninger, retskendelser eller stævninger;

Hvis du har spørgsmål eller brug for yderligere oplysninger vedrørende det retsgrundlag, hvorpå vi indsamler og bruger dine personlige oplysninger, bedes du sende en e-mail til [HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com)

**Anonymisering af oplysninger**

I overensstemmelse med gældende lovgivning kan vi anonymisere dine personlige oplysninger, så de ikke længere kan bruges til at identificere dig. Anonymiserede oplysninger betragtes ikke som personlige oplysninger og er derfor ikke underlagt denne databeskyttelseserklæring. Vi kan indsamle, bruge, sammenlægge og dele anonymiserede oplysninger til ethvert formål.

**Opbevaringstiden for oplysninger**

Den periode, hvor vi gemmer dine personlige oplysninger, varierer afhængigt af formålet med behandlingen. For eksempel gemmer vi personlige oplysninger, der er nødvendige for at levere produkter og tjenester til dig, eller for at muliggøre transaktioner, du har anmodet om, så længe du er kunde hos Honeywell; eller hvis du indsender en jobansøgning via vores sider, vil vi opbevare oplysninger om din ansøgning som angivet i den databeskyttelseserklæring, der er gjort tilgængelig for dig i forbindelse med din ansøgning, eller som på anden måde krævet af loven. I alle andre tilfælde gemmer vi dine personlige oplysninger, så længe det er nødvendigt for at opfylde de formål, der er beskrevet i denne databeskyttelseserklæring, hvorefter de enten anonymiseres (hvor det er tilladt i henhold til gældende lovgivning), slettes eller destrueres.

**Videregivelse af oplysninger**

Vi kan dele dine personlige oplysninger med udvalgte tredjeparter i overensstemmelse med gældende lovgivning, herunder som angivet nedenfor:

* **Vores koncernselskaber**. Vi kan dele dine personlige oplysninger med vores datterselskaber og koncernselskaber, hvis det med rimelighed er nødvendigt til de formål, der er angivet i denne databeskyttelseserklæring.
* **Tjenesteleverandører**. Vi kan dele dine personlige oplysninger med virksomheder, som vi har indgået kontrakt med omkring levering tjenester på vegne af os, såsom hosting af hjemmesider, udførelse af undersøgelser, behandling af transaktioner, analyse af vores sider og udførelse af analyser for at forbedre kvaliteten af vores forretning, sider, produkter og tjenester. Vi kræver, at disse tjenesteleverandører beskytter fortroligheden af dine personlige oplysninger.
* **Distributører og andre betroede forretningspartnere**. Vi kan dele dine personlige oplysninger med tredjeparter, der distribuerer vores produkter og andre betroede forretningspartnere til formål, der omfatter at tillade disse tredjeparter at sende markedsføringskommunikation til dig. En sådan deling af personlige oplysninger til markedsføringsformål vil blive udført i overensstemmelse med gældende love og bestemmelser.
* **Oplysninger i forbindelse med transaktioner**. I forbindelse med visse transaktioner kan vi videregive nogle eller alle dine personlige oplysninger til finansielle institutioner, offentlige enheder og fragtvirksomheder eller posttjenester, der er involveret i gennemførelsen af transaktionen.
* **Oplysninger i forbindelse med erhvervelser eller afhændelser**. Der kan opstå omstændigheder, hvor Honeywell af strategiske eller andre forretningsmæssige årsager beslutter at sælge, købe, afhænde, fusionere eller på anden måde omorganisere virksomheder i nogle lande. Vi kan videregive oplysninger, vi opbevarer om dig, i det omfang det med rimelighed er nødvendigt for at fortsætte med forhandlingen eller gennemførelsen af en fusion, erhvervelse, afhændelse eller salg af alle eller en del af Honeywells aktiver.
* **Videregivelse af andre grunde**. Vi kan videregive personoplysninger, hvis det er påkrævet eller autoriseret i henhold til loven eller i god tro om, at en sådan handling er nødvendig for at overholde de juridiske krav eller den juridiske proces, der gælder for os, for at beskytte og forsvare vores rettigheder eller ejendom eller, i hastetilfælde, for at beskytte den enkeltes personlige sikkerhed.

**Internationale overførsler**

Honeywell er en global organisation, og dine personlige oplysninger kan overføres til, opbevares, lagres eller bruges på tværs af forskellige steder over hele verden, såsom USA, Mexico og Indien, i overensstemmelse med gældende lovgivning. Det betyder, at når vi indsamler dine personlige oplysninger, kan de blive behandlet i lande, der kan have databeskyttelseslove, der er forskellige fra lovene i dit land. Honeywell vil dog altid træffe rimelige foranstaltninger for at beskytte dine data og for at sikre et beskyttelsesniveau for personlige oplysninger, der kan sammenlignes med niveauet i dit bopælsland, herunder implementering af Europa-Kommissionens standardkontraktklausuler. Du kan få flere oplysninger om de passende sikkerhedsforanstaltninger omkring beskyttelse af personlige oplysninger ved at kontakte os på [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com).

**Sikkerhed**

Vi er dedikerede til at beskytte dine personlige oplysninger. Vi bruger tekniske og organisatoriske foranstaltninger til at levere et sikkerhedsniveau, der er passende i forhold til risikoen for at behandle dine personlige oplysninger.

**Dine rettigheder**

Afhængigt af gældende lovgivning, kan du have visse rettigheder med hensyn til dine personlige oplysninger.

* Du har muligvis ret til at **tilgå, rette, opdatere** eller **anmode om sletning** af dine personlige oplysninger.
* Du kan **modsige** behandlingen af dine personlige oplysninger, bede os om at **begrænse**behandling af dine personlige oplysninger eller anmode om **flytning** af dine personlige oplysninger.
* Du kan have ret **til ikke at få truffet en beslutning om dig, der udelukkende er baseret på automatiseret behandling, herunder profilering,** hvis denne beslutning har juridisk effekt omkring dig eller påvirker dig i væsentlig grad.
* Similarly, if we have indsamlet and proces dit personal information with dit consent, then **du kan når som helst trække dit samtykke tilbage**. Tilbagetrækning af dit samtykke vil ikke påvirke lovligheden af enhver behandling, vi foretog før din tilbagetrækning, og det vil heller ikke påvirke behandlingen af dine personlige oplysninger, der udføres under andre lovlige behandlingsgrunde end samtykket.
* Du kan have retten til **at fravælge salg af dine personlige oplysninger**. Honeywell sælger ikke dine personlige oplysninger til tredjeparter med fortjeneste for øje. Vi deler eller videregiver dog på anden måde dine personlige oplysninger til tredjeparter i overensstemmelse med denne databeskyttelseserklæring og vores [cookieerklæring](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/cookie-notice#danish). Vi samarbejder eksempelvis med tredjeparter om at distribuere vores produkter, give dig teknisk hjælp, drive hjemmesideanalytiske værktøjer og funktioner, og udføre markedsføring og salg af vores produkter og tjenester. Sådanne aktiviteter kan indebære videregivelse af dine personlige oplysninger til tredjeparter og kan betragtes som et »salg« af data i henhold til visse (men ikke alle) databeskyttelseslove.
* Du kan have ret til at **klage** til en databeskyttelsesmyndighed, der er ansvarlig for at overvåge overholdelse af databeskyttelseslovgivningen i din jurisdiktion om vores indsamling og brug af dine personlige oplysninger, hvis du mener, at vores behandling af dine personlige oplysninger ikke er i overensstemmelse med databeskyttelseslovgivningen. Personer i EØS har f.eks. ret til at indgive en klage til den kompetente databeskyttelsesmyndighed, som du kan få en liste over på: [https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members\_en](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en). Vi vil dog sætte pris på muligheden for at løse dine problemer, så du er velkommen til at kontakte os vedrørende eventuelle klager, du måtte have. Vi vil ikke diskriminere mod enkeltpersoner, der udøver deres databeskyttelsesrettigheder.

Vi vil muliggøre din udøvelse af de rettigheder, der gælder for dig i overensstemmelse med gældende lovgivning. Men selvom dine personoplysninger ikke er beskyttet i henhold til, eller på anden måde er underlagt, en databeskyttelseslov, kan vi forsøge at imødekomme enhver anmodning eller forespørgsel, du måtte have i forbindelse med vores databehandlingsaktiviteter.

**Johdanto**

Honeywell International Inc.

Tässä Tietosuojalausunnossa kerromme, miten keräämme, jaamme ja käytämme näin kerättyjä henkilötietojasi ja miten käytät oikeuttasi yksityisyyteen.

Eri alustoillamme saatat kohdata muitakin tietosuojailmoituksia yksittäisten toimintojen yhteydessä. Saatamme myös tarjota sinulle mahdollisuutta valita, miten Honeywell kulloinkin käsittelee henkilötietojasi.

**Tietojen kerääminen**

* **Suoraan sinulta kerätyt tiedot**. Saatamme pyytää sinulta henkilötietoja, jotta pyytämäsi palvelu tai tapahtuma voidaan suorittaa. Saatat lisäksi antaa meille henkilötietoja ollessasi meihin yhteydessä (esimerkiksi kommentin, tiedustelun, asiakastukipyynnön tai sivustokäynnin yhteydessä) tai rekisteröidessäsi tilin Sivustojamme käyttääksesi. Nämä henkilötiedot voivat sisältää
    * **tunnistetietoja,** kuten nimi, arvonimi, yrityksen tai organisaation nimi, sähköpostiosoite, puhelinnumerot ja postiosoite (katuosoite, postitoimipaikka, postinumero ja/tai maa)
    * **rekisteröitymistietoja,** jotka annat rekisteröityessäsi Sivustojemme käyttäjäksi (käyttäjätunnukset ja salasanat)

    * **yritysyhteystietoja,** kuten tietoja kolmannen osapuolen (esim. yrityksen, osakeyhtiön, henkilöyhtiön, toiminimen, voittoa tavoittelemattoman organisaation tai valtion viraston) muista työntekijöistä, omistajista, hallituksen jäsenistä, toimihenkilöistä tai urakoitsijoista
    * **markkinointi- ja viestintätietoja,** kuten markkinointiasetuksesi ja tiedot julkaisujemme tilauksista

    * **rekisteröitymistietoja tapahtumiin**, kuten sähköisillä rekisteröitymislomakkeilla antamasi tiedot
    * **antamaasi palautetta,** kuten kyselyissä, suosituksissa tai muutoin Sivustoistamme sekä tuotteistamme ja palveluistamme yleisesti antamasi palaute.

Jos et anna pyydettyjä tietoja, emme ehkä voi tarjota pyytämääsi palvelua tai suorittaa tiettyä transaktiota.

* **Automaattisesti sinusta kerätyt tiedot**. Keräämme tiettyjä tietoja käynneistäsi Sivustoillamme evästeiden ja vastaavien seurantatekniikoiden avulla. Kunnioitamme aina laillista oikeuttasi estää tietojen kerääminen. Näin kerätyt tiedot sisältävät

Lisätietoja Sivustoillamme käytetyistä evästeistä ja muista seurantatekniikoista saat lukemalla [Evästeilmoituksemme](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/cookie-notice#language6).

* **Maantieteelliset tiedot**. Tietyillä Sivustoilla voimme suostumuksellasi poimia tarkan, reaaliaikaisen sijaintisi mobiililaitteeltasi. Tätä tietoa käytetään vain Sivustojen käyttösi helpottamiseen meidän tai palveluntarjoajien toimesta. He saattavat käsitellä näitä tietoja palvelujen tarjoamiseksi sinulle puolestamme. Annettuasi suostumuksesi voit perua sen muuttamalla sijaintipalveluiden asetuksia mobiililaitteesi asetuksista.
* **Kolmansilta osapuolilta kerätyt tiedot**. Lain salliessa voimme kerätä henkilötietojasi kolmansilta osapuolilta, kuten sosiaalisen median sivustoilta ja sovelluksista, ja yhdistää ne jo hallussamme oleviin tietoihin parantaaksemme ja mukauttaaksemme Sivustoja mieltymystesi mukaisiksi sekä muita tässä Tietosuojalausunnossa ilmoitettuja tarkoituksia varten. Voimme myös kerätä yritysyhteystietoja työnantajaltasi tai muilta kolmansilta osapuolilta hyödyntääksemme niitä perinteiseen yritystoimintaan tai yrityksen hallinnollisiin tarkoituksiin.

**Tietojen käyttö**

Voimme käyttää Sivustojemme kautta tai yhteydenottosi yhteydessä keräämiämme henkilötietoja muun muassa seuraavia tarkoituksia varten:

* **Yritysyhteystiedot**. Honeywell kerää ja käyttää yritysyhteystietoja viestinnän tai transaktioiden tukena, kuten tuotteen tai palvelun tarjoamista tai hankintaa koskevaa asianmukaisuusvalvontaa varten. Honeywell voi kerätä ja käyttää näitä yritysyhteystietoja esimerkiksi sujuvoittaakseen ja hallinnoidakseen tilauksia, sopimuksia, takuita, huoltoa ja vastaavia liiketoimintoja, luottokelpoisuuden arviointiin ja perintään, sisäisiin compliance-tarkoituksiin ja juridisiin tarkoituksiin sekä (tarpeen vaatiessa) etujensa ja saataviensa ajamiseen.
* **Palvelut ja transaktiot**. Voimme käyttää henkilötietojasi palvelujen toimittamiseen sinulle tai pyytämiesi transaktioiden suorittamiseen, kuten tietojen toimitukseen hankkimistasi tai käytössäsi olevista Yhtiön tuotteista tai palveluista, hankittujen tuotteiden rekisteröintiin, tuotetilausten käsittelyyn, takuukorvausvaatimusten käsittelyyn, tuoteoppaiden päivitykseen, asiakaspalvelupyyntöihin vastaamiseen ja Sivustojemme käytön mahdollistamiseen.
* **Liiketoimintamme ja sivustojemme hallinnointi ja suojaaminen**. Voimme käyttää henkilötietojasi liiketoimintamme ja Sivustojemme hallinnointiin ja suojaamiseen, kuten vianmääritykseen, järjestelmän kunnossapitoon, tukeen, raportointiin ja tietojen säilyttämiseen palvelimilla.
* **Liiketoimintamme, Sivustojemme, tuotteidemme ja palveluidemme parantaminen**. Voimme käyttää henkilötietojasi liiketoiminta-analyysiin tai muihin tarkoituksiin, joilla kehitetään ja parannetaan liiketoimintamme, Sivustojemme ja tuotteidemme ja palveluittemme (myös uusien tuotteiden ja palveluiden) laatua esimerkiksi mukauttamalla Sivustoja mieltymystesi ja intressiesi mukaan.
* **Markkinointi**. Voimme käyttää henkilötietojasi lakien ja määräysten puitteissa informoidaksemme sinua tuotteista tai palveluista, jotka saattaisivat kiinnostaa sinua, sekä tuotteista, tapahtumista ja uutisista, kyselyistä, erikoistarjouksista ja näihin liittyvistä asioista. Voit kieltäytyä vastaanottamasta markkinointisähköpostiviestejä milloin tahansa kustakin viestistä löytyvää tilauksen peruutuslinkkiä käyttäen tai ottamalla meihin yhteyttä tässä Tietosuojalausunnossa annettujen yhteystietojen kautta. Asuinmaasta riippuen sinulla saattaa olla myös oikeus kieltäytyä muusta markkinointiviestinnästä. Lisätietoja saat ottamalla yhteyttä meihin Tietosuojalausunnossa mainittuja yhteystietoja käyttäen. Joillakin alueilla (esim. Kaliforniassa) yksityishenkilöillä on oikeus pyytää tietoja henkilötietojen luovuttamisesta kolmansille osapuolille suoramarkkinointitarkoituksiin. Jos haluat lisätietoa tietojen luovutusta markkinointitarkoituksiin koskevista käytännöistämme, ota meihin yhteyttä alla olevien ohjeiden mukaisesti.
* **Räätälöity mainonta**. Keräämme tietoja verkon käytöstäsi ja tunnistamme kiinnostuksesi kohteet, jotta voimme tarjota sinulle relevanttia mainontaa. Voit kieltäytyä vastaanottamasta räätälöityä mainontaa Honeywelliltä [Evästeilmoituksen](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/cookie-notice#language6) mukaisesti.
* **Kannustin- ja kanta-asiakasohjelmat**. Keräämme ja käytämme henkilötietoja kannustin- ja kanta-asiakasohjelmiemme ylläpitoa ja hallinnointia varten. Käytämme näissä ohjelmissa antamiasi henkilötietoja yksilöllisten palkintojen tarjoamiseen, ohjelmastatuksesi seurantaan sekä ohjelmapisteiden tuotteisiin, mainosmateriaaleihin, työpajoihin ja muuhun sisältöön vaihdon mahdollistamiseen. Lain salliessa saatamme käyttää kannustinohjelman puitteissa antamiasi henkilötietoja myös muuta tähän Tietosuojalausuntoon kirjattua tarkoitusta varten. Perehdy kunkin kannustinohjelman nimenomaisiin ehtoihin ennen rekisteröitymistä tai osallistumista, koska ehdot on räätälöity ohjelmakohtaisesti. Jos annat suostumuksesi ohjelmaan osallistumiseen, voit perua sen milloin tahansa ottamalla meihin yhteyttä tämän Tietosuojalausunnon lopussa olevia yhteystietoja käyttäen tai ohjelman käyttöehtojen ohjeita noudattaen.
* **Työhakemukset**. Saatat antaa meille tietoja itsestäsi työhakemuksen tai -tiedustelun yhteydessä: ansioluettelon tai CV:n, referenssejä, tietoja koulutuksesta ja aiemmista työpaikoista sekä ammatillisista tutkinnoista. Me ja konsernin muut yhtiöt voimme käyttää näitä tietoja harkitessamme työn tarjoamista, tarkistaessamme taustoja ja muutoin haun yhteydessä annetun erillisen tietosuojaselosteen tai muun ilmoituksen mukaisesti. Voimme pyytää, kerätä ja tallentaa työhakemuksia kolmatta osapuolta (rekrytointiammattilaista) tai sosiaalisen median alustaa käyttäen. Lisätietoja saat [Työnhakijan tietosuojalausunnosta](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/applicant-privacy-notice#finnish).
* **Tutkimus ja analysointi**. Voimme käyttää henkilötietojasi tutkimuksessa ja analyyseissä, joilla analysoimme ostomieltymyksiäsi, määritämme tarpeisiisi parhaiten sopivat tuotteet ja palvelut ja mittaamme sinulle esittämämme mainonnan tehoa.
* **Lainmukaisuusvalvonta**. Voimme käyttää keräämiämme henkilötietoja petosten, immateriaalioikeusloukkausten, ehtojemme rikkomusten, lainvastaisen toiminnan tai muun Sivustojemme väärinkäytön havaitsemiseen ja ehkäisyyn sekä tällaiseen toimintaan reagointiin.

Saatamme lain salliessa yhdistää Sivustojemme kautta keräämiämme tietoja muihin sinusta säilyttämiimme tietoihin (esimerkiksi tuotteidemme ja palveluidemme käyttöäsi koskeviin tietoihin) tarjotaksemme sinulle paremman ja yhtenäisen asiakaskokemuksen tai muuta tähän Tietosuojalausuntoon kirjattua tarkoitusta varten.

**Tietojen käsittelyn oikeusperuste**

Varmistamme lain niin vaatiessa, että henkilötietojesi käsittelylle on oikeusperuste. Useimmissa tapauksissa oikeusperuste riippuu kerätyistä henkilötiedoista ja keruun kontekstista.

* **Sopimusperuste**: käsittely on välttämätöntä, jotta voimme suorittaa sinulle tarjoamamme palvelut tai toimet, joita vaaditaan (pyynnöstäsi) ennen palvelujen suorittamista niihin valmistautumiseksi
* **Laillinen velvoite**: käsittely on välttämätöntä, jotta voimme täyttää lakisääteiset velvoitteemme, kuten sovellettavien lakien, asetusten, viranomaisen tai viranomaistehtävää hoitavan yksityisen yrityksen vaatimusten tai oikeuden määräysten tai haasteiden noudattamiseksi
* **Suostumusperuste**: käsittely perustuu henkilötietojesi käsittelyyn antamaasi suostumukseen yhtä tai useampaa nimettyä tarkoitusta (esim. markkinointia) varten
* **Oikeutetut edut**: käsittely on välttämätöntä oikeutetun etumme toteuttamiseksi, kuten Sivustojemme, tuotteidemme ja/tai palveluidemme kehittämiseksi ja parantamiseksi asiakkaidemme hyväksi
* **Elintärkeät edut**: käsittely on välttämätöntä elintärkeän etusi suojaamiseksi (esimerkiksi terveys- ja turvallisuussyistä, jos osallistut tapaamiseen Honeywellin toimipisteessä).

Jos sinulla on kysyttävää tai haluat lisätietoja oikeusperusteesta, jonka nojalla keräämme ja käytämme henkilötietojasi, lähetä sähköpostia osoitteeseen [HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com)

**Tietojen anonymisointi**

Saatamme anonymisoida henkilötietojasi sovellettavan lain sallimissa rajoissa siten, ettei sinua voida enää tunnistaa kyseisten tietojen perusteella. Anonymisoitujen tietojen ei katsota olevan henkilötietoja, eikä niihin sen vuoksi sovelleta tätä Tietosuojalausuntoa. Voimme kerätä, käyttää, koostaa ja jakaa anonymisoituja tietoja missä tahansa tarkoituksessa.

**Kauanko tietoja säilytetään**

Henkilötietojesi säilytysaika vaihtelee sen mukaan, missä tarkoituksessa niitä käsitellään. Säilytämme esimerkiksi tuotteiden ja palvelujen tarjoamiseen tai pyytämiesi transaktioiden mahdollistamiseen tarvittavia henkilötietoja niin kauan kuin olet Honeywellin asiakas. Jos lähetät työhakemuksen Sivustojemme kautta, säilytämme hakemuksesi tietoja sinulle haun yhteydessä annetun tietosuojailmoituksen tai lain vaatimusten mukaisesti. Kaikissa muissa tapauksissa henkilötietojasi säilytetään niin kauan kuin se on tarpeen tässä Tietosuojalausunnossa määriteltyjen tarkoitusten toteuttamiseksi, minkä jälkeen ne joko anonymisoidaan (sovellettavan lain sen salliessa), poistetaan tai tuhotaan.

**Tietojen luovuttaminen**

Saatamme luovuttaa henkilötietojasi valituille kolmansille osapuolille sovellettavan lain sallimissa rajoissa muun muassa seuraavasti.

* **Konserniyhtiömme**. Voimme luovuttaa henkilötietojasi tytäryhtiöillemme ja konserniyhtiöillemme, kun se katsotaan kohtuudella välttämättömäksi tähän Tietosuojalausuntoon kirjattua tarkoitusta varten.
* **Palveluntuottajat**. Voimme luovuttaa henkilötietojasi yrityksille, jotka toimeksiannostamme tuottavat palveluita, kuten ylläpitävät verkkosivustojamme, suorittavat kyselyitä, käsittelevät transaktioita, analysoivat Sivustojamme ja suorittavat analyyseja liiketoimintamme, Sivustojemme ja tuotteidemme ja palveluidemme laadun parantamiseksi. Edellytämme, että nämä palveluntuottajat pitävät henkilötietosi salassa.
* **Jakelijat ja muut luotetut liiketoimintakumppanit**. Voimme luovuttaa henkilötietojasi kolmansille osapuolille, jotka jakelevat tuotteitamme, ja muille luotetuille liiketoimintakumppaneillemme muun muassa siinä tarkoituksessa, että kyseiset kolmannet osapuolet voivat lähettää sinulle markkinointiviestejä. Markkinointitarkoituksiin henkilötietoja luovutetaan sovellettavien lakien ja määräysten puitteissa.
* **Transaktioihin liittyvä tietojen luovuttaminen**. Joidenkin tapahtumien yhteydessä saatamme luovuttaa kaikki tai osan meillä olevista henkilötiedoistasi rahoituslaitoksille, viranomaisille ja kuljetusyrityksille tai postipalveluille, jotka osallistuvat transaktion toteutukseen.
* **Yritysostoon tai myyntiin liittyvä tietojen luovuttaminen**. Strategisista tai muista liiketoiminnallisista syistä Honeywell saattaa päätyä myymään, ostamaan, divestoimaan, yhdistämään tai uudelleenorganisoimaan yritystoimintaa joissakin maissa. Honeywell voi luovuttaa asiakastietoja kohtuudella tarpeellisessa määrin fuusioitumista, yritysostoa tai myyntiä tai yritystoimintojen osittaista tai täysimääräistä myyntiä koskevien neuvottelujen jatkamiseksi tai loppuunsaattamiseksi.
* **Tietojen luovuttaminen muista syistä**. Voimme luovuttaa henkilötietoja oikeuksiemme tai omaisuutemme suojaamiseksi ja puolustamiseksi tai hätätilanteessa henkilön turvallisuuden suojaamiseksi, mikäli laki sitä edellyttää tai sen sallii, kun luovuttamisen perustana on käsityksemme mukaan lakisääteinen velvoite tai laillinen kanne.

**Kansainväliset tiedonsiirrot**

Honeywell on globaali organisaatio, ja henkilötietojasi voidaan siirtää eri maihin, kuten Yhdysvaltoihin, Meksikoon tai Intiaan sovellettavan lain mukaisesti sekä säilyttää, tallettaa tai käyttää näissä maissa. Tämä tarkoittaa, että kun keräämme henkilötietojasi, niitä voidaan käsitellä maissa, joiden tietosuojalait poikkeavat oman maasi laeista. Honeywell pyrkii kuitenkin aina kohtuullisiin toimin turvaamaan yksityisyytesi ja tarjoamaan oman asuinmaasi tietosuojan tasoisen henkilötietojen suojan. Näihin toimiin kuuluu Euroopan komission vakiosopimuslausekkeiden käyttö. Jos haluat lisätietoja henkilötietojesi suojaamiseksi toteutetuista toimista, ota yhteyttä sähköpostitse osoitteeseen [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com).

**Turva**

Olemme sitoutuneet pitämään henkilötietosi turvassa. Turvaamme henkilötietojasi teknisin ja organisatorisin toimin taataksemme niille käsittelyn riskeihin nähden asianmukaisen suojan. Jos haluat lisätietoja siitä, miten Honeywell suojaa henkilötietojasi, ota yhteyttä sähköpostitse osoitteeseen [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com)

**Oikeutesi**

Kulloinkin sovellettavasta laista riippuen sinulla voi olla tiettyjä henkilötietoihisi liittyviä oikeuksia.

* Sinulla voi olla oikeus **tarkastaa, korjata ja päivittää** henkilötietosi tai **pyytää niiden poistoa**.
* Voit **vastustaa** henkilötietojesi käsittelyä, pyytää meitä **rajoittamaan** henkilötietojesi käsittelyä tai esittää henkilötietojesi **siirrettävyyttä** koskevan pyynnön.
* Sinulla voi olla oikeus **estää yksinomaan automatisoituun käsittelyyn perustuva itseäsi koskeva päätöksenteko, kuten profilointi,** jos päätöksellä on sinua koskevia oikeusvaikutuksia tai se vaikuttaa sinuun merkittävästi.
* Jos henkilötietojesi keruu ja käsittely on tapahtunut suostumuksellasi, **voit perua suostumuksesi milloin tahansa**. Suostumuksesi peruminen ei vaikuta ennen perumista suoritetun käsittelyn laillisuuteen. Se ei myöskään vaikuta henkilötietojesi käsittelyyn siltä osin kuin käsittelyn oikeusperuste on muu kuin suostumus.
* Sinulla voi olla oikeus kieltää **henkilötietojesi myynti edelleen**. Honeywell ei myy henkilötietojasi kolmansille osapuolille saadakseen taloudellista hyötyä. Me kuitenkin jaamme tai luovutamme henkilötietojasi kolmansille osapuolille tämän Tietosuojalausunnon ja [Evästeilmoituksemme](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/cookie-notice#language6) rajauksin. Ulkoistamme kolmansille osapuolille esimerkiksi jälleenmyyntiä, teknisen tuen tarjoamista, verkkosivustojen analytiikkaa sekä tuotteiden ja palveluiden markkinointia ja myyntiä. Tällaiseen toimintaan voi liittyä henkilökohtaisten tietojesi luovuttaminen kolmansille osapuolille, joka voidaan katsoa tietojen myynniksi joidenkin (mutta ei kaikkien) tietosuojalakien nojalla.
* Sinulla on oikeus **tehdä valitus** sille tietosuojaviranomaiselle, joka vastaa henkilötietojen keruuta ja käyttöä koskevasta laillisuusvalvonnasta omassa maassasi, jos uskot meidän käsittelevän henkilötietojasi tietosuojalain vastaisesti. Esimerkiksi Euroopan talousalueella henkilö voi tehdä valituksen toimivaltaiselle tietosuojaviranomaiselle, jotka on listattu osoitteessa [https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members\_fi](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_fi).

**Anonymisation des informations**

Conformément à la législation applicable, nous pouvons anonymiser vos informations personnelles afin qu’elles ne puissent plus être utilisées pour vous identifier.

Nous pouvons collecter, utiliser, regrouper et partager des informations anonymisées à n’importe quelle fin.

**Combien de temps conservons-nous les informations ?**

La période durant laquelle nous stockons vos informations personnelles varie en fonction de l’objectif du traitement.

Dans tous les autres cas, nous conservons vos informations personnelles aussi longtemps que nécessaire pour atteindre les objectifs énoncés dans la présente Déclaration de confidentialité, après quoi elles seront anonymisées (lorsque la loi l’autorise), supprimées ou détruites.

**Divulgation des informations**

Conformément à la législation applicable, nous pouvons partager vos informations personnelles avec des tiers sélectionnés, y compris de la manière indiquée ci-dessous :

* **Les sociétés du groupe**. Nous pouvons partager vos informations personnelles avec les filiales et sociétés du groupe dans la mesure où cela est raisonnablement nécessaire aux fins énoncées dans la présente Déclaration de confidentialité.

* **Divulgations en lien avec des acquisitions ou des cessions**. Dans certains cas, Honeywell peut décider pour des raisons stratégiques ou d’autres motifs d’affaires de vendre, d’acheter, de fusionner ou de réorganiser des activités dans certains pays.

**Transferts internationaux**

Honeywell est une société mondiale et vos informations personnelles peuvent être transmises, conservées, stockées ou utilisées dans diverses implantations du monde entier, tel qu’aux États-Unis, au Mexique et en Inde conformément à la législation en vigueur. Cela signifie que lorsque nous recueillons vos informations personnelles, elles peuvent être traitées dans des pays qui peuvent disposer de lois sur la protection des données qui sont différentes des lois de votre pays. Cependant, Honeywell prendra toujours des mesures raisonnables pour protéger votre vie privée et fournir un niveau de protection des informations personnelles comparable à celui de votre pays de résidence, ce qui inclut la mise en œuvre des Clauses contractuelles types de la Commission européenne. Pour de plus amples informations sur les mesures de protection appropriées qui ont été mises en place pour protéger vos informations personnelles, veuillez nous contacter à l’adresse [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com).

* De même, si nous avons recueilli et traité vos informations personnelles avec votre consentement, **vous pouvez retirer votre consentement à tout moment**. Le retrait de votre consentement n’affectera en rien la légalité des traitements que nous avons effectués avant votre retrait, et cela n’affectera pas le traitement de vos informations personnelles effectué en se fondant sur des motifs de traitement licites autres que le consentement.
* Vous pouvez avoir le droit de **refuser la vente de vos informations personnelles**. Honeywell ne vend pas vos informations personnelles à des tiers afin d’en tirer profit. Toutefois, nous partageons ou divulguons vos informations personnelles à des tiers conformément à la présente Déclaration de confidentialité et à notre [Avis relatif aux cookies](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/cookie-notice#french). Par exemple, nous collaborons avec des tiers pour distribuer nos produits, vous fournir une assistance technique, exploiter des outils et des fonctionnalités analytiques du site Web, et procéder à la commercialisation et à la vente de nos produits et services. Ces activités peuvent impliquer la divulgation de vos informations personnelles à des tiers et peuvent être considérées comme une « vente » de données en vertu de certaines lois (mais pas toutes) sur la protection des données.
* Vous avez le droit de **porter plainte auprès** d’une autorité de protection des données responsable de l’application de la loi sur la protection des données dans votre juridiction concernant la collecte et l’utilisation de vos données personnelles si vous pensez que le traitement de vos données personnelles ne respecte pas la loi sur la protection des données. Par exemple, les personnes de l’EEE ont le droit de déposer une plainte auprès de l’autorité compétente en matière de protection des données, dont la liste est accessible à l’adresse suivante : [https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members\_en](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en).

Nous n’exercerons aucune discrimination à l’encontre de personnes ayant exercé leurs droits à la confidentialité des données.

Cependant, même si vos informations personnelles ne sont pas protégées par une loi sur la protection des données, ou autrement assujetties à cette législation, nous pouvons nous efforcer de répondre à toute demande ou requête que vous pourriez avoir en ce qui concerne nos activités de traitement de données.

Conformément à la loi applicable, nous pouvons recueillir des renseignements personnels vous concernant auprès de tiers, comme des sites Web ou des applications de médias sociaux, et les combiner aux renseignements que nous détenons déjà afin de nous aider à améliorer et à personnaliser nos Sites selon vos préférences ainsi qu’à d’autres fins indiquées dans cet énoncé de confidentialité. Nous pouvons également recueillir vos coordonnées professionnelles auprès de votre employeur ou d’autres tiers afin de faciliter ou d’entreprendre des activités commerciales traditionnelles et des questions administratives similaires.

**La façon dont nous utilisons l’information**

Nous pouvons utiliser les renseignements personnels recueillis sur nos Sites ou lorsque vous communiquez avec nous aux fins suivantes :

* **Coordonnées professionnelles**. Honeywell collecte et utilise les coordonnées professionnelles afin d’effectuer des communications ou des transactions, y compris pour réaliser une vérification au préalable sur un produit ou un service ou la prestation ou réception d’un produit ou d’un service. Par exemple, Honeywell peut collecter et utiliser ces coordonnées professionnelles afin de faciliter et de gérer les commandes, les contrats, les garanties, la maintenance et des fonctions professionnelles similaires à des fins d’analyse du crédit et de collecte, pour nous assister dans le cadre de nos obligations juridiques et de conformité internes, et, si nécessaire, de défendre nos intérêts et nos demandes.
* **Services et transactions**. Nous pouvons utiliser vos renseignements personnels pour vous fournir des services ou effectuer des transactions que vous avez demandées, y compris, mais sans s’y limiter, pour vous fournir des informations sur des produits ou des services de la Société que vous avez achetés ou que vous utilisez, enregistrer des produits achetés, traiter des commandes de produits, traiter des réclamations sous garantie, remplacer des manuels des produits, répondre aux questions adressées au service à la clientèle et faciliter l’utilisation de nos Sites.
* **Gestion et protection de notre entreprise et de nos Sites**. Nous pouvons utiliser vos renseignements personnels pour gérer et protéger nos activités et nos Sites, y compris le dépannage, la maintenance du système, le soutien, la production de rapport et l’hébergement des données.

Nous pouvons utiliser vos renseignements personnels aux fins d’analyses commerciales ou à d’autres fins qui nous aident à développer et à améliorer la qualité de divers aspects de notre entreprise, de nos Sites et de nos produits et services (y compris les nouveaux produits et services), par exemple en adaptant nos Sites à vos préférences et à vos champs d’intérêt.
* **Marketing**. Conformément aux lois et réglementations applicables, nous pouvons utiliser vos renseignements personnels pour vous informer des produits ou des services susceptibles de vous intéresser et pour communiquer avec vous concernant des offres, des événements, des nouvelles, des sondages, des offres spéciales et des sujets connexes. Vous pouvez vous désabonner des communications marketing envoyées par courriel en tout temps en cliquant sur le lien de désabonnement figurant dans tout matériel de marketing par courriel que nous vous envoyons ou en communiquant avec nous à l’aide des coordonnées indiquées dans cet énoncé de confidentialité. Selon votre pays de résidence, vous pouvez également vous désabonner d’autres types de communications marketing; veuillez communiquer avec nous à l’aide des coordonnées indiquées dans l’énoncé de confidentialité pour plus d’informations. Certaines administrations (p. ex. les résidents de Californie) donnent aux personnes le droit de demander certaines informations concernant notre divulgation de renseignements personnels à des tiers à des fins de marketing direct. Pour de plus amples informations sur nos pratiques en matière de divulgation de données à des fins de marketing, veuillez nous contacter en suivant les directives ci-dessous.
* **Publicités ciblées par centre d’intérêt**. Nous collectons des données sur vos activités en ligne et déterminons vos centres d’intérêt afin de pouvoir vous proposer les publicités les plus pertinentes pour votre profil. Vous pouvez refuser de recevoir de la part de Honeywell des publicités ciblées par centre d’intérêt, comme décrit dans notre [Avis relatif aux témoins](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/cookie-notice#french-canadian).
* **Programmes d’incitation financière et de fidélité**. Nous collectons et utilisons des renseignements personnels pour gérer et administrer nos programmes d’incitation financière et de fidélité. Nous utilisons les renseignements personnels que vous fournissez dans le cadre de ces programmes pour offrir des récompenses uniques, suivre l’état de votre programme et faciliter l’échange de points de programme pour des produits, du matériel promotionnel, des ateliers de formation et d’autres articles. Dans la mesure permise par la loi, nous pouvons également utiliser les renseignements personnels que vous fournissez dans le cadre d’un programme d’incitation financière pour toute autre fin énoncée dans la présente Déclaration de confidentialité. Veuillez consulter les conditions générales de chaque programme d’incitation financière dans lequel vous souhaitez vous inscrire ou auquel vous souhaitez participer, car ces conditions générales peuvent être adaptées avec précision au programme applicable. Si vous acceptez de participer à ces programmes, vous pouvez à tout moment communiquer avec nous en utilisant les coordonnées à la fin de la présente Déclaration de confidentialité ou en suivant les instructions détaillées des conditions générales du programme en vigueur.
* **Demandes d’emploi**. Dans le cadre d’un renseignement ou d’une demande d’emploi, vous pourriez nous fournir des renseignements personnels, comme votre CV, des références professionnelles, des renseignements sur votre scolarité et vos antécédents d’emploi, ainsi que des renseignements sur vos formations ou certifications professionnelles. Les membres de notre groupe et nous-mêmes pouvons utiliser ces renseignements à des fins de recrutement, de vérification des antécédents et d’admissibilité à l’emploi, et tel qu’établi dans toute Déclaration de confidentialité ou tout autre avis distinct disponible en relation avec votre demande. Nous pouvons utiliser un tiers (p. ex. un recruteur) ou une plateforme de médias sociaux pour solliciter, collecter et conserver les demandes d’emploi. Pour plus d’informations, veuillez lire notre [Avis de confidentialité du candidat](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/applicant-privacy-notice#french-canadian).
* **Recherche et analyse**. Nous pouvons utiliser vos renseignements personnels pour effectuer des recherches et des analyses afin de nous aider à examiner vos préférences d’achat, à déterminer les produits et services qui répondent le mieux à vos besoins et à mesurer l’efficacité de la publicité que nous vous présentons.
* **Application**: Nous pouvons utiliser les renseignements personnels que nous recueillons afin de détecter, de prévenir et de combattre la fraude, l’utilisation abusive de nos Sites et la violation de la propriété intellectuelle, de nos conditions générales et des lois.

Si la loi le permet, nous pouvons combiner les renseignements que nous recueillons sur nos Sites à d’autres renseignements vous concernant que nous détenons (comme des renseignements sur votre utilisation de nos produits et services) afin de vous offrir une expérience client améliorée et cohérente lorsque vous interagissez avec nous ou à d’autres fins indiquées dans cet énoncé de confidentialité.

**Le fondement juridique sur lequel s’appuie notre traitement des renseignements**

Lorsque la loi l’exige, nous nous assurons qu’il existe un fondement juridique pour le traitement de vos renseignements personnels. Dans la plupart des cas, notre fondement juridique pour la collecte et l’utilisation des renseignements personnels décrits dans le présent Avis de confidentialité dépendra des renseignements personnels applicables et du contexte spécifique dans lequel nous les recueillons.

* **Contrat** : le traitement est nécessaire pour l’exécution des services que nous vous fournissons ou afin de prendre les mesures (à votre demande) avant et en prévision de l’exécution de ces services;
* **Obligation juridique** : le traitement est nécessaire pour nous conformer à nos obligations légales, y compris le respect des lois, des règlements, des demandes gouvernementales et quasi gouvernementales, des ordonnances ou des citations à comparaître applicables;
* **Consentement** : le traitement est fondé sur votre consentement au traitement de vos renseignements personnels à une ou plusieurs fins précisées (par exemple, à des fins de marketing);
* **Intérêts légitimes** : le traitement est nécessaire pour répondre à nos intérêts légitimes, par exemple pour développer et améliorer nos Sites, nos produits ou nos services au profit de nos clients.
* **Intérêts vitaux** : le traitement est nécessaire pour protéger vos intérêts vitaux (par exemple, pour des raisons de santé et de sécurité si vous assistez à une réunion dans un établissement Honeywell).

Si vous avez des questions ou avez besoin d’autres renseignements en ce qui concerne le fondement juridique de notre collecte et de notre utilisation de vos renseignements personnels, veuillez envoyer un courriel à [HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com).

**L’anonymisation des informations**

Conformément à la loi applicable, nous pouvons anonymiser vos renseignements personnels afin qu’ils ne puissent plus être utilisés pour vous identifier. Les renseignements anonymisés ne sont pas considérés comme des renseignements personnels; ils ne sont donc pas assujettis à cet énoncé de confidentialité. Nous pouvons recueillir, utiliser, regrouper et partager des renseignements anonymisés à n’importe quelle fin.

**Durée de conservation des renseignements**

La période durant laquelle nous conservons vos renseignements personnels varie en fonction de l’objectif de traitement. Par exemple, nous conservons les renseignements personnels nécessaires pour vous fournir des produits et des services ou pour faciliter les transactions que vous avez demandées aussi longtemps que vous êtes un client de Honeywell ou si vous soumettez une demande d’emploi sur nos Sites, nous conserverons les détails de votre demande comme l’indique l’énoncé de confidentialité ou tout autre avis mis à votre disposition dans le cadre de votre demande ou comme la loi l’exige. Dans tous les autres cas, nous conservons vos renseignements personnels aussi longtemps que nécessaire aux fins décrites dans cet énoncé de confidentialité, après quoi ils sont anonymisés (lorsque la loi applicable le permet), supprimés ou détruits.

**Divulgation des informations**

Nous pouvons partager vos renseignements personnels avec des tiers sélectionnés conformément à la loi applicable, y compris comme indiqué ci-dessous :

* **Les sociétés de notre groupe**. Nous pouvons partager vos renseignements personnels avec nos sociétés affiliées et les sociétés de notre groupe pour des utilisations raisonnablement nécessaires aux fins décrites dans le présent énoncé de confidentialité.
* **Les fournisseurs de services**. Nous pouvons partager vos renseignements personnels avec des entreprises que nous avons engagées pour la prestation de services pour notre compte, comme l’hébergement de sites Web, la réalisation de sondages, le traitement de transactions, l’analyse de nos Sites et la production d’analyses pour améliorer la qualité de divers aspects de notre entreprise, de nos Sites et de nos produits et services. Nous exigeons que ces fournisseurs de services protègent la confidentialité de vos renseignements personnels.
* **Les distributeurs et autres partenaires commerciaux de confiance**. Nous pourrions partager vos renseignements personnels avec des tiers qui distribuent nos produits et avec d’autres partenaires commerciaux de confiance à des fins comprenant la possibilité que ces tiers communiquent avec vous à des fins de marketing. Le partage de renseignements personnels à des fins de marketing sera effectué conformément aux lois et règlements applicables.
* **Divulgation de renseignements dans le contexte d’une transaction**. Dans le cadre de certaines transactions, nous pourrions divulguer une partie ou l’intégralité de vos renseignements personnels aux institutions financières, entités gouvernementales et sociétés d’expédition ou services postaux qui participent à l’exécution de la transaction.
* **Divulgation en lien avec des acquisitions ou des cessions**. Dans certaines circonstances, il est possible que la Société décide, pour des questions stratégiques ou d’autres raisons professionnelles, de vendre, d’acheter, de désinvestir, de fusionner ou de réorganiser autrement les activités dans certains pays ou de se départir de ces activités. Il se peut que nous divulguions des renseignements à votre sujet dans la mesure nécessaire à juste titre afin de mener les négociations, voire de procéder à la fusion, à l’acquisition, au désinvestissement ou à la vente des actifs de Honeywell en tout ou en partie.
* **Divulgation pour d’autres motifs**. Nous pouvons divulguer des renseignements personnels si la loi l’exige ou l’autorise ou si nous jugeons en toute bonne foi qu’une telle action est nécessaire pour nous conformer à des obligations légales ou à des recours en droit exercés à notre égard, pour protéger et défendre nos droits et nos biens, ou dans des circonstances urgentes de protection de la sécurité personnelle de tout individu.

**Transferts internationaux**

Compte tenu du fait que Honeywell est une organisation internationale, vos renseignements personnels peuvent être transférés, détenus, conservés ou utilisés sur différentes plateformes à travers le monde, par exemple aux États-Unis, au Mexique et en Inde conformément aux lois applicables. Cela signifie que lorsque nous recueillons vos renseignements, ceux-ci peuvent être traités dans des pays appliquant des lois sur la protection des données différentes des lois de votre pays. Toutefois, Honeywell prendra toujours des mesures raisonnables pour protéger votre vie privée et pour assurer un niveau de protection des renseignements personnels comparable à celui de votre pays de résidence, y compris par la mise en œuvre des clauses contractuelles standard de la Commission européenne. Pour de plus amples informations sur les mesures de protection appropriées qui ont été mises en place pour protéger vos renseignements personnels, veuillez nous contacter à l’adresse [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com).

**Sécurité**

Nous nous engageons à protéger la sécurité de vos renseignements personnels. Nous avons recours à des mesures techniques et organisationnelles pour fournir un niveau de sécurité adapté au risque de traitement de vos renseignements personnels. Pour plus d’informations sur la façon dont Honeywell protège vos renseignements personnels, veuillez nous contacter à l’adresse [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com).

**Vos droits**

Selon la loi en vigueur, vous pouvez disposer de certains droits quant à vos renseignements personnels.

* Vous pouvez avoir le droit **d’accéder, de corriger, de mettre à jour** ou **de demander la suppression** de vos renseignements personnels.
* Vous pouvez vous **opposer** au traitement de vos renseignements personnels, nous demander de **restreindre** le traitement de vos renseignements personnels ou demander la **transférabilité** de vos renseignements personnels.
* Vous disposez du droit **de refuser qu’une décision soit prise uniquement sur la base d’un traitement automatisé, y compris le profilage,** si cette décision génère des effets juridiques à votre encontre ou vous affecte de manière significative.
* De la même façon, si nous avons recueilli et traité vos renseignements personnels avec votre consentement, **vous pouvez retirer votre consentement en tout temps**. Le retrait de votre consentement n’aura aucune incidence sur la légalité de tout traitement que nous avons effectué avant votre retrait, et cela n’affectera pas le traitement de vos renseignements personnels reposant sur des motifs de traitement licites autres que le consentement.
* Vous pouvez avoir le droit de **refuser la vente de vos renseignements personnels**. Honeywell ne vend pas vos renseignements personnels à des tiers afin d’en tirer profit. Toutefois, nous partageons ou divulguons vos renseignements personnels à des tiers conformément à la présente Déclaration de confidentialité et à notre [Avis relatif aux témoins](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/cookie-notice#french-canadian). Par exemple, nous collaborons avec des tiers pour distribuer nos produits, vous fournir une assistance technique, exploiter des outils et des fonctionnalités analytiques du site Web, et procéder à la commercialisation et à la vente de nos produits et services. Ces activités peuvent impliquer la divulgation de vos renseignements personnels à des tiers et peuvent être considérées comme une « vente » de données en vertu de certaines lois (mais pas toutes) sur la protection des données.
* Vous avez le droit de **porter plainte auprès** d’une autorité de protection des données responsable de l’application de la loi sur la protection des données dans votre juridiction concernant la collecte et l’utilisation de vos renseignements personnels si vous pensez que le traitement de vos renseignements personnels ne respecte pas la loi sur la protection des données. Par exemple, les personnes de l’EEE ont le droit de déposer une plainte auprès de l’autorité compétente en matière de protection des données, dont la liste est accessible à l’adresse suivante : [https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members\_en](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en). Nous serions toutefois reconnaissants d’avoir l’occasion de répondre à vos préoccupations, alors n’hésitez pas à communiquer avec nous pour toute plainte que vous pourriez avoir. Nous n’exercerons aucune discrimination à l’encontre de personnes ayant exercé leurs droits à la confidentialité des données.

Nous faciliterons l’exercice des droits qui s’appliquent à vous conformément aux lois applicables. Cependant, même si vos renseignements personnels ne sont pas protégés par une loi sur la protection des données, ou autrement assujettis à cette législation, nous pouvons nous efforcer de répondre à toute demande ou requête que vous pourriez avoir en ce qui concerne nos activités de traitement de données. Si vous avez des questions concernant vos droits ou souhaitez exercer vos droits, vous pouvez communiquer avec nous à l’adresse [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com) ou envoyer des questions relatives à la confidentialité en utilisant notre formulaire Web interactif en cliquant sur lien suivant :

Si vous êtes mineur au sens des lois de votre pays, veuillez ne pas transmettre de renseignements personnels sur nos Sites.

**Liens vers d’autres sites Web**

Nos sites peuvent contenir des liens vers des sites Web, des produits et des services de tiers.

**Rechtliche Grundlage für die Verarbeitung von Informationen**

In den meisten Fällen ist unsere Rechtsgrundlage von den betreffenden personenbezogenen Daten und dem spezifischen Kontext abhängig, in dem wir die Daten erheben.

Wenn Sie Fragen haben oder weitere Informationen zur Rechtsgrundlage benötigen, anhand derer wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten erfassen und verwenden, senden Sie bitte eine E-Mail an [HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com)

**Anonymisierung von Informationen**

Gemäß geltendem Recht kann es sein, dass wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten anonymisieren, sodass sie nicht mehr verwendet werden können, um Sie zu identifizieren. Anonymisierte Informationen gelten nicht als personenbezogene Daten und unterliegen daher nicht dieser Datenschutzerklärung. Wir können anonymisierte Informationen zu jedem Zweck erheben, verwenden, aggregieren und weitergeben.

**Dauer der Aufbewahrung von Informationen**

Der Zeitraum, über den wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten speichern, ist vom Zweck der Verarbeitung abhängig. Personenbezogene Daten, die wir benötigen, um Ihnen Produkte und Dienstleistungen zur Verfügung zu stellen oder um Transaktionen zu ermöglichen, die Sie angefordert haben, speichern wir beispielsweise, solange Sie Kunde von Honeywell sind. Wenn Sie eine Bewerbung über unsere Sites einreichen, bewahren wir Informationen über Ihre Bewerbung wie in der Datenschutzerklärung, die Ihnen im Zusammenhang mit Ihrer Bewerbung zur Verfügung gestellt wurde, dargelegt oder wie anderweitig gesetzlich vorgeschrieben auf. In allen anderen Fällen speichern wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten solange wie notwendig, um die in dieser Datenschutzerklärung beschriebenen Zwecke zu erfüllen. Anschließend werden sie entweder anonymisiert (soweit gesetzlich zulässig), gelöscht oder vernichtet.

**Offenlegung von Informationen**

Gemäß geltendem Gesetz geben wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten möglicherweise an ausgewählte Dritte weiter, einschließlich der im Folgenden beschriebenen Dritten:

**Bevezetés**

A Honeywell International Inc. (a továbbiakban „**Honeywell**” vagy „**mi**”) adatkezelőként jár el azoknak az adatoknak az esetében, amelyeket akkor gyűjtünk, amikor Ön felkeresi vagy használja bármelyik webhelyünket, vagy amikor a jelen Adatvédelmi nyilatkozat hatálya alá eső termékeket, szolgáltatásokat és alkalmazásokat használ (együttesen: „**Webhelyeink**”). A jelen Adatvédelmi nyilatkozat ismerteti, hogyan gyűjtjük, osztjuk meg és használjuk fel a fent ismertetett módon gyűjtött személyes adatokat, és leírja, hogyan gyakorolhatja Ön az adatvédelemhez fűződő jogait.

Amikor kapcsolatba lépünk Önnel, további adatvédelmi tájékoztatókat is küldhetünk az egyes konkrét adatkezelési tevékenységekre vonatkozóan, vagy további választási lehetőségeket kínálhatunk a Honeywell által az Ön adatain az adott esetben végzett adatkezelési tevékenységek kapcsán.

**Az általunk végzett adatgyűjtés**

* **Közvetlenül Öntől gyűjtött adatok**. A szolgáltatások biztosításához, valamint a kért tranzakciók végrehajtásához szükség esetén személyes adatokat kérünk Öntől. Emellett akkor is megadhat nekünk személyes adatokat, amikor Ön veszi fel velünk a kapcsolatot vagy valamilyen interakcióba lép velünk (például kommentet ír, érdeklődést vagy ügyfélszolgálati megkeresést küld be, esetleg felkeresi az oldalainkat), vagy felhasználói fiókot hoz létre Webhelyeink használatához. Ezeknek a személyes adatoknak a körébe az alábbiak tartoznak:
    * **Személyazonosító adatok,** például név, cím, vállalat/szervezet neve, e-mail-cím, telefon- és faxszám és postacím (utca, település, állam, irányítószám és/vagy ország);
    * **Regisztrációs adatok**, azaz a webhelyeink használatához szükséges fiók regisztrálása során megadott adatok, például felhasználónév és jelszó;
    * **Munkaerő-felvétellel kapcsolatos adatok,** ideértve a meghirdetett állásokkal vagy a beküldött érdeklődésekkel kapcsolatban megadott információkat (ezeket alább ismertetjük);
    * **Üzleti kapcsolattartási adatok,** például egy harmadik szervezet (például vállalkozás, cég, társaság, egyéni vállalkozás, nonprofit szervezet vagy kormányzati szerv) alkalmazottjaira, tulajdonosaira, igazgatóira, tisztségviselőire vagy alvállalkozóira vonatkozó információk,
    * **Marketing- és kommunikációs adatok,** ideértve a marketingpreferenciákat és a kiadványainkra vonatkozó előfizetéseket;
    * **Pénzügyi adatok,** például bankkártya- és egyéb számlaadatok a webhelyeinken elérhető termékek és szolgáltatások megvásárlásának elősegítése érdekében;
    * **Exportellenőrzési adatok,** például nemzetiség, állampolgárság és lakhely szerinti ország, amelyek segítségével meghatározhatjuk, hogy az exportellenőrzési rendeletek értelmében küldhetünk-e Önnek információkat bizonyos technológiákról;
    * **Tranzakciós adatok,** ideértve a termékeinkkel és a szolgáltatásainkkal kapcsolatos érdeklődések, megrendelések és az Önnek küldött, valamint az Öntől fogadott kifizetések részleteit, valamint a megrendelési előzményeket és a fizetési tranzakciók lebonyolításához szükséges információkat;
    * **Eseményregisztrációval kapcsolatos adatok,** többek között az e-regisztrációs űrlapok kitöltése során megadott adatok; és
    * **Az Ön visszajelzései,** beleértve a felméréseket, az ajánlásokat és más, a Webhelyeinkkel, valamint a termékeinkkel és szolgáltatásainkkal kapcsolatos általános visszajelzéseket.

Ha nem adja meg a kért adatokat, előfordulhat, hogy nem tudjuk Önnek biztosítani a kért szolgáltatást, vagy nem tudjuk teljesíteni tranzakcióit.

* **Az Önről automatikusan gyűjtött adatok**. Bizonyos információkat cookie-k és hasonló nyomkövető technológiák segítségével rögzítünk a Webhelyeinken tett látogatásáról. Ha Önnek joga van letiltani az ilyen adatgyűjtést, ezt a kérését minden esetben tiszteletben tartjuk. Az ilyen módon gyűjtött adatok közé a következők tartoznak:
    * **Használati adatok,** például azzal kapcsolatos adatok, hogy Ön hogyan használja a Webhelyeket, a megtekintett oldalak, az átvitt bájtok száma, a megnyitott hivatkozások, a megtekintett anyagok, a Webhely megnyitásának dátuma és időpontja, a webhely, amelyről a mi Webhelyünkre érkezett, valamint a Webhelyen végzett egyéb műveletek; és
    * **Technikai adatok,** például IP-cím, a böngésző típusa, valamint az operációs rendszer jellemzői és nyelve.

A Webhelyeinken használt cookie-król és más hasonló nyomkövető technológiákról a [Cookie-kkal kapcsolatos közleményben](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/cookie-notice#hungarian) olvashat.

* **Földrajzi helyekkel kapcsolatos adatok**. Egyes Webhelyek esetén az Ön hozzájárulásával rögzíthetjük a mobileszköz pontos, valós idejű helyét (azaz az eszköz helyadatait). Ezeket az adatokat kizárólag arra használjuk fel, hogy lehetővé tegyük Önnek a Webhelyek használatát. Az általunk különböző szolgáltatások biztosításával megbízott partnerek is kizárólag ebből a célból dolgozzák fel ezeket az adatokat. A hozzájárulást a későbbiekben a mobileszköz helyadatokkal kapcsolatos beállításaiban módosíthatja.
* **Harmadik felektől gyűjtött adatok**. A hatályos törvények betartásával harmadik felektől, például közösségimédia-webhelyekről és -alkalmazásokból is gyűjthetünk adatokat Önről, amlyeket az Önről más forrásokból gyűjtött információkkal kombinálhatunk. Ezekat az adatokat Webhelyeink fejlesztésére és az Ön igényei szerinti személyre szabására, valamint a jelen Adatvédelmi nyilatkozatban meghatározott egyéb célokra használhatjuk fel. Emellett az Ön munkáltatójától vagy más harmadik felektől is gyűjthetünk üzleti kapcsolattartási adatokat Önről, amelyeket a szokásos üzleti tevékenységek és adminisztratív feladatok elvégzésére használunk fel.

**Az adatok felhasználása**

A Webhelyeinken keresztül, valamint a velünk való kapcsolatfelvétel során gyűjtött személyes adatokat többek között az alábbi célokra használhatjuk fel:

* **Üzleti kapcsolattartási adatok**. A Honeywell a kapcsolat felvétele vagy tranzakciók lebonyolítása céljából gyűjti össze és használja fel az üzleti kapcsolattartási adatokat. Ilyen tevékenység lehet például a termék vagy szolgáltatások biztosításával vagy fogadásával kapcsolatos átvilágítás. A Honeywell például összegyűjtheti és felhasználhatja az üzleti kapcsolattartási adatokat a megrendelések, a szerződések, a jótállások, a karbantartási tevékenységek és más, hasonló üzleti feladatkörök elvégzése és kezelése érdekében, hitelelemzési és behajtási célokra, saját belső megfelelőségi és jogi követelményeink teljesítése érdekében, valamint (szükség esetén) érdekeink és követeléseink védelmére.
* **Szolgáltatások és tranzakciók**. Személyes adatait felhasználhatjuk az Ön által kért szolgáltatások biztosítására és tranzakciók lebonyolítására, ideértve többek között a következőket: a megvásárolt vagy használt vállalati termékekkel és szolgáltatásokkal kapcsolatos tájékoztatás, megvásárolt termékek regisztrálása, megrendelések feldolgozása, jótállási igények kezelése, kézikönyvek cseréje, ügyfélszolgálati kérések megválaszolása és a Webhelyeink használatának elősegítése.
* **Üzleti tevékenységünk és Webhelyeink kezelése és védelme** Személyes adatait felhasználhatjuk üzleti tevékenységünk és Webhelyeink kezelésére és védelmére, ideértve többek között a hibaelhárítást, a rendszerkarbantartást, a támogatást, a jelentések készítését és az adatok hosztolását.
* **Üzleti tevékenységünk, Webhelyeink, termékeink és szolgáltatásaink fejlesztése**. Személyes adatait felhasználhatjuk üzleti elemzések készítéséhez, valamint üzleti tevékenységünk, Webhelyeink, termékeink és szolgáltatásaink minőségének fejlesztését szolgáló további célokra (az új termékeket és szolgáltatásokat is beleértve), például arra, hogy Webhelyeinket az Ön preferenciáinak és érdeklődési körének megfelelően személyre szabjuk.
* **Marketing**. A hatályos törvényeknek és rendeleteknek megfelelően személyes adatait felhasználhatjuk arra, hogy tájékoztassuk azokról a termékekről és szolgáltatásokról, amelyek érdekelhetik Önt, és más módokon is megkeressük Önt különböző ajánlatok, események, hírek, felmérések, különleges ajánlatok és más, hasonló témák kapcsán. Az e-mailben kapott marketingkommunikációs anyagokról bármikor díjmentesen leiratkozhat. Ehhez kattintson a tőlünk kapott e-marketing anyagokban található „Leiratkozás” hivatkozásra, vagy vegye fel velünk a kapcsolatot a jelen Adatvédelmi nyilatkozatban felsorolt elérhetőségek egyikén. A lakóhelye szerinti országtól függően előfordulhat, hogy más típusú marketingkommunikációs anyagokról is leiratkozhat; további információért vegye fel velünk a kapcsolatot a jelen Adatvédelmi nyilatkozatban felsorolt elérhetőségek egyikén. Egyes joghatóságok (például Kalifornia) lehetővé teszik, hogy polgáraik tájékoztatást kérjenek tőlünk arról, hogy milyen személyes adataikat adjuk át harmadik feleknek közvetlen üzletszerzési célokra. Ha szeretne többet tudni az adatok marketingcélú továbbítására vonatkozó gyakorlatunkról, vegye fel velünk a kapcsolatot az alábbiakban olvasható utasításokat követve.
* **Érdeklődésen alapuló hirdetések**. Adatokat gyűjtünk az interneten Ön által végzett tevékenységekről, és ezek alapján azonosítjuk az érdeklődési köreit, hogy így relevánsabb hirdetéseket tudjunk megjeleníteni Önnek. A Honeywell érdeklődésen alapuló hirdetéseiről a [Cookie-kkal kapcsolatos közleményben](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/cookie-notice#hungarian) leírtak szerint iratkozhat le.
* **Pénzügyi ösztönzők és hűségprogramok**. Pénzügyi ösztönzőink és hűségprogramjaink működtetéséhez és kezeléséhez is személyes adatokat gyűjtünk és használunk fel. Az Ön által e programok kapcsán megadott személyes adatokat arra használjuk fel, hogy egyedi jutalmakat ajánljunk fel, nyomon kövessük a program státuszát, és lehetővé tegyük a programban szerzett pontok termékekre, promóciós anyagokra, képzésekre és másokra való beváltását. A jogszabályok által megengedett mértékben a pénzügyi ösztönzőprogramok keretében megadott személyes adatokat a jelen Adatvédelmi nyilatkozatban meghatározott egyéb célokra is felhasználhatjuk. Ha szeretne regisztrálni egy ilyen pénzügyi ösztönzőprogramra, vagy részt venni valamelyik programban, olvassa el a program feltételeit, mivel bizonyos esetekben ezek a feltételek kizárólag az adott programra vonatkozó információkat tartalmaznak. Ha vállalja, hogy részt vesz egy ilyen programban, bármikor visszavonhatja ezt a hozzájárulását. Ehhez lépjen kapcsolatba velünk a jelen Adatvédelmi nyilatkozat végén megadott elérhetőségeken keresztül, vagy kövesse az adott program feltételeiben meghatározott utasításokat.
* **Álláspályázatok**. Álláspályázata vagy hasonló megkeresése kapcsán is személyes adatokat adhat át nekünk, ilyen például az önéletrajza, a szakmai referenciái, a végzettségével és a szakmai hátterével, valamint a szakmai képzettségével és bizonyítványaival kapcsolatos információk. Mi és vállalatcsoportunk tagjai felhasználhatjuk ezeket az adatokat az állás betöltéséhez, a háttérellenőrzések elvégzéséhez és a munkavállalásra való alkalmasság ellenőrzéséhez, valamint a jelentkezése kapcsán rendelkezésre bocsátott külön adatvédelmi nyilatkozatban vagy más tájékoztatóban foglalt további célokra. Bizonyos esetben harmadik feleket (például állásközvetítő céget) vagy közösségimédia-platformokat is igénybe vehetünk az álláspályázatok bekéréséhez, összegyűjtéséhez és megőrzéséhez. További információkért olvassa el az [állásra jelentkezőkre vonatkozó adatvédelmi nyilatkozatunka](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/applicant-privacy-notice#hungarian)t.
* **Kutatás és elemzések**. Személyes adatait felhasználhatjuk különböző kutatások és elemzések elvégzésére, amelyek célja a vásárlási preferenciák vizsgálata, az Ön igényeinek leginkább megfelelő termékek és szolgáltatások megkeresése, valamint az Önnek megjelenített hirdetések hatékonyságának felmérése.
* **Végrehajtás**: Az Önről gyűjtött személyes adatokat felhasználhatjuk a csalások, a szerzői jogsértések, a törvénysértések, a felhasználási feltételeink megsértésének, valamint a Webhelyeink egyéb helytelen használatának észlelésére, megelőzésére és kezelésére.

Ha a jogszabályok megengedik, a Webhelyeinken gyűjtött információkat az Önről tárolt egyéb adatokkal (például a termékek és szolgáltatások használatával kapcsolatos adatokkal) kombinálva felhasználhatjuk a jelen Adatvédelmi nyilatkozatban meghatározott célokra és arra, hogy jobb és egységesebb ügyfélélményt biztosítsunk Önnek a velünk folytatott interakciók során.

**Az adatkezelés jogalapja**

Ha a jogszabályok előírják, gondoskodunk arról, hogy személyes adatai feldolgozásának megfelelő jogalapja legyen. A legtöbb esetben a hivatkozott jogalap az érintett személyes adatoktól és ezek begyűjtésének konkrét körülményeitől függ.

* **Szerződés**: az adatkezelés az általunk Önnek nyújtott szolgáltatások biztosításához szükséges, vagy ahhoz, hogy (az Ön kérésére) megtegyük az ilyen szolgáltatások teljesítését megelőzően szükséges lépéseket;
* **Jogi kötelezettség**: az adatok kezelésére jogi kötelezettségeinknek, többek között a hatályos törvényeknek, jogszabályoknak, kormányzati és ezzel egyenértékű kérelmeknek, bírósági rendeleteknek vagy idézéseknek való megfelelés érdekében van szükség;
* **Hozzájárulás**: az adatkezelés alapja, hogy Ön hozzájárult személyes adatai egy vagy több célra (például marketingcélokra) való kezeléséhez;
* **Jogos érdek**: az adatkezelésre jogos érdekből, például Webhelyeink, termékeink és/vagy szolgáltatásaink ügyfeleink érdekében történő fejlesztéséhez és javításához van szükség; vagy
* **Létfontosságú érdek**: az adatkezelés az Ön létfontosságú érdekeinek védelméhez szükséges (például egészségügyi és biztonsági okokból, ha Ön a Honeywell egyik telephelyén vesz részt egy megbeszélésen).

Ha bármilyen kérdése van, vagy további információra van szüksége a személyes adatok gyűjtésének és felhasználásának jogalapjáról, írjon nekünk a következő e-mail-címre: [HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com)

**Az adatok névtelenítése**

A hatályos jogszabályoknak megfelelően bizonyos esetekben anonimizáljuk személyes adatait, amelyek ezt követően nem lesznek alkalmasak az Ön azonosítására. A névtelenített adatok nem számítanak személyes adatoknak, azért ezekre a jelen Adatvédelmi nyilatkozat nem vonatkozik. Névtelen adatokat bármilyen célból gyűjthetünk, felhasználhatunk, összesíthetünk és megoszthatunk.

**Az adatok megőrzésének időtartama**

A személyes adatok megőrzésének időtartama a feldolgozás céljától függően eltérő lehet. Például az Ön által kért termékek és szolgáltatások biztosításához vagy a tranzakciók teljesítéséhez szükséges személyes adatokat mindaddig megőrizzük, amíg Ön a Honeywell ügyfele. Továbbá ha Ön a Webhelyeinken keresztül állásra jelentkezik nálunk, a jelentkezés kapcsán átadott adatvédelmi tájékoztatóban vagy a jogszabályokban előírtaknak megfelelően őrizzük meg a jelentkezéséhez kapcsolódó adatokat. A személyes adatokat minden más esetben a jelen Adatvédelmi nyilatkozatban meghatározott célok teljesítéséhez szükséges ideig őrizzük meg, amelyet követően az adatokat névtelenítjük (ha a hatályos jogszabályok ezt lehetővé teszik), töröljük vagy megsemmisítjük.

**Az adatok továbbítása**

A hatályos törvényeknek megfelelően személyes adatait bizonyos harmadik felekkel is megoszthatjuk. Ezeket a harmadik feleket az alábbiakban ismertetjük:

* **Vállalatcsoportunkhoz tartozó társaságok**. Személyes adatait a jelen Adatvédelmi nyilatkozatban meghatározott célokhoz szükséges mértékben megoszthatjuk társvállalatainkkal és a csoporthoz tartozó vállalatokkal.
* **Szolgáltatók**. Személyes adatait megoszthatjuk a megbízásunkból szerződéses alapon különböző szolgáltatásokat nyújtó vállalatokkal, amelyek például webhelyeinket üzemeltetik, felméréseket végeznek, tranzakciókat dolgoznak fel, elemzéseket végeznek Webhelyeinken, valamint üzleti tevékenységünk, Webhelyeink, termékeink és szolgáltatásaink minőségének javítását célzó elemzéseket végeznek. E szolgáltatók számára előírjuk, hogy minden esetben bizalmasan kezeljék az Ön személyes adatait.
* **Forgalmazók és más megbízható üzleti partnerek**. Személyes adatait megoszthatjuk a termékeinket forgalmazó harmadik felekkel és más megbízható üzleti partnerekkel, és többek között engedélyezhetjük az ilyen harmadik feleknek, hogy marketinganyagokat küldjenek Önnek. A személyes adatok marketingcélokból történő megosztása során mindig a hatályos törvényeknek és jogszabályoknak megfelelően járunk el.
* **Tranzakciókkal kapcsolatos adattovábbítás**. Bizonyos tranzakciók során pénzügyi intézményekkel, kormányzati szervekkel, valamint a tranzakciók végrehajtásában érintett szállítmányozási vállalatokkal és postai szolgáltatókkal is megoszthatjuk az Ön egyes személyes adatait vagy valamennyi személyes adatát.
* **Felvásárlással vagy vállalatrész eladásával kapcsolatos adattovábbítás**. Előfordulhat, hogy a Honeywell stratégiai vagy üzleti célokból úgy dönt, hogy bizonyos országokban elad, megvásárol, leválaszt, egybeolvaszt vagy más módon átszervez egyes alvállalatokat. Ebben az esetben a Honeywell-vállalat eszközeinek egy részének vagy egészének egybeeolvasztásával, felvásárlásával, leválasztásával vagy eladásával járó tevékenységekkel kapcsolatos tárgyalások lebonyolításához, valamint az ilyen tevékenységek elvégzéséhez szükséges mértékben megoszthatjuk az Önről tárolt adatokat.
* **Adattovábbítás más okból**. Személyes adatait abban az esetben is továbbíthatjuk, ha ezt a törvények előírják vagy lehetővé teszik, valamint ha jóhiszeműen úgy véljük, hogy az adatok továbbítására törvényi kötelezettségeknek vagy jogi eljárásban született döntésnek való megfelelés, jogaink vagy vagyonunk védelme, valamint sürgős esetekben egy személy biztonságának védelme érdekében van szükség.

**Nemzetközi adattovábbítás**

A Honeywell globális vállalat, ezért az Ön személyes adatait a hatályos jogszabályoknak megfelelően világszerte különböző helyszínekre, például az Amerikai Egyesült Államokba, Mexikóba és Indiába továbbíthatjuk, így az Ön adatait ezekben az országokban is tárolhatjuk és felhasználhatjuk. Tehát az Öntől gyűjtött személyes adatokat olyan országokban is kezelhetjük, amelyek adatvédelmi jogszabályai eltérhetnek az Ön országában hatályos törvényektől. A Honeywell minden észszerűen elvárható lépést megtesz az Ön magánéletének és személyes adatainak megóvása érdekében, valamint hogy az Ön lakóhelye szerinti országhoz hasonló szintű védelmet biztosítson adatainak. Ennek részeként az Európai Bizottság által jóváhagyott általános szerződési feltételeket is alkalmazunk. A személyes adatok védelmét szolgáló intézkedésekkel kapcsolatos további tájékoztatásért írjon nekünk a [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com) e-mail-címre.

**Biztonság**

Elkötelezettek vagyunk személyes adatai védelme mellett. Technikai és szervezési intézkedéseket vezettünk be annak érdekében, hogy az adatkezelésben rejlő kockázatokhoz mérten megfelelő szintű biztonságot érjünk el. Ha szeretne többet megtudni arról, hogyan védi a Honeywell az Ön személyes adatait, írjon nekünk a [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com) e-mail-címre.

**Az Ön jogai**

A hatályos jogszabályoktól függően Önt bizonyos jogok illethetik meg személyes adataival kapcsolatban.

* Például jogosult lehet arra, hogy **hozzáférjen személyes adataihoz, valamint helyesbítse és frissítse őket**, vagy kérelmezze a **törlésüket**.
* Emellett **tiltakozhat** személyes adatainak feldolgozása ellen, kérheti, hogy **korlátozzuk** személyes adatainak feldolgozását, valamint az adatok **hordozhatóságával** kapcsolatos kérelmet is küldhet nekünk.
* Emellett joga lehet ahhoz, **hogy ne hozzanak Önről kizárólag automatizált adatkezelésen, például profilalkotáson alapuló döntést,** ha ez a döntés joghatással bír Önre, vagy jelentős mértékben érinti Önt.
* Emellett ha személyes adatait az Ön hozzájárulása alapján gyűjtöttük össze és kezeljük, akkor **Ön bármikor visszavonhatja a hozzájárulását**. A hozzájárulás visszavonása nem érinti a korábban végzett adatkezelés jogszerűségét, valamint nem befolyásolja azokat az adatkezelési tevékenységeket, amelyeket nem az Ön hozzájárulása alapján, hanem más jogalappal végzünk.
* Jogában áll úgy dönteni, hogy **nem engedélyezi személyes adatainak értékesítését**. A Honeywell nem értékesíti az Ön személyes adatait harmadik feleknek nyereség céljából Az Ön személyes adatait azonban bizonyos, a jelen Adatvédelmi nyilatkozatban és a [Cookie-kkal kapcsolatos közleményben](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/cookie-notice#hungarian) megadott esetekben megoszthatjuk harmadik felekkel, valamint harmadik feleknek továbbíthatjuk. Például harmadik felekkel együttműködve forgalmazzuk a termékeinket, műszaki segítséget nyújtunk Önnek, webhelyelemző eszközöket és funkciókat használunk, valamint különböző módszerekkel népszerűsítjük és értékesítjük termékeinket és szolgáltatásainkat. E tevékenységek során előfordulhat, hogy harmadik feleknek kell továbbítanunk az Ön személyes adatait, és egyes adatvédelmi törvények értelmében ez az adatok „értékesítésének” minősülhet.
* Önnek joga van **panaszt tenni** a joghatóságában hatályos adatvédelmi törvények betartásának felügyeletéért felelős adatvédelmi hatóságnál személyes adatainak gyűjtésével és felhasználásával kapcsolatban, ha úgy véli, hogy az adatkezelés során nem tartottuk be az adatvédelmi jogszabályokat. Az EGT területén élő magánszemélyek például panaszt tehetnek az illetékes adatvédelmi hatóságnál. E hatóságok listája a következő címen érhető el: [https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members\_en](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en). Nagyra értékelnénk azonban, ha lehetőséget adna nekünk, hogy mi foglalkozzunk az aggályaival. Ha panasza merül fel, vegye fel velünk bátran a kapcsolatot! Nem alkalmazunk hátrányos megkülönböztetést az adatvédelmi jogaikat gyakorló magánszemélyekkel szemben.

Minden esetben lehetővé tesszük, hogy Ön élhessen a hatályos törvények értelmében fennálló jogaival. Bizonyos esetekben még akkor is megpróbálunk eleget tenni az Ön adatkezelési tevékenységeinkkel kapcsolatos kéréséinek, ha az Ön személyes adatait nem védik az adatvédelmi törvények, vagy nem tartoznak az adatvédelmi törvények hatálya alá. Ha kérdése merül fel a jogaival kapcsolatban, vagy szeretné gyakorolni a jogait, írjon nekünk a [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com) e-mail-címre, vagy küldje el adatvédelemmel kapcsolatos kérdéseit az alábbi hivatkozáson elérhető interaktív webes űrlapon keresztül:

**Gyermekek adatai**

Webhelyeink nem tizenhat (16) éven aluli gyermekek számára készültek, és tudatosan nem gyűjtünk és nem is használunk fel adatokat ilyen személyekről, és nem értékesítjük ilyen személyek adatait. Ha Ön az országa törvényei szerint kiskorúnak minősül, ne adjon meg személyes adatokat a Webhelyeinken keresztül.

**Más webhelyekre mutató hivatkozások**

Webhelyeink harmadik felek webhelyeire, termékeire és szolgáltatásaira mutató hivatkozásokat tartalmazhatnak. Az ilyen webhelyekért, termékekért és szolgáltatásokért, valamint az általuk végzett adatgyűjtésért és -kezelésért nem vállalunk felelősséget. Az ilyen harmadik felek gyakorlatait saját adatvédelmi szabályzataik határozzák meg. Javasoljuk, hogy tájékozódjon e harmadik felek adatvédelmi gyakorlatairól.

Possiamo inoltre acquisire informazioni di contatto aziendali dal datore di lavoro o da altre terze parti per favorire o altrimenti intraprendere attività commerciali tradizionali e questioni amministrative di tipo analogo.

**Utilizzo delle informazioni**

Le informazioni personali acquisite da Honeywell attraverso i nostri siti o quando l'utente ci contatta possono essere utilizzate per i seguenti scopi:

* **Dati di contatto aziendali**. Honeywell acquisisce e utilizza i dati di contatto aziendali per effettuare comunicazioni o transazioni, anche per condurre attività di due diligence, o fornire o ricevere, un prodotto o un servizio. Per esempio, Honeywell può acquisire e utilizzare questi dati di contatto aziendali per agevolare e gestire ordini, contratti, garanzie, interventi di manutenzione e funzioni aziendali analoghe, per finalità di analisi e riscossione dei crediti, per contribuire alla nostra conformità interna e soddisfare i requisiti legali e (se necessario) per difendere i nostri interessi e diritti.
* **Servizi e transazioni**. Ci riserviamo il diritto di utilizzare le informazioni personali per offrire servizi o effettuare transazioni richieste dall'utente, come per esempio la fornitura di informazioni su prodotti e servizi Honeywell acquistati o altrimenti utilizzati dall'utente, la registrazione dei prodotti acquistati, il monitoraggio degli ordini di prodotti, la gestione delle richieste di garanzia, la sostituzione di manuali dei prodotti, le risposte alle richieste effettuate al servizio clienti, l'assistenza nell'utilizzo dei nostri siti web e così via.
* **Amministrazione e tutela della nostra attività e dei nostri siti**.

* **Marketing**. In accordo con le leggi e le normative applicabili, ci riserviamo il diritto di utilizzare i dati personali dell'utente per informarlo di prodotti o servizi a cui l'utente potrebbe essere interessato e per comunicazioni di altro genere in relazione a promozioni, eventi e novità, sondaggi, offerte speciali e temi correlati. L'utente ha il diritto di revocare il consenso alla ricezione di comunicazioni di marketing via e-mail in qualsiasi momento, gratuitamente, mediante il link "annulla iscrizione" presente in tutte le e-mail contenenti materiale di marketing ricevute da Honeywell o contattandoci attraverso le informazioni di contatto contenute nella presente Informativa sulla privacy. In base al paese di residenza, l'utente può scegliere di annullare la ricezione anche di altri tipi di comunicazioni di marketing; per ulteriori informazioni, è possibile contattarci utilizzando le informazioni riportate nella presente Informativa sulla privacy. Alcune giurisdizioni forniscono ai singoli (per esempio, i residenti in California) il diritto di richiedere specifiche informazioni riguardanti la nostra divulgazione di dati personali a terzi per scopi di marketing diretto degli stessi. Per ricevere maggiori informazioni sulle nostre pratiche di divulgazione dei dati per scopi di marketing, è possibile contattarci secondo le istruzioni elencate di seguito.
* **Pubblicità basata sugli interessi dell'utente**.

* **Programmi di incentivazione finanziaria e di fidelizzazione**. Acquisiamo e utilizziamo i dati personali per mantenere e amministrare i nostri programmi di incentivazione finanziaria e di fidelizzazione. Utilizziamo i dati personali comunicati dall'utente in questi programmi per offrire premi unici, monitorare lo stato del programma e agevolare lo scambio di punti del programma per prodotti, materiali promozionali, laboratori di formazione e altri articoli. Nei limiti consentiti dalla legge, possiamo anche utilizzare qualsiasi dato personale da voi fornito nel contesto di un programma di incentivi finanziari per qualsiasi altro scopo indicato nella presente Informativa sulla privacy. Si raccomanda di esaminare i termini e le condizioni di ciascun programma di incentivi finanziari a cui si desidera registrarsi o partecipare, in quanto tali termini e condizioni possono essere strettamente adattati al programma specifico. Qualora l'utente dia il proprio consenso a partecipare a tali programmi, può revocare tale consenso in qualsiasi momento contattandoci attraverso i dettagli di contatto riportati in calce alla presente Informativa sulla privacy o in conformità con le istruzioni stabilite nei termini e nelle condizioni del programma specifico.

Noi e i membri del nostro gruppo possiamo utilizzare tali informazioni allo scopo di prendere in considerazione la possibilità di assunzione, verificarne la veridicità e l'idoneità per l'impiego specifico, e come altrimenti indicato in qualsiasi dichiarazione separata sulla privacy o altro avviso reso disponibile in relazione alla candidatura dell'utente. È possibile utilizzare una terza parte (ad esempio, Recruiter di processo) o la piattaforma dei social media per sollecitare, raccogliere e conservare le domande d'impiego.

**Fondamento giuridico alla base del trattamento dei dati**

Ove previsto dalla legge, garantiremo all'utente una base giuridica per il trattamento dei dati personali. Nella maggior parte dei casi la nostra base giuridica dipenderà dai dati personali trattati e dal contesto specifico di acquisizione.

In caso di domande o necessità di ulteriori informazioni sulla base giuridica su cui raccogliamo e utilizziamo i dati personali, inviate un'e-mail all'indirizzo [HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com)

**Trasformazione in forma anonima dei dati**

Conformemente alla legislazione applicabile, siamo autorizzati a rendere anonimi i dati personali dell'utente affinché non possano più essere utilizzati per identificarlo. I dati resi anonimi non si classificano più come dati personali, pertanto non sono soggetti alla presente Informativa sulla privacy. Ci riserviamo il diritto di acquisire, utilizzare, aggregare e condividere dati in forma anonima per qualsiasi scopo.

**Durata della conservazione dei dati**

Il periodo durante il quale i dati personali dell'utente vengono conservati varia in base allo scopo per cui vengono trattati. Per esempio, conserviamo i dati personali necessari per fornire prodotti e servizi, o per agevolare le transazioni richieste, per tutto il tempo in cui l'utente è cliente di Honeywell o se presenta una domanda di assunzione tramite i nostri siti, conserviamo i dettagli della sua domanda come indicato nell'informativa sulla privacy messa a disposizione dell'utente in relazione alla sua candidatura o come altrimenti previsto a norma di legge. In tutti gli altri casi, Honeywell conserva i dati personali dell'utente per il tempo necessario ad adempiere alle finalità descritte nella presente Informativa sulla privacy. Al termine di tale periodo, i dati saranno resi anonimi (ove consentito dalla legislazione applicabile), eliminati o distrutti.

**Divulgazione dei dati**

Conformemente alla legislazione applicabile, siamo autorizzati a condividere i dati personali dell'utente con terzi selezionati, incluso quanto riportato di seguito:

* **Società del gruppo**. Siamo, inoltre, autorizzati a condividere i dati personali dell'utente con le nostre affiliate e con le società del gruppo Honeywell per le finalità descritte nella presente Informativa sulla privacy.
* **Fornitori di servizi**. Siamo autorizzati a condividere i dati personali dell'utente con le aziende che forniscono servizi per nostro conto, quali hosting di siti web, conduzione di sondaggi, elaborazione delle transazioni, analisi dei nostri siti e conduzione di analisi per migliorare la qualità dell'attività aziendale, dei nostri siti e dei prodotti e servizi offerti. Honeywell richiede a tali fornitori di servizi di tutelare la confidenzialità dei dati personali dell'utente.
* **Distributori e altri partner commerciali di fiducia**. Siamo autorizzati a condividere i dati personali dell'utente con i terzi incaricati della distribuzione dei nostri prodotti e con altri partner commerciali di fiducia per finalità che includono l'invio, da parte di tali terzi, di comunicazioni di marketing all'utente. Tale condivisione dei dati personali dell'utente per scopi di marketing verrà realizzata in conformità alle leggi e alle normative applicabili.
* **Divulgazione correlata alle transazioni**. In relazione a determinate transazioni, possiamo divulgare in parte o interamente i dati personali dell'utente a istituzioni finanziarie, enti governativi e società di spedizione o servizi postali coinvolti nell'adempimento della transazione.
* **Divulgazione in relazione ad acquisizioni o cessioni**. Possono verificarsi circostanze in cui, per ragioni strategiche o per altre ragioni commerciali, Honeywell decide di vendere, acquistare, cedere, fondere o riorganizzare diversamente le attività in alcuni paesi. Honeywell può divulgare i dati dell'utente che essa conserva nella misura necessaria e opportuna a continuare la trattativa o a completare una fusione, un'acquisizione, una cessione o una vendita di tutte le attività di Honeywell o di una loro parte.
* **Divulgazione per altre ragioni**. Ci riserviamo il diritto di divulgare dati personali se richiesto o consentito dalla legge o in caso di buona fede che tale procedura sia necessaria per rispondere a obblighi o procedure di legge, per proteggere e difendere i nostri diritti o proprietà o, in casi urgenti, per difendere la sicurezza personale di un individuo.

**Trasferimenti internazionali**

Honeywell è un'organizzazione globale e i dati personali degli utenti possono essere trasferiti, conservati, memorizzati o utilizzati in varie località del mondo, come gli Stati Uniti, il Messico e l'India, in conformità alle leggi vigenti. Ciò significa che, quando raccogliamo i vostri dati personali, questi possono essere trattati in paesi che possono avere leggi sulla protezione dei dati diverse da quelle del vostro paese. Tuttavia, Honeywell adotterà sempre le misure necessarie per tutelare la tua privacy e per fornire un livello di protezione dei dati personali paragonabile a quello del tuo paese di residenza, il che include l'attuazione delle clausole contrattuali tipo della Commissione europea. Per maggiori informazioni sulle misure di sicurezza appropriate in atto a protezione dei dati personali, contattateci all'indirizzo [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com).

**Sicurezza**

Abbiamo come priorità la tutela della sicurezza dei dati personali. Utilizziamo misure tecniche e organizzative per fornire un livello di sicurezza adeguato al rischio di trattamento dei dati personali. Per maggiori informazioni sulle modalità adottate da Honeywell a tutela dei dati personali, contattateci all'indirizzo [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com)

**Diritti dell'utente**

A seconda della legge applicabile, l'utente può esercitare alcuni diritti in relazione ai propri dati personali.

* Può avere il diritto di **accedere, correggere, aggiornare** o **richiedere la cancellazione** dei propri dati personali.
* Può **opporsi** al trattamento dei propri dati personali, chiederci di **limitare** il trattamento dei propri dati personali o richiederne la **portabilità**.
* Ha il diritto **di non accettare che sia presa una decisione su di lui basata esclusivamente sull'elaborazione automatizzata, compresa la profilazione,** se tale decisione produce effetti giuridici sulla sua persona o la colpisce in modo significativo.
* Allo stesso modo, se abbiamo raccolto ed elaborato i dati personali con il suo consenso, l'utente può **ritirare il proprio consenso in qualsiasi momento**. La revoca del consenso non influirà sulla liceità di qualsiasi trattamento eseguito prima della revoca, né influenzerà il trattamento dei dati personali condotto facendo affidamento su criteri di liceità del trattamento diversi dal consenso.
* L'utente ha il diritto di **opporsi alla vendita dei propri dati personal**i. Honeywell si impegna a non vendere a terzi i dati personali degli utenti a scopo di lucro. Tuttavia, condividiamo o divulghiamo in altro modo i dati personali degli utenti a terze parti in conformità con la presente Informativa sulla privacy e la nostra [Informativa sui cookie](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/cookie-notice#italian). Per esempio, ci avvaliamo di società terze per distribuire i nostri prodotti, fornire assistenza tecnica, gestire strumenti e funzioni di analisi del sito web e svolgere attività di marketing e vendita dei nostri prodotti e servizi. Tali attività possono comportare la divulgazione dei dati personali a terzi e possono essere considerate una "vendita" di dati secondo alcune (ma non tutte) le leggi in materia di tutela dei dati.
* L'utente ha il diritto di **presentare reclamo** all'autorità preposta alla tutela dei dati personali, responsabile del controllo del rispetto della legge sulla sicurezza dei dati nella propria giurisdizione, in merito alla nostra acquisizione e all'utilizzo dei propri dati personali, qualora ritenga che il trattamento dei dati personali non sia conforme alla legge sulla loro tutela. Per esempio, gli individui residenti nel SEE hanno il diritto di presentare reclamo all'autorità competente per la protezione dei dati; l'elenco è consultabile all'indirizzo: [https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members\_en](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en). Tuttavia saremmo lieti di avere la possibilità di risolvere direttamente eventuali dubbi, pertanto invitiamo gli utenti a contattarci in relazione a qualsiasi motivo di insoddisfazione. Non opereremo alcuna discriminazione nei confronti degli individui che esercitano i loro diritti in materia di privacy.

Contribuiremo ad agevolare l'esercizio dei diritti dell'utente in conformità con la legge vigente. Tuttavia, anche se i vostri dati personali non sono protetti da una legge sulla tutela dei dati, o altrimenti soggetti a tale legge, possiamo cercare di soddisfare qualsiasi richiesta o istanza che possiate avanzare in merito alle nostre attività di trattamento dei dati. Per domande sui propri diritti o per esercitare i propri diritti, è possibile contattarci all'indirizzo [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com) o inviare domande sulla privacy tramite il nostro modulo web interattivo disponibile al seguente link:

    * **Bruksdata,** inkludert informasjon om hvordan du bruker våre nettsteder, hvilke sider du viser, antall byte som overføres, lenkene du klikker på, materialene du har tilgang til, datoen og klokkeslettet du får tilgang til nettstedet, nettstedet som du koblet videre til et av våre nettsteder fra, og andre handlinger på nettstedet; og
    * **Tekniske data,** for eksempel din IP-adresse, nettlesertype og -funksjoner og språk og operativsystem.

For informasjon om informasjonskapslene og andre lignende sporingsteknologier vi bruker på nettstedene våre, kan du se vår [merknad om informasjonskapsler](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/cookie-notice#norwegian).

* **Geolokasjonsinformasjon**. For bestemte nettsteder kan vi med uttrykkelig samtykke fra deg samle inn nøyaktige posisjonsopplysninger i sanntid (dvs. geolokasjon) for mobilenheten din. Denne informasjonen brukes bare for å lette din bruk av nettstedene, inkludert av tjenesteleverandørene våre som kan behandle denne informasjonen i forbindelse med å tilby tjenester på våre vegne. Hvis du har gitt det, kan du justere dette samtykket ved å administrere preferansene dine for posisjonstjenester gjennom innstillingene på mobilenheten din.
* **Informasjon samlet inn fra tredjeparter**. I samsvar med gjeldende lov kan vi samle inn personopplysninger om deg fra tredjeparter, for eksempel nettsteder og apper på sosiale medier, og kombinere dem med informasjon vi allerede har, for å hjelpe oss med å forbedre og tilpasse nettstedene dine etter dine preferanser og for andre formål som er angitt i denne personvernerklæringen. Vi kan også samle virksomhetens kontaktinformasjon fra arbeidsgiveren din eller andre tredjeparter for å legge til rette for eller på annen måte delta i tradisjonelle forretningsaktiviteter og lignende administrative spørsmål.

**Vår bruk av opplysninger**

Vi kan bruke den personlige informasjonen som er samlet inn via våre nettsteder, eller når du kontakter oss for formål som inkluderer:

* **Forretningskontaktdata**. Honeywell samler inn og bruker forretningskontaktdata for å delta i kommunikasjon eller transaksjoner, inkludert for å utføre due diligence om, eller levere eller motta, et produkt eller en tjeneste. For eksempel kan Honeywell samle inn og bruke disse forretningskontaktopplysningene for å tilrettelegge for og administrere bestillinger, kontrakter, garantier, vedlikehold og lignende forretningsfunksjoner, for kredittanalyse- og innkrevingsformål, for å bistå med vårt eget interne samsvar og juridiske krav, og (om nødvendig) for å forsvare våre interesser og krav.
* **Tjenester og transaksjoner**. Vi kan bruke personopplysningene dine til å levere deg tjenester og utføre transaksjoner du har bedt om, inklusiv, men ikke begrenset til, å gi informasjon om selskapets produkter, eller tjenester som du har kjøpt eller på annen måte bruker, registrere kjøpte produkter, behandle produktbestillinger, behandle garantikrav, erstatte produkthåndbøker, svare på kundeservicehenvendelser og forenkle bruken av nettstedene våre.
* **Administrere og beskytte vår virksomhet og nettsteder**. Vi kan bruke dine personlige opplysninger til å administrere og beskytte vår virksomhet og våre nettsteder, inkludert feilsøking, systemvedlikehold, brukerstøtte, rapportering og hosting av data.
* **Forbedre vår forretningsvirksomhet, nettsteder, produkter og tjenester**. Vi kan bruke dine personlige opplysninger til å utføre forretningsanalyser eller til andre formål som hjelper oss med å utvikle og forbedre kvaliteten på virksomheten vår, nettsteder, produkter og tjenester (inkludert nye produkter og tjenester), for eksempel ved å tilpasse våre nettsteder til dine spesielle preferanser eller interesser.
* **Markedsføring**. I samsvar med gjeldende lover og forskrifter kan vi bruke dine personopplysninger til å informere deg om produkter eller tjenester som kan være av interesse for deg, og ellers kommunisere med deg om tilbud, hendelser og nyheter, undersøkelser, spesialtilbud og relaterte emner. Du kan når som helst melde deg fra markedsføringskommunikasjon sendt via e-post, gratis ved å bruke "unsubscribe"-lenken i e-postmarkedsføringsmateriell du mottar fra oss, eller ved å kontakte oss ved å bruke kontaktopplysningene som er oppført i denne personvernerklæringen. Avhengig av bostedsland kan du også velge bort andre typer markedsføringskommunikasjon; kontakt oss ved hjelp av kontaktinformasjonen som er oppført i personvernerklæringen for mer informasjon. Noen jurisdiksjoner gir enkeltpersoner (for eksempel innbyggere i California) rett til å be om bestemt informasjon om vår utlevering av personopplysninger til tredjeparter for tredjepartens direkte markedsføringsformål. For mer informasjon om vår datapubliseringspraksis for markedsføringsformål kan du kontakte oss i samsvar med instruksjonene som er oppført nedenfor.
* **Interessebasert reklame**. Vi samler inn data om aktivitetene dine på nettet og identifiserer interessene dine slik at vi kan tilby reklame som er mest relevant for deg. Du kan velge å motta interessebasert reklame fra Honeywell som beskrevet i vår [merknad om informasjonskapsler](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/cookie-notice#norwegian).
* **Programmer for økonomisk insentiv og lojalitet**. Vi samler inn og bruker personopplysninger for å opprettholde og administrere våre programmer for økonomisk insentiv og lojalitet. Vi bruker personopplysningene du oppgir i disse programmene for å tilby unike belønninger, spore programstatusen din og for å tilrettelegge for utvekslingen av programpoeng i produkter, reklamemateriell, treningsverksteder og andre ting. I den grad loven tillater det, kan vi også bruke alle personopplysninger som du oppgir i forbindelse med et økonomisk insentivprogram til ethvert annet formål som er angitt i denne personvernerklæringen. Se gjennom vilkårene og betingelsene for hvert økonomisk insentivprogram du ønsker å registrere deg for eller delta i, ettersom slike vilkår kan være smalt tilpasset det aktuelle programmet. Hvis du samtykker i å delta i disse programmene, kan du når som helst trekke tilbake samtykket ved å kontakte oss ved å bruke kontaktinformasjonen på slutten av denne personvernerklæringen eller i samsvar med instruksjonene i det aktuelle programmets vilkår og betingelser.
* **Jobbsøknader**. I forbindelse med en jobbsøknad eller henvendelse kan du gi oss informasjon om deg selv, for eksempel CV, fagreferanser, informasjon om utdanning og jobbbakgrunn, og informasjon om fagopplæring og sertifiseringer. Vi og medlemmer av vår gruppe kan bruke denne informasjonen for å vurdere ansettelser, bakgrunnskontroll og ansettelseskvalifikasjon, og som det ellers er angitt i en hvilken som helst separat personvernerklæring eller annen merknad som er gjort tilgjengelig i forbindelse med søknaden din. Vi kan bruke en tredjepart (f.eks. rekrutteringsbyrå) eller plattform for sosiale medier for å be om, samle inn og beholde jobbsøknader. For mer informasjon kan du lese vår [Personvernerklæring for søkere](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/applicant-privacy-notice#norwegian).
* **Undersøkelser og analyser**. Vi kan bruke dine personopplysninger til å utføre forskning og analyse for å hjelpe oss med å analysere innkjøpspraksis, identifisere produktene og tjenestene som best passer dine krav, og måle effektiviteten av annonseringen vi leverer til deg.
* **Håndhevelse**: Vi kan bruke personopplysningene vi samler for å oppdage, forhindre og håndtere svindel, brudd på immaterielle rettigheter, brudd på våre vilkår og betingelser, lovbrudd eller annen misbruk av våre nettsteder.

Når loven tillater det, kan vi kombinere informasjonen vi samler inn via våre nettsteder med annen informasjon vi har om deg (for eksempel informasjon om din bruk av våre produkter og tjenester) for å tilby deg en bedre og konsistent kundeopplevelse når du samhandler med oss eller andre formål som er angitt i denne personvernerklæringen.

**Det rettslige grunnlaget for å behandle opplysninger**

Når loven krever det, sørger vi for at det er et rettslig grunnlag for behandlingen av dine personlige opplysninger. I de fleste tilfeller avhenger vårt juridiske grunnlag av de aktuelle personopplysningene og den spesifikke konteksten vi samler dem inn i.

* **Kontrakt**: behandlingen er nødvendig for utførelsen av tjenestene vi tilbyr deg, eller for å ta skritt (på din forespørsel) før utførelse av slike tjenester;
* **Juridisk forpliktelse**: behandlingen er nødvendig for å overholde våre juridiske forpliktelser, herunder overholdelse av gjeldende lover, forskrifter, statlige og kvasi-statlige forespørsler, rettsordre eller stevninger;
* **Samtykke**: behandlingen er basert på ditt samtykke til behandling av din personopplysninger for ett eller flere spesifiserte formål (for eksempel markedsføring);
* **Legitime interesser**: behandlingen er nødvendig for å møte våre legitime interesser, for eksempel for å utvikle og forbedre våre nettsteder, produkter og/eller tjenester til fordel for våre kunder; eller
* **Vitale interesser**: behandlingen er nødvendig for å beskytte dine vitale interesser (for eksempel helse- og sikkerhetsmessige grunner hvis du deltar på et møte på et Honeywell-sted).

Hvis du har spørsmål om eller trenger ytterligere informasjon om det juridiske grunnlaget som vi samler inn og bruker din personlige informasjon på, kan du sende en e-post til [HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com)

**Anonymisering av opplysninger**

I samsvar med gjeldende lov kan vi anonymisere dine personopplysninger slik at de ikke lenger kan brukes til å identifisere deg. Anonymisert informasjon anses ikke som personopplysninger og er derfor ikke underlagt denne personvernerklæringen. Vi kan samle inn, bruke, aggregere og dele anonymisert informasjon til ethvert formål.

**Hvor lenge vi lagrer opplysninger**

Perioden vi lagrer dine personopplysninger varierer avhengig av formålet med behandlingen. For eksempel lagrer vi personopplysninger som er nødvendige for å levere produkter og tjenester til deg, eller for å tilrettelegge for transaksjoner du har bedt om, så lenge du er kunde hos Honeywell, eller hvis du sender inn en jobbsøknad via våre nettsteder, vil vi beholde informasjon om søknaden din som beskrevet i personvernerklæringen som er tilgjengelig for deg i forbindelse med søknaden din eller som ellers kreves av loven. I alle andre tilfeller lagrer vi dine personlige opplysninger så lenge det er nødvendig for å oppfylle formålene som er angitt i denne personvernerklæringen, etter hvilken tid det er enten anonymisert (der det er tillatt ved gjeldende lov), slettet eller ødelagt.

**Utlevering av opplysninger**

Vi kan dele dine personopplysninger med utvalgte tredjeparter i samsvar med gjeldende lov, inkludert som angitt nedenfor:

* **Våre konsernselskaper**. Vi kan dele dine personopplysninger med våre tilknyttede selskaper og konsernselskaper som rimelig nødvendig for de formålene som er angitt i denne personvernerklæringen.
* **Tjenesteleverandører**. Vi kan dele dine personopplysninger med selskaper som vi har utkontraktert til å tilby tjenester på våre vegne, for eksempel hosting av nettsteder, gjennomføring av undersøkelser, behandlingstransaksjoner, analyse av våre nettsteder og utførelse av analyser for å forbedre kvaliteten på vår virksomhet, nettsteder, produkter og tjenester. Vi trenger disse tjenesteleverandørene for å beskytte konfidensialiteten til dine personopplysninger.
* **Distributører og andre pålitelige samarbeidspartnere**. Vi kan dele dine personlige opplysninger med tredjeparter som distribuerer våre produkter og andre pålitelige forretningspartnere til formål som inkluderer at disse tredjepartene kan sende markedsføringskommunikasjon til deg. Slik utveksling av personlig informasjon til markedsføringsformål blir utført i samsvar med gjeldende lover og forskrifter.
* **Utlevering i forbindelse med transaksjoner**. I forbindelse med visse transaksjoner kan det hende vi leverer videre noen av eller alle personopplysningene dine til finansinstitusjoner, myndighetsorganer og transport- eller postselskaper som er involvert i utførelsen av transaksjonen.
* **Opplysninger i forbindelse med oppkjøp eller frasalg**. Det kan oppstå forhold der Honeywell av strategiske eller andre forretningsgrunner bestemmer seg for å selge, kjøpe, selge, slå sammen eller på annen måte omorganisere virksomheter i noen land. Vi kan avsløre informasjon vi har om deg i den grad det er rimelig nødvendig for å fortsette med forhandling eller fullføring av fusjon, oppkjøp, avhendelse eller salg av hele eller deler av Honeywells eiendeler.
* **Utlevering av andre årsaker**. Det kan hende vi offentliggjør personopplysninger hvis nødvendig eller autorisert til å gjøre dette ifølge lov, eller når vi i god tro mener en slik handling er nødvendig for å etterleve juridiske krav, eller opptre riktig i forbindelse med søksmål mot oss, for å beskytte og forsvare våre rettigheter eller vår eiendom, eller for å beskytte den personlige sikkerheten til en person under presserende omstendigheter.

**Internasjonale overføringer**

Honeywell er en global organisasjon, og din personopplysningene dine kan overføres til, oppbevares, lagres eller brukes på forskjellige steder over hele verden som USA, Mexico og India i samsvar med gjeldende lov. Dette betyr at når vi samler inn personopplysningene dine, kan de bli behandlet i land som kan ha databeskyttelseslover som er forskjellige fra lovene i ditt land. Imidlertid vil Honeywell alltid ta rimelige tiltak for å beskytte personvernet ditt og for å gi et nivå av beskyttelse av personopplysninger som er sammenlignbar med den i bostedslandet ditt, inkludert implementering av EU-kommisjonens standardavtaleklausuler. For mer informasjon om hensiktsmessige tiltak for å beskytte personopplysningene dine kan du kontakte oss på [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com).

**Sikkerhet**

Vi er forpliktet til å verne personopplysninger om deg. Vi bruker tekniske og organisatoriske tiltak for å gi et sikkerhetsnivå som passer til risikoen for å behandle personopplysningene dine. For mer informasjon om hvordan Honeywell beskytter personopplysningene dine kan du kontakte oss på [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com)

**Dine rettigheter**

Avhengig av gjeldende lov kan du ha visse rettigheter med hensyn til personopplysningene dine.

* Du kan ha rett til å **få tilgang til, korrigere, oppdatere** eller **be om sletting** av personopplysningene dine.
* Du kan **protestere** mot behandlingen av personopplysningene dine, be oss om å **begrense** behandlingen av personopplysningene dine eller be om **portabilitet** av personopplysningene dine.
* Du kan ha rett **til at det ikke tas en beslutning om deg som bare er basert på automatisert behandling, inkludert profilering,** hvis avgjørelsen gir rettsvirkninger for deg eller påvirker deg betydelig.
* Tilsvarende, hvis vi har samlet inn og behandlet personopplysningene dine med ditt samtykke, **kan du når som helst trekke tilbake samtykket ditt**. Å trekke tilbake samtykket ditt vil ikke påvirke lovligheten av behandling vi har utført før du trakk det tilbake, og det vil heller ikke påvirke behandlingen av personopplysningene dine som er utført på annet lovlig behandlingsgrunnlag enn samtykke.
* Du kan ha rett til **å velge bort salg av personopplysningene dine**. Honeywell selger ikke personopplysningene dine til tredjeparter for fortjeneste. Imidlertid deler vi eller på annen måte avslører personopplysningene dine til tredjeparter i samsvar med denne personvernerklæringen og vår [Merknad om informasjonskapsler](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/cookie-notice#norwegian). For eksempel samarbeider vi med tredjeparter for å distribuere våre produkter, gi deg teknisk assistanse, bruke analyseverktøy og -funksjoner på nettstedet og delta i markedsføring og salg av våre produkter og tjenester. Slike aktiviteter kan innebære utlevering av personopplysningene dine til tredjepart og kan betraktes som et "salg" av data under visse (men ikke alle) lover om databeskyttelse.
* Du har rett til å **klage** til en databeskyttelsesmyndighet som er ansvarlig for å overvåke overholdelse av databeskyttelsesloven i din jurisdiksjon om vår innsamling og bruk av personopplysningene dine hvis du mener at behandlingen av personopplysningene dine ikke er i samsvar med databeskyttelsesloven. For eksempel har personer i EØS rett til å inngi en klage til den kompetente datatilsynsmyndigheten. Det finnes en liste over slike myndigheter på: [https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members\_en](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en). Vi vil imidlertid sette pris på muligheten til å løse dine bekymringer, så ikke nøl med å ta kontakt med oss hvis det er noe du vil klage på. Vi vil ikke diskriminere enkeltpersoner for å utøve sine personvernrettigheter.

Vi vil tilrettelegge utøvelsen av rettighetene som gjelder for deg i samsvar med gjeldende lov. Selv om personopplysningene dine ikke er gitt beskyttelse i henhold til eller på annen måte er underlagt en databeskyttelseslov, kan vi imidlertid søke å imøtekomme enhver forespørsel du måtte ha om våre databehandlingsaktiviteter. Hvis du har spørsmål om dine rettigheter eller ønsker å utøve dine rettigheter, kan du kontakte oss på [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com) eller sende personvernspørsmål via vårt interaktive webskjema på følgende lenke:

Nettstedene våre er ikke rettet mot, og skal ikke brukes av, barn under seksten (16) år, og vi samler inn, bruker eller selger ikke bevisst informasjon fra slike personer. Hvis du er mindreårig i henhold til lovene i ditt land, må du ikke sende inn personopplysninger via våre nettsteder.

**Lenker til andre nettsteder**

Nettstedene våre kan inneholde lenker til tredjeparters nettsteder, produkter og tjenester.

* **Podania o pracę**. W związku z podaniem lub zapytaniem o pracę użytkownik może przekazać nam informacje o sobie, takie jak życiorys (CV), referencje zawodowe, informacje na temat wykształcenia i historii zatrudnienia oraz szkoleń zawodowych i certyfikatów. My i członkowie naszej grupy możemy wykorzystywać te informacje w celu rozpatrywania podań o pracę, weryfikacji historii zatrudnienia i kwalifikowania się użytkownika do zatrudnienia, a także w inny sposób określony w każdym odrębnym oświadczeniu o ochronie prywatności lub innych informacjach udostępnionych w związku z podaniem użytkownika. Możemy korzystać z usług osoby trzeciej (np. agencji rekrutacyjnej) lub platformy mediów społecznościowych w celu pozyskiwania, gromadzenia i przechowywania podań o pracę. Więcej informacji można uzyskać w naszym [Oświadczeniu o ochronie prywatności dla kandydatów do pracy](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/applicant-privacy-notice#polish).

* **Egzekwowanie**. Możemy wykorzystywać zebrane przez nas dane osobowe w celach wykrywania oszustw, naruszeń praw własności intelektualnej i postanowień naszych warunków, naruszeń prawa lub innych przypadków niewłaściwego korzystania z naszych Witryn, a także zapobiegania takim oszustwom, naruszeniom i niewłaściwemu korzystaniu oraz reagowania na nie.

W zakresie dozwolonym przez prawo możemy łączyć dane gromadzone za pośrednictwem naszych Witryn z naszymi innymi danymi o użytkowniku (takimi jak informacje o korzystaniu przez niego z naszych produktów i usług) w celu zapewnienia mu lepszej i bardziej spójnej obsługi podczas interakcji z nami lub w innych celach określonych w tym Oświadczeniu o ochronie prywatności.

**Podstawa prawna przetwarzania danych**

Jeśli jest to wymagane przez prawo, upewniamy się, że istnieje podstawa prawna przetwarzania danych osobowych użytkownika. W większości przypadków nasza podstawa prawna będzie zależeć od danych osobowych i konkretnego kontekstu, w jakim je gromadzimy.

* **Umowa**: przetwarzanie jest niezbędne w celu świadczenia usług, które realizujemy na rzecz użytkownika, lub w celu podjęcia kroków (na żądanie użytkownika) przed wykonaniem takich usług i przewidując takie wykonanie;
* **Obowiązek prawny**: przetwarzanie danych jest konieczne w celu wypełnienia naszych zobowiązań prawnych, w tym przestrzegania obowiązujących przepisów i regulacji, nakazów rządowych i quasi-rządowych oraz zarządzeń sądu lub wezwań sądowych;
* **Zgoda**: przetwarzanie odbywa się w oparciu o wyrażoną przez użytkownika zgodę na przetwarzanie jego danych osobowych w jednym lub kilku określonych celach (np. marketingowych);
* **Uzasadnione interesy**: przetwarzanie jest konieczne do realizacji naszych uzasadnionych interesów, na przykład w celu rozwoju i doskonalenia naszych Witryn, produktów i/lub usług na rzecz naszych klientów; lub
* **Żywotne interesy**: przetwarzanie jest niezbędne do ochrony żywotnych interesów użytkownika (na przykład ze względu na zdrowie i bezpieczeństwo, jeśli użytkownik uczestniczy w spotkaniu w lokalizacji firmy Honeywell).

W razie jakichkolwiek pytań lub potrzeby uzyskania dalszych informacji na temat podstawy prawnej zbierania i wykorzystywania przez nas danych osobowych prosimy o wysłanie wiadomości e-mail na adres: [HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com)

**Anonimizacja danych**

Zgodnie z obowiązującymi przepisami możemy przeprowadzić anonimizację danych osobowych użytkownika, aby nie mogły być już wykorzystywane do celów jego identyfikacji. Zanonimizowane dane nie są uznawane za dane osobowe i dlatego nie podlegają niniejszemu Oświadczeniu o ochronie prywatności. Możemy gromadzić, wykorzystywać, agregować i udostępniać zanonimizowane dane w dowolnym celu.

**Czas przechowywania danych**

Okres przechowywania danych osobowych użytkownika różni się w zależności od celu przetwarzania. Na przykład przechowujemy dane osobowe niezbędne do dostarczania produktów i świadczenia usług lub ułatwiania realizowania transakcji żądanych przez użytkownika tak długo, jak będzie on klientem firmy Honeywell, lub jeśli złoży on podanie o pracę za pośrednictwem naszych Witryn, zachowamy informacje na temat tego podania przez czas określony w informacji o ochronie prywatności udostępnionej mu w związku z podaniem lub zgodnie z innymi wymogami prawa. We wszystkich innych przypadkach przechowujemy dane osobowe użytkownika tak długo, jak to jest konieczne do realizacji celów określonych w tym Oświadczeniu o ochronie prywatności. Po tym czasie są one anonimizowane (jeśli jest to dozwolone przez obowiązujące prawo), usuwane lub niszczone.

**Ujawnianie danych**

Możemy udostępniać dane osobowe użytkownika wybranym osobom trzecim zgodnie z obowiązującym prawem, w tym w sposób opisany poniżej:

* **Spółki wchodzące w skład naszej grupy**. Możemy udostępniać dane osobowe użytkownika naszym podmiotom stowarzyszonym i firmom należącym do grupy, gdy będzie to w uzasadnionym zakresie niezbędne do celów określonych w tym Oświadczeniu o ochronie prywatności.
* **Usługodawcy**. Możemy udostępniać dane osobowe użytkownika firmom, którym zleciliśmy świadczenie w naszym imieniu takich usług, jak hosting witryn internetowych, przeprowadzanie ankiet, przetwarzanie transakcji, analiza naszych Witryn i przeprowadzanie analiz w celu usprawnienia naszej działalności oraz udoskonalenia Witryn, produktów i usług. Wymagamy od tych usługodawców ochrony poufności danych osobowych użytkownika.
* **Dystrybutorzy i inni zaufani partnerzy biznesowi**. Możemy udostępniać dane osobowe użytkownika osobom trzecim zajmującym się dystrybucją naszych produktów i innym zaufanym partnerom biznesowym w celu umożliwienia im wysyłania materiałów marketingowych do użytkownika. Ten proces udostępniania danych osobowych w celach marketingowych będzie odbywać się zgodnie z obowiązującymi przepisami i regulacjami prawnymi.
* **Ujawnianie danych w związku z transakcjami**. W związku z niektórymi transakcjami możemy ujawniać niektóre lub wszystkie dane osobowe użytkownika instytucjom finansowym, podmiotom rządowym oraz firmom wysyłkowym i poczcie, które biorą udział w realizacji transakcji.
* **Ujawnianie danych związane z transakcjami przejęcia lub zbycia**. W niektórych okolicznościach ze względów strategicznych lub innych powodów biznesowych firma Honeywell może podjąć decyzję o sprzedaży, zakupie, zbyciu, fuzji lub innej reorganizacji działalności w niektórych krajach. Możemy ujawniać przechowywane przez nas dane użytkownika w uzasadnionym zakresie koniecznym do prowadzenia negocjacji lub realizacji fuzji, przejęcia, zbycia lub sprzedaży całości bądź części aktywów firmy Honeywell.
* **Ujawnianie danych z innych powodów**. Możemy ujawniać dane osobowe, gdy wymaga tego prawo lub w dobrej wierze, że takie działanie jest niezbędne w celu przestrzegania wymogów prawnych lub prowadzonych wobec nas procesów prawnych, w celu ochrony i obrony naszych praw lub mienia, bądź w szczególnych okolicznościach w celu ochrony osobistego bezpieczeństwa dowolnej osoby.

**Międzynarodowe transfery danych**

Honeywell jest firmą globalną i dane osobowe użytkownika mogą być przekazywane do różnych krajów na całym świecie, takich jak Stany Zjednoczone, Meksyk i Indie, a także przechowywane lub wykorzystywane w takich krajach zgodnie z obowiązującym prawem. Oznacza to, że gdy gromadzimy dane osobowe użytkownika, mogą być one przetwarzane w krajach, w których mogą obowiązywać przepisy o ochronie danych różniące się od przepisów kraju użytkownika. Firma Honeywell zawsze podejmie jednak uzasadnione kroki w celu ochrony prywatności użytkownika i zapewnienia mu poziomu ochrony danych osobowych porównywalnego z poziomem ochrony w kraju jego zamieszkania, co obejmuje wdrożenie standardowych klauzul umownych Komisji Europejskiej. Aby uzyskać więcej informacji na temat odpowiednich zabezpieczeń stosowanych w celu ochrony danych osobowych, prosimy o skontaktowanie się z nami pod adresem: [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com).

**Bezpieczeństwo**

Zobowiązujemy się do ochrony bezpieczeństwa danych osobowych użytkowników. Stosujemy środki techniczne i organizacyjne, aby zapewnić poziom bezpieczeństwa odpowiedni do ryzyka przetwarzania danych osobowych użytkownika. Aby uzyskać więcej informacji na temat ochrony danych osobowych przez firmę Honeywell, prosimy o skontaktowanie się z nami pod adresem [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com)

**Prawa użytkownika**

W zależności od obowiązujących przepisów użytkownik może mieć określone prawa w odniesieniu do swoich danych osobowych.

* Użytkownik może mieć prawo **dostępu do swoich danych osobowych, ich poprawiania lub aktualizowania** lub **żądania ich usunięcia.**
* Użytkownik może **wyrazić sprzeciw** wobec przetwarzania swoich danych osobowych, zażądać od nas **ograniczenia** przetwarzania jego danych osobowych lub ich **przeniesienia**.
* Użytkownik może mieć prawo **do tego, aby nie podejmowano dotyczącej go decyzji w oparciu o wyłącznie zautomatyzowane przetwarzanie, w tym profilowanie,** jeśli taka decyzja wywołuje skutki prawne dotyczące użytkownika lub znacząco na niego wpływa.
* Podobnie, jeśli dane użytkownika zostały zebrane i są przetwarzane przez nas za jego zgodą, wówczas **może on w każdej chwili wycofać swoją zgodę**. Wycofanie zgody nie będzie miało wpływu na zgodność z prawem przetwarzania prowadzonego wcześniej ani nie wpłynie na przetwarzanie danych osobowych użytkownika w oparciu o zgodne z prawem podstawy przetwarzania inne niż zgoda.
* Użytkownik może mieć prawo do **rezygnacji ze sprzedaży swoich danych osobowych**. Firma Honeywell nie sprzedaje danych osobowych użytkowników osobom trzecim w celach zarobkowych. Udostępniamy jednak lub w inny sposób ujawniamy dane osobowe użytkowników osobom trzecim zgodnie z tym Oświadczeniem o ochronie prywatności i [Informacjami o plikach cookie](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/cookie-notice#polish). Na przykład współpracujemy z osobami trzecimi w celu dystrybucji naszych produktów, świadczenia użytkownikom pomocy technicznej, obsługi narzędzi i funkcji analitycznych w witrynie internetowej, a także prowadzenia marketingu i sprzedaży naszych produktów i usług. Takie działania mogą wiązać się z ujawnianiem danych osobowych użytkownika osobom trzecim i zgodnie z niektórymi (ale nie wszystkimi) przepisami o ochronie danych mogą być uznawane za „sprzedaż” danych.
* Użytkownik ma prawo **złożyć skargę** do organu ds. ochrony danych odpowiedzialnego za nadzór nad przestrzeganiem przepisów o ochronie danych w jurysdykcji użytkownika w związku z gromadzeniem i wykorzystywaniem przez nas jego danych osobowych, jeśli uzna, że nie jest ono zgodne z przepisami o ochronie danych. Na przykład osoby fizyczne w EOG mają prawo złożyć skargę do właściwego organu ds. ochrony danych; wykaz takich organów jest dostępny pod adresem: [https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members\_en](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en). Mamy jednak nadzieję, że zanim to nastąpi, użytkownik da nam szansę na rozwiązanie wszelkich zgłoszonych przez niego problemów, dlatego prosimy o kontakt w sprawie jakiejkolwiek ewentualnej skargi. Nie będziemy dyskryminować żadnych osób fizycznych w związku z korzystaniem przez nie z ich praw do ochrony danych.

Ułatwimy użytkownikowi korzystanie z praw, które mają do niego zastosowanie zgodnie z obowiązującym prawem. Jednak nawet jeśli dane osobowe użytkownika nie są chronione na mocy przepisów o ochronie danych lub nie podlegają im z innej przyczyny, możemy postarać się zrealizować wszelkie żądania lub zapytania, jakie użytkownik może mieć w związku z naszymi działaniami dotyczącymi przetwarzania danych. W razie pytań dotyczących praw użytkownika lub chęci ich wykonania prosimy o skontaktowanie się z nami pod adresem [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.co](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com)m lub o przesłanie pytań dotyczących prywatności za pośrednictwem naszego interaktywnego formularza online dostępnego po kliknięciu poniższego łącza:

**Łącza do innych witryn internetowych**

Nie ponosimy żadnej odpowiedzialności za te witryny internetowe, produkty, usługi i obowiązujące w nich zasady ani za gromadzenie w nich lub przetwarzanie w inny sposób danych osobowych użytkownika. Praktyki tych osób trzecich podlegają ich własnym zasadom ochrony prywatności. Zachęcamy do zapoznania się z zasadami ochrony prywatności tych osób trzecich.

Если у вас есть какие-либо вопросы или вам нужна дополнительная информация о правовых основаниях, на которых мы собираем и используем ваши персональные данные, отправьте электронное письмо по адресу [HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com).

**Анонимизация данных**

В соответствии с применимым законодательством мы можем обеспечивать анонимность персональных данных, чтобы их невозможно было использовать для идентификации личности. Анонимизированные данные не считаются персональными данными и поэтому не попадают под действие настоящего Заявления о конфиденциальности. Мы можем собирать, использовать, объединять и передавать анонимную информацию в любых целях.

**Сроки хранения данных**

Период хранения персональных данных зависит от цели обработки. Например, мы храним персональные данные, необходимые для предоставления вам продуктов и услуг или для выполнения запрашиваемых вами транзакций, пока вы являетесь клиентом компании Honeywell. Если вы подаете заявление о приеме на работу через наши веб-сайты, мы будем хранить информацию о вашем заявлении, как указано в уведомлении о конфиденциальности, предоставленном вам в связи с вашим заявлением, или в соответствии с требованиями закона. Во всех других случаях мы храним персональные данные до тех пор, пока они необходимы для наших целей, изложенных в настоящем Заявлении о конфиденциальности, после чего мы либо анонимизируем данные (если это разрешено применимым законодательством), либо удаляем, либо уничтожаем их.

**Раскрытие данных**

Мы можем передавать ваши персональные данные выбранным третьим лицам в соответствии с применимым законодательством, в том числе, как указано ниже.

* **Наша группа компаний**. Мы также можем предоставлять ваши персональные данные своим аффилированным лицам и компаниям из нашей группы, когда это оправдано необходимо в целях, описанных в этом Заявлении о конфиденциальности.
* **Поставщики услуг**. Мы можем предоставлять персональные данные другим компаниям, с которыми у нас заключены договоры на предоставление услуг от нашего имени, таких как хостинг веб-сайтов, проведение опросов, обработка операций, анализ наших сайтов и выполнение анализа для улучшения качества нашей работы, сайтов, продуктов и услуг. Мы требуем, чтобы эти поставщики услуг обеспечивали конфиденциальность ваших персональных данных.
* **Дистрибьюторы и другие доверенные деловые партнеры**. Мы можем передавать ваши персональные данные третьим лицам, которые распространяют наши продукты, и другим доверенным деловым партнерам в целях, позволяющих этим третьим лицам отправлять вам рекламные материалы. Предоставление персональных данных в маркетинговых целях осуществляется в соответствии с применимыми законами и нормами.
* **Предоставление информации в связи со сделками**. В связи с некоторыми сделками мы можем сообщить некоторую часть или все ваши персональные данные финансовым учреждениям, правительственным организациям и транспортным компаниям, а также почтовым службам, привлеченным к осуществлению сделки.
* **Разглашение в связи с приобретением или ликвидацией компании**. В связи с обстоятельствами в стратегических целях или по иным деловым соображениям корпорация Honeywell может решить продать, купить, разделить, объединить посредством слияния или иначе реорганизовать свои предприятия в некоторых странах. Мы можем раскрыть имеющуюся о вас информацию до степени, достаточной для продолжения переговоров или завершения слияния, приобретения, разделения или продажи всех или части активов компании Honeywell.
* **Разглашение информации по другим причинам**. Мы можем раскрыть персональные данные, если это требуется или разрешено по закону или исходя из добросовестного предположения, что такое действие необходимо для соблюдения законных требований или врученного нам постановления суда, для защиты наших прав и имущества или в чрезвычайных обстоятельствах для защиты личной безопасности того или иного физического лица.

**Передача данных в другие страны**

Компания Honeywell является глобальной организацией, и ваши персональные данные могут передаваться, находиться, храниться или использоваться в различных регионах по всему миру, например в США, Мексике и Индии, в соответствии с действующим законодательством. Это означает, что когда мы собираем ваши персональные данные, они могут обрабатываться в странах, в которых законы о защите данных могут отличаться от законов вашей страны. Тем не менее, компания Honeywell всегда будет принимать разумные меры для защиты вашей конфиденциальности и обеспечения уровня защиты персональных данных, сопоставимого с уровнем защиты в вашей стране проживания, включая выполнение Стандартных договорных положений, утвержденных Европейской комиссией. Чтобы получить дополнительную информацию о соответствующих мерах защиты ваших персональных данных, свяжитесь с нами по адресу [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com).

**Безопасность**

Мы стремимся предпринять все возможные действия для защиты ваших персональных данных. Мы принимаем технические и организационные меры для обеспечения уровня безопасности, соответствующего риску, связанному с обработкой ваших персональных данных. Для получения дополнительной информации о том, как Honeywell защищает ваши персональные данные, свяжитесь с нами по адресу [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com).

В зависимости от применимого законодательства у вас могут быть определенные права в отношении ваших персональных данных.

* Вы можете иметь право **на доступ, исправление, обновление** или **удаление** ваших персональных данных.
* Вы можете **возражать** против обработки ваших персональных данных, просить нас **ограничит**ь обработку ваших персональных данных или требовать переноса ваших персональных данных.
* Вы можете иметь право **на то, чтобы в отношении вас не принимались решения, основанные исключительно на автоматической обработке, включая профилирование,** если эти решения создают для вас юридические последствия или оказывают иное значительное влияние на вас.
* Также, если мы собираем и обрабатываем ваши персональные данные с вашего согласия, **вы можете отозвать свое согласие в любое время**. Отзыв вашего согласия не повлияет на законность обработки, которую мы выполняли до отзыва согласия, а также не повлияет на обработку ваших персональных данных, проводимую на законных основаниях, отличных от согласия.
* Вы можете иметь право **отказаться от продажи ваших персональных данных**. Компания Honeywell не продает ваши персональные данные третьим лицам с целью получения прибыли. Однако мы передаем или иным образом раскрываем ваши персональные данные третьим лицам в соответствии с настоящим Заявлением о конфиденциальности и нашим [Уведомлением о файлах cookie](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/cookie-notice#russian). Например, мы взаимодействуем с третьими лицами для распространения наших продуктов, предоставления вам технической помощи, использования аналитических инструментов и функций веб-сайта, а также маркетинга и продаж наших продуктов и услуг. Такие действия могут включать раскрытие ваших персональных данных третьим лицам и могут рассматриваться как «продажа» данных в соответствии с некоторыми (но не всеми) законами о защите данных.
* Вы имеете право **подавать жалобы** в органы власти, контролирующие соблюдение законов о защите данных в вашей юрисдикции, в отношении сбора и использования ваших персональных данных, если вы считаете, что обработка нами ваших персональных данных не соответствует закону о защите данных. Например, лица в ЕЭЗ имеют право подать жалобу в компетентный орган по защите данных, список которых можно найти по адресу: [https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members\_en](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en). Тем не менее мы будет рады помочь вам решить ваши вопросы, поэтому не стесняйтесь обращаться к нам с любой жалобой. Мы не будем дискриминировать кого-либо за осуществление прав на конфиденциальность данных.

Мы будем обеспечивать соблюдение ваших прав в соответствии с применимым законодательством. Однако, даже если ваши персональные данные не защищены законом о защите данных или каким-либо иным образом не подпадают под его действие, мы будем стараться удовлетворить любой ваш запрос или требование в отношении нашей деятельности по обработке данных. Если у вас есть вопросы о ваших правах или вы хотите воспользоваться своими правами, свяжитесь с нами по адресу [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com) или отправьте вопросы о конфиденциальности через нашу интерактивную веб-форму по следующей ссылке:

Takéto činnosti môžu zahŕňať zverejňovanie vašich osobných údajov tretím stranám a podľa určitých (ale nie všetkých) právnych predpisov na ochranu údajov sa môžu považovať za „predaj“ údajov.

Por ejemplo, nos relacionamos con terceros para distribuir nuestros productos, proporcionarle asistencia técnica, operar herramientas y funciones analíticas de sitios web, y participar en el marketing y las ventas de nuestros productos y servicios. Estas actividades pueden implicar la revelación de su información personal a terceros y puedes ser consideradas "ventas" de datos según ciertas (pero no todas) leyes de protección de datos.

Vi kan också samla in din företagskontaktinformation via din arbetsgivare eller andra tredje parter för att underlätta eller på annat sätt delta i traditionell affärsverksamhet och liknande administrativa frågor.

**Användning av information**

Vi kan använda den personliga information som samlas in via våra webbplatser eller när du kontaktar oss för ändamål som inkluderar:

* **Företagskontaktinformation.** Honeywell samlar in och använder företagskontaktinformation för att delta i kommunikation eller transaktioner, inklusive för att vidta skälig aktsamhet avseende, eller vid tillhandahållandet eller mottagandet av, en produkt eller tjänst. Honeywell kan till exempel samla in och använda denna företagskontaktinformation för att underlätta och hantera beställningar, kontrakt, garantier, underhåll och liknande affärsfunktioner, för kreditanalys och insamlingsändamål, för att hjälpa till med vår egen interna efterlevnad och juridiska krav och (om nödvändigt) för att försvara våra intressen och anspråk.

Du kan när som helst och utan kostnad välja bort marknadsföringskommunikation som skickas via e-post genom att använda länken ”avanmälan” i något av det marknadsföringsmaterial du får från oss via e-post, eller genom att kontakta oss med hjälp av kontaktinformationen som anges i denna sekretesspolicy. Beroende på i vilket land du bor kan du också välja bort andra typer av marknadsföringskommunikation; vänligen kontakta oss med hjälp av kontaktinformationen i sekretesspolicyn för mer information. Vissa jurisdiktioner ger individer (t.ex. invånare i Kalifornien) rätten att begära viss information om vår utlämning av personlig information till tredje part för tredje parts direkta marknadsföringsändamål. Kontakta oss enligt instruktionerna nedan för mer information om vår praxis gällande utlämning av uppgifter för marknadsföringsändamål.

I den utsträckning som lagen tillåter kan vi också använda all personlig information som du tillhandahåller i samband med ett program med ekonomiska incitament för något annat syfte som anges i denna sekretesspolicy. Det är viktigt att du läser igenom villkoren för varje program med ekonomiska incitament som du vill registrera dig eller delta i eftersom dessa villkor kan vara mycket specifikt anpassade till det tillämpliga programmet. Om du samtycker till att delta i något av dessa program kan du när som helst dra tillbaka ditt samtycke genom att kontakta oss via kontaktuppgifterna i denna sekretesspolicy eller i enlighet med instruktionerna som anges i de tillämpliga villkoren.

Vi och medlemmar i vår koncern kan använda denna information i syfte att överväga anställning, göra bakgrundskontroller och utvärdera anställningslämplighet och annat som anges i varje separat sekretesspolicy eller annat meddelande som görs tillgängligt i samband med din ansökan. Vi kan använda en tredje part (t.ex. jobbrekryterare) eller sociala medieplattformar för att värva, samla in och behålla jobbansökningar.

* **Tillämpning:** Vi kan använda den personliga informationen vi samlar in för att upptäcka, förhindra och svara på bedrägerier, intrång i immateriella rättigheter, brott mot våra villkor, överträdelser av lag eller annat missbruk av våra webbplatser.

Där lagen tillåter kan vi kombinera informationen som vi samlar in via våra webbplatser med annan information som vi har om dig (så som information om din användning av våra produkter och tjänster) för att erbjuda dig en förbättrad och konsekvent kundupplevelse när du interagerar med oss eller för andra ändamål som anges i denna sekretesspolicy.

**Den rättsliga grunden på vilken vi behandlar information**

Där det krävs enligt lag kommer vi att se till att det finns en rättslig grund för behandlingen av din personliga information. I de flesta fall beror vår rättsliga grund på berörd personlig information och det specifika sammanhang där vi samlar in den.

* **Kontrakt:** behandlingen är nödvändig för utförandet av de tjänster vi tillhandahåller dig, eller för att vidta åtgärder (på din begäran) före utförandet, och vid förväntan att utföra, sådana tjänster;
* **Juridisk skyldighet:** behandlingen är nödvändig för att uppfylla våra juridiska skyldigheter, inklusive efterlevnad av tillämpliga lagar, förordningar, statliga och kvasistatliga begäranden, domstolsbeslut eller stämningar;
* **Samtycke:** behandlingen baseras på ditt samtycke till behandlingen av din personliga information för ett eller flera specifika ändamål (t.ex. marknadsföring);

Om du har några frågor eller behöver ytterligare information om den rättsliga grund på vilken vi samlar in och använder din personliga information, skicka ett e-postmeddelande till [HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com).

**Anonymisering av information**

I enlighet med tillämplig lag kan vi anonymisera din personliga information så att den inte längre kan användas för att identifiera dig. Anonymiserad information anses inte vara personlig information och omfattas därför inte av denna sekretesspolicy. Vi kan samla in, använda, aggregera och dela anonymiserad information för alla syften.

**Hur länge vi behåller uppgifter**

Perioden under vilken vi lagrar din personliga information varierar beroende på syftet med behandlingen. Vi lagrar till exempel personlig information som behövs för att förse dig med produkter och tjänster, eller för att underlätta transaktioner du har begärt, så länge du är kund hos Honeywell eller om du skickar in en jobbansökan via våra webbplatser kommer vi att behålla information om din ansökan enligt beskrivningen i sekretessmeddelandet som görs tillgängligt för dig i samband med din ansökan eller på annat sätt krävs enligt lag. I alla andra fall lagrar vi din personliga information så länge som behövs för att uppfylla de syften som beskrivs i denna sekretesspolicy, varefter den antingen anonymiseras (där det är tillåtet enligt tillämplig lag), raderas eller förstörs.

**Utlämning av information**

Vi kan dela din personliga information med utvalda tredje parter i enlighet med tillämplig lag, inklusive enligt vad som anges nedan:

* **Våra koncernföretag.** Vi kan dela din personliga information med våra dotterbolag och koncernföretag enligt vad som är rimligt nödvändigt för de ändamål som anges i denna sekretesspolicy.

Vi kräver att dessa tjänsteleverantörer skyddar din personliga informations konfidentialitet.
* **Distributörer och andra betrodda affärspartner.** Vi kan dela din personliga information med tredje part som distribuerar våra produkter och andra betrodda affärspartner för ändamål som inkluderar att dessa tredje parter kan skicka marknadsföringskommunikation till dig. Sådan delning av personlig information för marknadsföringsändamål kommer att ske i enlighet med tillämpliga lagar och regler.
* **Utlämning i samband med transaktioner.** I samband med vissa transaktioner kan vi lämna ut någon eller all din personliga information till finansinstitut, statliga enheter och rederier eller posttjänster som är involverade i genomförandet av transaktionen.
* **Utlämningar i samband med förvärv eller avyttringar.** Omständigheter kan uppstå om Honeywell av strategiska eller andra affärsskäl beslutar att sälja, köpa, avyttra, slå samman eller på annat sätt omorganisera företag i vissa länder. Vi kan lämna ut information som vi har om dig i den utsträckning som är rimligt nödvändigt för att fortsätta med förhandlingarna eller slutförandet av en sammanslagning, förvärv, avyttring eller försäljning av hela eller en del av Honeywells tillgångar.
* **Utlämning av andra skäl.** Vi kan lämna ut personlig information om detta krävs eller bemyndigas enligt lag eller i god tro och det är nödvändigt för att följa rättsliga krav eller för en juridisk process som delges oss, för att skydda och försvara våra rättigheter eller egendom, under brådskande omständigheter, för att skydda varje individs personliga säkerhet.

**Internationella överföringar**

Honeywell är en global organisation och din personliga information kan överföras till, förvaras, lagras eller användas över olika platser världen över, så som USA, Mexiko och Indien i enlighet med tillämplig lag. Detta innebär att när vi samlar in din personliga information kan den behandlas i länder som kan ha dataskyddslagar som skiljer sig från lagarna i ditt land. Honeywell kommer dock alltid att vidta rimliga åtgärder för att skydda din integritet och för att tillhandahålla en skyddsnivå för personlig information som är jämförbar med den i ditt bosättningsland, inklusive implementering av Europeiska kommissionens standardavtalsklausuler. För mer information om lämpliga skyddsåtgärder för att skydda din personliga information, vänligen kontakta oss på [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com).

**Säkerhet**

Vi arbetar för att upprätthålla säkerheten för dina personuppgifter. Vi använder tekniska och organisatoriska åtgärder för att tillhandahålla en säkerhetsnivå som är lämplig för behandlingen av din personliga information. För mer information om hur Honeywell skyddar din personliga information, vänligen kontakta oss på [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com).

**Dina rättigheter**

Beroende på tillämplig lag kan du ha vissa rättigheter med avseende på din personliga information.

* Du kan ha rätt att **få tillgång till, korrigera, uppdatera** eller **begära radering** av din personliga information.
* Du kan **motsätta dig** behandlingen av din personliga information, be oss att **begränsa** behandlingen av din personliga information eller begära **flyttbarhet** av din personliga information.
* Du kan ha rätt **att inte få ett beslut fattat om dig som enbart baseras på automatiserad behandling, inklusive profilering** om beslutet i fråga leder till rättsliga effekter för dig eller påverkar dig på något väsentligt sätt.
* På samma sätt, om vi har samlat in och behandlat din personliga information med ditt samtycke, **kan du när som helst dra tillbaka ditt samtycke**. Tillbakadragande av ditt samtycke påverkar inte lagenligheten av all behandling som vi genomfört före ditt tillbakadragande och det kommer inte heller att påverka behandlingen av din personliga information som utförs beroende av andra lagliga behandlingsgrunder än samtycke.
* Du kan ha rätt att **välja bort försäljning av din personliga information**. Honeywell säljer inte din personliga information till tredje part för vinst. Vi delar eller lämnar dock ut din personliga information till tredje part i enlighet med denna sekretesspolicy och vårt [Meddelande om användning av cookies](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/cookie-notice#swedish). Till exempel samarbetar vi med tredje part för att distribuera våra produkter, tillhandahålla teknisk hjälp, använda verktyg för analys av webbplatser och funktioner samt bedriva marknadsföring och försäljning av våra produkter och tjänster. Sådana aktiviteter kan innebära att din personliga information lämnas ut till tredje part och kan betraktas som en ”försäljning” av uppgifter enligt vissa (men inte alla) dataskyddslagar.
* Du har rätt att **lämna klagomål** till en dataskyddsmyndighet som ansvarar för att övervaka efterlevnaden av dataskyddslagen i din jurisdiktion gällande vår insamling och användning av din personliga information om du anser att vår behandling av din personliga information inte överensstämmer med dataskyddslagen. Till exempel har enskilda personer inom EES rätt att lämna in ett klagomål till den behöriga dataskyddsmyndigheten, vars lista kan nås på: [https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members\_en](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en). Vi skulle dock uppskatta att få möjligheten att ta itu med dina frågor, så kontakta oss gärna angående eventuella klagomål. Vi diskriminerar inte individer för att de utövar sina dataskyddsrättigheter.

Vi kommer att underlätta ditt utövande av de rättigheter som gäller för dig i enlighet med tillämplig lag. Men även om din personliga information inte ges skydd enligt eller på annat sätt omfattas av en dataskyddslag kan vi försöka tillgodose de krav eller förfrågningar du har om vår databehandling. Om du har frågor om dina rättigheter eller vill utöva dina rättigheter kan du kontakta oss på [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com) eller skicka in dina frågor rörande sekretess via vårt interaktiva webbformulär på följande länk:

Kişisel bilgilerinizi toplamamızın ve kullanmamızın yasal dayanağı hakkında herhangi bir sorunuz varsa veya daha fazla bilgiye ihtiyacınız varsa, [HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com) adresine e-posta gönderin.

**Bilgilerinizin anonimleştirilmesi**

Yürürlükteki yasalara uygun olarak kişisel bilgilerinizi sizi tanımlama amacıyla kullanılamaması için anonim hale getirebiliriz. Anonimleştirilmiş bilgiler kişisel bilgi olarak kabul edilmez ve bu nedenle bu Gizlilik Bildirimine tabi değildir. Anonimleştirilmiş bilgileri herhangi bir amaç için toplayabilir, kullanabilir, bir araya getirebilir ve paylaşabiliriz.

**Bilgilerinizi saklama süremiz**

Kişisel bilgilerinizi depoladığımız süre işlemenin amacına göre değişiklik gösterir. Örneğin, size ürünler veya hizmetler sunmak veya talep ettiğiniz işlemleri gerçekleştirmek için gereken kişisel bilgileri, Honeywell müşterisi olduğunuz süre boyunca depolarız veya Sitelerimiz üzerinden bir iş başvurusu göndermeniz halinde başvurunuzla bağlantılı olarak size sunulan gizlilik bildiriminde veya diğer bildirimlerde belirtildiği şekilde ya da yasaların gerektirdiği başka şekillerde başvurunuzun detaylarını tutarız. Diğer tüm durumlarda kişisel bilgilerinizi bu Gizlilik Bildiriminde belirtilen amaçları karşılamak için gereken süre boyunca depolarız, sonrasında bu bilgiler anonim hale getirilir (yürürlükteki yasaların izin verdiği durumlarda), silinir veya imha edilir.

**Bilgilerin açıklanması**

işisel bilgilerinizi yürürlükteki yasalara uygun olarak ve aşağıda belirtilen biçimlerin dahil olduğu şekillerde seçilmiş üçüncü taraflarla paylaşabiliriz:

Bu hizmet sağlayıcıların kişisel bilgilerin gizliliğini korumalarını talep ederiz.
* **Dağıtımcılar ve diğer güvenilir iş ortakları.** Kişisel bilgilerinizi ürünlerimizi dağıtan üçünü taraflarla veya diğer güvenilir iş ortaklarıyla söz konusu üçüncü tarafların size pazarlama iletileri göndermesine olanak sağlamayı içeren amaçlarla paylaşabiliriz. Kişisel bilgilerin pazarlama amacıyla bu şekilde paylaşılması yürürlükteki yasalara ve yönetmeliklere uygun olarak gerçekleştirilir.
* **İşlemlerle bağlantılı olarak ifşa.** Belirli işlemlerle bağlantılı olarak kişisel bilgilerinizin bir kısmını veya tamamını işlemin yerine getirilmesinde rol oynayan mali kuruluşlara, kamu tüzel kişiliklerine ve taşımacılık şirketlerine veya posta hizmetlerine ifşa edebiliriz.
* **Satın almalar veya elden çıkarmalarla bağlantılı ifşa.** Honeywell'in stratejik veya diğer ticari nedenlerle bazı ülkelerde işletmeleri satmaya, satın almaya, elden çıkarmaya, birleştirmeye veya başka bir şekilde yeniden düzenlemeye karar verdiği durumlar ortaya çıkabilir. Hakkınızda tuttuğumuz bilgileri bir birleşmenin pazarlıklarının sürmesi veya tamamlanması, Honeywell'in varlıklarının bir kısmının veya tamamının alınması, elden çıkarılması veya satılması için gereken makul düzeyde ifşa edebiliriz.
* **Başka nedenlerle ifşa.** Yasaların zorunlu kılması ya da izin vermesi veya yasal gereklere ya da hakkımızdaki yasal bir sürece uymak, haklarımızı ya da mal ve mülkümüzü korumak ve savunmak veya acil durumlarda herhangi bir kimsenin kişisel emniyetini korumak için bunun gerekli olduğuna art niyetsiz olarak kani olunması durumunda kişisel bilgileri ifşa edebiliriz.

**Uluslararası aktarımlar**

Honeywell küresel bir kuruluştur ve kişisel bilgileriniz yürürlükteki yasalara uygun olarak ABD, Meksika ve Hindistan gibi dünyanın çeşitli yerlerinde aktarılabilir, tutulabilir, saklanabilir veya kullanılabilir. Bu, kişisel bilgilerinizi topladığımızda, ülkenizin yasalarından farklı veri koruma yasalarına sahip olabilecek ülkelerde işlenebileceği anlamına gelir. Ancak Honeywell, gizliliğinizi korumak ve Avrupa Komisyonu'nun Standart Sözleşme Maddelerinin uygulanmasını da içeren ikamet ettiğiniz ülkeyle karşılaştırılabilir düzeyde kişisel bilgilerin korunmasını sağlamak için her zaman makul adımlar atacaktır. Kişisel bilgilerinizi korumaya yönelik uygun önlemler hakkında daha fazla bilgi için lütfen [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com) adresinden bizimle iletişime geçin.

* Benzer şekilde, kişisel bilgilerinizi sizin rızanızla toplamış ve işlemişsek, bu durumda **onayınızı istediğiniz zaman geri çekebilirsiniz**. Onayınızı geri çekmeniz, geri çekmenizden önce gerçekleştirdiğimiz herhangi bir işlemin yasallığını etkilemeyecek ve onay dışındaki yasal işleme gerekçelerine dayanarak yürütülen kişisel bilgilerinizin işlenmesini etkilemeyecektir.
* Kişisel bilgilerinizin satışını **devre dışı bırakma hakkına sahip olabilirsiniz**. Honeywell, kişisel bilgilerinizi kar amacıyla üçüncü taraflara satmaz. Ancak, bu Gizlilik Bildirimi ve [Çerez Bildirimimiz](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/cookie-notice#turkish) uyarınca kişisel bilgilerinizi üçüncü taraflarla paylaşır veya başka bir şekilde ifşa ederiz. Örneğin, ürünlerimizi dağıtmak, size teknik yardım sağlamak, web sitesi analitik araçlarını ve özelliklerini çalıştırmak ve ürün ve hizmetlerimizin pazarlanması ve satışını yapmak için üçüncü taraflarla etkileşime gireriz. Bu tür faaliyetler, kişisel bilgilerinizin üçüncü taraflara ifşa edilmesini içerebilir ve belirli (ancak hepsi olmamak üzere) veri koruma yasaları uyarınca verilerin "satışı" olarak değerlendirilebilir.
* Kişisel bilgilerinizin işlenmesinin veri koruma yasasına uygun olmadığını düşünüyorsanız, kişisel bilgilerinizi toplamamız ve kullanmamız hakkında yargı bölgenizdeki veri koruma yasasına uyumu denetlemekten sorumlu bir veri koruma yetkilisine **şikayette bulunma** hakkınız vardır. Örneğin, AEA'daki bireyler, yetkili Veri Koruma Kurumu'na şikayette bulunma hakkına sahiptir. Bunların listesine şuradan erişebilirsiniz: [https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members\_en](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en). Bununla birlikte, sorunlarınızın üzerine eğilmek istediğimizden, herhangi bir şikayetinizle ilgili olarak lütfen bizimle iletişime geçmekten çekinmeyin. Veri gizliliği haklarını kullandıkları için bireylere karşı ayrımcılık yapmayacağız.

Yürürlükteki yasalara uygun olarak, sizin için geçerli olan hakları kullanmanızı kolaylaştırırız. Bununla birlikte, kişisel bilgileriniz bir veri koruma yasası kapsamında koruma sağlamasa veya başka bir şekilde korunmasa bile, veri işleme faaliyetlerimizle ilgili olabilecek herhangi bir talep veya sorguyu yerine getirmeye çalışabiliriz. Haklarınızla ilgili sorularınız varsa veya haklarınızı kullanmak istiyorsanız, [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com) adresinden bizimle iletişime geçebilirsiniz veya aşağıdaki bağlantıdaki interaktif web formumuz aracılığıyla gizliliğe dair sorularınızı gönderebilirsiniz:

**Anonymizing information**

In accordance with applicable law, we may anonymize your personal information so that it can no longer be used to identify you. Anonymized information is not considered personal information and is therefore not subject to this Privacy Statement. We may collect, use, aggregate and share anonymized information for any purpose.

**How long we keep information**

The period during which we store your personal information varies depending on the purpose for the processing. For example, we store personal information needed to provide you with products and services, or to facilitate transactions you have requested, for so long as you are a customer of Honeywell or if you submit an employment application via our Sites, we will retain details of your application as set forth in the privacy notice made available to you in connection with your application or as otherwise required by law. In all other cases, we store your personal information for as long as is needed to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Statement, following which time it is either anonymized (where permitted by applicable law), deleted or destroyed.

* **Our group companies.** We may share your personal information with our affiliates and group companies as reasonably necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Statement.

Such sharing of personal information for marketing purposes will be performed in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
* **Disclosure in connection with transactions.** In connection with certain transactions, we may disclose some or all of your personal information to financial institutions, government entities and shipping companies or postal services involved in fulfilment of the transaction.
* **Disclosures in connection with acquisitions or divestitures.** Circumstances may arise where for strategic or other business reasons Honeywell decides to sell, buy, divest, merge or otherwise reorganize businesses in some countries. We may disclose information we maintain about you to the extent reasonably necessary to proceed with the negotiation or completion of a merger, acquisition, divestiture or sale of all or a portion of Honeywell’s assets.
* **Disclosure for other reasons.** We may disclose personal information if required or authorized to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with legal requirements or with legal process served on us, to protect and defend our rights or property or, in urgent circumstances, to protect the personal safety of any individual.

**International transfers**

Honeywell is a global organization and your personal information may be transferred to, held, stored or used across various locations worldwide such as the US, Mexico and India in accordance with applicable law. This means that when we collect your personal information it may be processed in countries that may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country. However, Honeywell will always take reasonable steps to protect your privacy and to provide a level of protection of personal information that is comparable to that of your country of residence which include implementing the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses. For more information on the appropriate safeguards in place to protect your personal information, please contact us at [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com).

**Biometric Data Policy (Illinois Residents Only)**

Honeywell may collect and use biometric data for health, safety, security, and other administrative functions, such as for performing wellness and health screening at our facilities, implementing timekeeping programs, implementing authentication and access controls with respect to Honeywell computers and other technology resources, and undertaking security measures, such as video surveillance with biometric-enabled features. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy Statement, it is Honeywell policy to retain biometric data for no longer than one (1) year following the last interaction between the applicable individual and us, provided however, we may retain such biometric data beyond this retention timeframe when permitted or otherwise required to comply with an applicable law, or a valid warrant, subpoena, or order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, or for Honeywell to establish, exercise, or defend against, legal claims so long as we retain such biometric data for the minimum time necessary in order to satisfy the same. Honeywell has implemented and maintains commercially reasonable protocols for permanently destroying, or disposing of, biometric data in a manner that will not intentionally compromise its confidentiality. For the avoidance of doubt, this paragraph does not, and is not intended to, abrogate the confidential nature of any internal Honeywell policy, procedure, or record related to the processing of biometric data or other personal data concerning a Honeywell employee, contractor, or temporary worker. This paragraph only applies to individuals who reside in Illinois, United States and furnish their biometric data to Honeywell.

* You may have the right to **opt-out of the sale of your personal information**. Honeywell does not sell your personal information to third parties for profit. However, we do share or otherwise disclose your personal information to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Statement and our [Cookie Notice](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/cookie-notice). For example, we engage with third parties to distribute our products, provide you with technical assistance, operate website analytical tools and features, and engage in marketing and sales of our products and services. Such activities may involve the disclosure of your personal information to third parties and may be considered a “sale” of data under certain (but not all) data protection laws.
* You have the right to **complain** to a data protection authority responsible for overseeing compliance with data protection law in your jurisdiction about our collection and use of your personal information if you believe our processing of your personal information does not comply with data protection law. For example, individuals in the EEA have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent Data Protection Authority, a list of which can be accessed at: [https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members\_en](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en).  We would however appreciate the chance to address your concerns, so please feel free to contact us regarding any complaint you may have.  We will not discriminate against individuals for exercising their data privacy rights.

* **Služby a transakce**. Vaše osobní údaje používáme k poskytování služeb nebo provádění požadovaných transakcí. Může se jednat například (ale nikoli výlučně) o poskytnutí informací o zakoupených nebo jinak používaných produktech či službách naší společnosti, registraci zakoupených produktů, zpracování objednávek produktů, vyřizování reklamací, poskytování náhradních příruček k produktům, vyřizování vašich požadavků v rámci služeb zákazníkům nebo o používání našich webů.

* **Marketing**. Podle platné legislativy a předpisů smíme používat vaše osobní údaje, abychom vás informovali o produktech nebo službách, které vás mohou zajímat, nebo s vámi jiným způsobem komunikovali o našich nabídkách, událostech a novinkách, průzkumech, speciálních nabídkách a souvisejících tématech. Marketingovou komunikaci zasílanou e-mailem můžete kdykoli bezplatně zrušit, když použijete odkaz pro zrušení odběru v kterémkoli z e-mailových marketingových materiálů, které od nás dostáváte, nebo když se na nás obrátíte prostřednictvím kontaktních údajů uvedených v tomto prohlášení. S ohledem na zemi vašeho pobytu můžete mít možnost odhlásit se z jiných typů marketingové komunikace. Máte-li zájem o více informací, kontaktujte nás s využitím kontaktních údajů uvedených v tomto Prohlášení o ochraně soukromí. V některých jurisdikcích náleží fyzickým osobám (např. obyvatelům Kalifornie) právo požadovat určité informace týkající se toho, jak sdělujeme osobní údaje třetím stranám pro účely přímého marketingu třetích stran. Chcete-li získat další informace o našich praktikách při poskytování údajů pro marketingové účely, kontaktujte nás v souladu s níže uvedenými pokyny.
* **Zájmově orientovaná reklama**. Shromažďujeme údaje o vašich online aktivitách a identifikujeme vaše zájmy, abychom vám mohli poskytovat nejrelevantnější reklamu.

* **Finanční pobídkové a věrnostní programy**. Shromažďujeme a používáme osobní údaje k udržování a správě finančních pobídkových a věrnostních programů. Osobní údaje, které poskytujete v rámci těchto programů, využíváme k tomu, abychom vám nabízeli jedinečné odměny, sledovali váš stav v programu a umožnili výměnu programových bodů za produkty, propagační materiály, školicí semináře a další položky. V míře, do jaké to připouští zákon, můžeme také využít jakékoli osobní údaje, které nám poskytnete ve spojitosti s programem finančních pobídek, k jakémukoli jinému účelu uvedenému v tomto Prohlášení o ochraně soukromí. Prostudujte si podmínky každého finančního pobídkového programu, do něhož se chcete zaregistrovat nebo jehož se chcete účastnit, protože takové podmínky mohou být speciálně přizpůsobeny příslušnému programu.

My a další členové naší skupiny můžeme tyto informace použít za účelem zvážení uzavření pracovního poměru, ověření vaší spolehlivosti či způsobilosti k výkonu práce, případně jak se uvádí jinak v jakémkoli samostatném prohlášení o ochraně soukromí nebo v jiném prohlášení, jež vám bude poskytnuto v souvislosti s vaší žádostí. K získávání, shromažďování a uchovávání žádostí o zaměstnání můžeme využívat třetí stranu (např. firmu zabývající se náborem pracovníků) nebo platformu sociálních médií. Další informace najdete v našem [Prohlášení o ochraně soukromí uchazečů o zaměstnání](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/applicant-privacy-notice#czech).
* **Průzkumy a analýzy**. Vaše osobní údaje můžeme používat k průzkumům a analýzám, které nám pomáhají analyzovat vaše nákupní preference, identifikovat produkty a služby, které nejlépe vyhovují vašim požadavkům, a měřit účinnost zobrazované reklamy.
* **Vynucování práva**. Shromažďované osobní údaje můžeme používat k odhalování, prevenci a řešení podvodů, porušování duševního vlastnictví, našich podmínek a ujednání, porušování zákona nebo jiného zneužití našich webů.

Pokud to zákon dovoluje, můžeme údaje shromažďované prostřednictvím našich webů spojovat s ostatními údaji, které o vás evidujeme (například s údaji o používání našich produktů a služeb), abychom vám nabídli dokonalejší a jednotnější prostředí určené ke spolupráci se zákazníky nebo k jiným účelům uvedeným v tomto prohlášení.

**Právní základ zpracování vašich údajů**

Pokud to vyžaduje zákon, zajistíme, aby zpracování vašich osobních údajů mělo právní základ. Ve většině případů bude právní základ záviset na příslušných osobních údajích a konkrétním kontextu, v němž je shromažďujeme.

* **Smlouva**: zpracování je nezbytné pro provádění služeb, jež vám poskytujeme, nebo za účelem realizace kroků (na vaši žádost) před provedením těchto služeb nebo v jejich očekávání.
* **Zákonná povinnost**: zpracování musíme provádět, abychom dostáli svým právním povinnostem, včetně dodržování platné legislativy, předpisů, státních a jiných obdobných požadavků, soudních rozhodnutí nebo předvolání.
* **Souhlas**: zpracování vychází z vašeho souhlasu se zpracováním osobních údajů k jednomu nebo více konkrétním účelům (např. marketing).
* **Oprávněné zájmy**: zpracování je nutné, protože na něm máme oprávněný zájem, například kvůli vývoji a zdokonalování našich webů, produktů nebo služeb k prospěchu našich zákazníků.
* **Životně důležité zájmy**: zpracování je nezbytné kvůli ochraně vašich životně důležitých zájmů (například ze zdravotních a bezpečnostních důvodů, pokud se zúčastníte schůzky na pracovišti společnosti Honeywell).

Pokud máte jakékoli dotazy nebo potřebujete další informace týkající se právního základu pro shromažďování a používání vašich osobních údajů, zašlete e-mail na adresu [HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com)

**Anonymizace údajů**

V souladu s platnou legislativou můžeme vaše osobní údaje anonymizovat, aby nebylo možné vás podle nich identifikovat. Anonymizované údaje se nepovažují za osobní údaje, a proto se na ně toto prohlášení nevztahuje. Anonymizované údaje můžeme shromažďovat, používat, agregovat a sdílet k jakýmkoli účelům.

**Jak dlouho údaje uchováváme**

Doba uložení vašich osobních údajů se liší podle účelu jejich zpracování. Například uchováváme osobní údaje potřebné k tomu, abychom vám mohli poskytovat produkty a služby nebo abychom mohli realizovat vámi požadované transakce, jste-li zákazníkem společnosti Honeywell nebo žádáte-li o zaměstnání prostřednictvím našich webů. V takovém případě budeme údaje z vaší žádosti uchovávat po takovou dobu, jak se uvádí v prohlášení o ochraně soukromí, jež vám je poskytnuto ve spojení s žádostí, případně jak to vyžaduje zákon. V ostatních případech uchováváme vaše osobní údaje tak dlouho, dokud jsou potřeba ke splnění účelu uvedeného v tomto prohlášení. Po uplynutí takové doby budou údaje anonymizovány (pokud to vyžaduje platná legislativa), odstraněny nebo zničeny.

**Sdělování údajů**

Podle platné legislativy smíme vaše osobní údaje sdílet s vybranými třetími stranami. Týká se to těchto třetích stran:

* **Poskytovatelé služeb**. Vaše osobní údaje můžeme sdílet se společnostmi, se kterými máme uzavřenou smlouvu o poskytování služeb naším jménem, jako je například hostování webů, provádění průzkumů, zpracování transakcí, analýza našich webů a další analýzy, které zvyšují kvalitu naší obchodní činnosti, webů, produktů a služeb. Od poskytovatelů služeb vyžadujeme, aby vaše osobní údaje chránili jako důvěrné.
* **Distributoři a jiní důvěryhodní obchodní partneři**. Vaše osobní údaje můžeme sdílet s třetími stranami, které distribuují naše produkty, a s dalšími důvěryhodnými obchodními partnery, abychom jim umožnili například posílat vám marketingové materiály. Sdílení osobních údajů k marketingovým účelům probíhá podle platné legislativy a předpisů.
* **Sdělování údajů ve spojitosti s transakcemi**. V souvislosti s určitými transakcemi můžeme sdělit některé nebo všechny vaše osobní údaje finančním institucím, státním úřadům a přepravním nebo poštovním společnostem, které se podílejí na uskutečnění transakce.
* **Sdělení údajů ve spojitosti s akvizicemi nebo odprodejem**. Mohou nastat okolnosti, kdy se společnost Honeywell ze strategických nebo jiných obchodních důvodů rozhodne v některých zemích prodat, koupit, odprodat, sloučit nebo jinak reorganizovat své podniky. Informace, které si o vás udržujeme, můžeme zpřístupnit do míry přiměřeně nezbytné k vyjednávání nebo provedení fúze, akvizice, odprodeje či prodeje části nebo veškerého majetku společnosti Honeywell.
* **Sdělení údajů z jiných důvodů**. Osobní údaje můžeme sdělit jiné straně, pokud to vyžaduje zákon (nebo nás k tomu opravňuje) nebo tak učiníme v dobré víře, že je to nutné ke splnění zákonných požadavků nebo kvůli dodržení právního procesu uplatňovaného vůči nám, dále k ochraně a obraně našich práv nebo majetku, v naléhavých případech a kvůli ochraně bezpečí osob.

**Mezinárodní přenosy**

Společnost Honeywell je globální organizace a vaše osobní údaje mohou být v souladu s platnou legislativou přenášeny, drženy, uchovávány nebo používány na různých místech po celém světě, například v USA, Mexiku a Indii. To znamená, že když shromažďujeme vaše osobní údaje, mohou být zpracovány v zemích, kde platí zákony na ochranu údajů, které se liší od zákonů vaší země. Společnost Honeywell však vždy přijme přiměřená opatření k ochraně vašeho soukromí a k zajištění úrovně ochrany osobních údajů, která je srovnatelná s úrovní vaší země pobytu, včetně implementace standardních smluvních doložek Evropské komise. Máte-li zájem o další informace o příslušných opatřeních na ochranu vašich osobních údajů, kontaktujte nás na adrese [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com).

**Vaše práva**

S ohledem na příslušnou legislativu můžete mít v souvislosti se svými osobními údaji určitá práva.

* Můžete mít právo požadovat, **aby se o vás nerozhodovalo pouze na základě automatického zpracování, včetně profilování**, pokud má takové rozhodnutí na vás právní dopady nebo se vás významně dotýká.
* Pokud shromažďujeme a zpracováváme vaše osobní údaje na základě uděleného souhlasu, **můžete svůj souhlas kdykoli odvolat**. Odvolání souhlasu nebude mít vliv na zákonnost jakéhokoli zpracování, které jsme provedli před odvoláním, ani to nebude mít vliv na zpracování vašich osobních údajů prováděné na základě jiných zákonných důvodů zpracování, než je souhlas.
* Můžete mít právo **odhlásit se z prodeje osobních údajů**. Společnost Honeywell neprodává vaše osobní údaje třetím stranám za účelem zisku. Vaše osobní údaje však sdílíme nebo jinak poskytujeme třetím stranám v souladu s tímto Prohlášením o ochraně soukromí a s naším [Prohlášením o používání souborů cookie](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/cookie-notice#czech). Spolupracujeme například s třetími stranami při distribuci našich produktů, poskytování technické pomoci, používání analytických nástrojů a funkcí webů a při marketingových aktivitách a prodeji našich produktů a služeb. Takové aktivity mohou zahrnovat poskytnutí osobních údajů třetím stranám a podle některých (nikoli však všech) zákonů na ochranu osobních údajů mohou být považovány za „prodej“ údajů.
* Máte právo **vznést stížnost** úřadu pro ochranu údajů odpovědnému za dohled nad dodržováním zákonů o ochraně údajů ve vaší jurisdikci s ohledem na shromažďování a využívání vašich osobních údajů z naší strany, pokud se domníváte, že naše zpracování vašich osobních údajů není v souladu s právními předpisy o ochraně osobních údajů. Například fyzické osoby v EHP mají právo stěžovat si příslušnému úřadu pro ochranu údajů, jejichž seznam je k dispozici na adrese: [https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members\_en](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en). Velice bychom ocenili, kdybyste nám dali příležitost problém vyřešit, a proto nás prosím v případě jakýchkoli stížností neváhejte kontaktovat. Nebudeme žádné fyzické osoby diskriminovat za to, že uplatňují svá práva na ochranu osobních údajů.

Uplatňování vašich práv zajistíme podle platné legislativy. I v případě, že vaše osobní údaje nejsou chráněny podle zákona o ochraně osobních údajů nebo se na ně tyto zákony jinak nevztahují, můžeme se pokusit vyhovět jakýmkoli požadavkům nebo dotazům, které můžete mít v souvislosti s našimi činnostmi v oblasti zpracování údajů.

Vi vil altid respektere de juridiske rettigheder, du måtte have for at forhindre os i at gøre dette. Data, der indsamles på denne måde omfatter:

Find oplysninger om cookies og andre lignende sporingsteknologier, som vi bruger på vores sider i vores [cookieeklæring](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/cookie-notice#danish).

* **Geo-placeringsoplysninger**. For visse sider, med dit samtykke, kan vi indsamle den præcise placering i realtid (dvs. geo-placering) for din mobile enhed. Disse oplysninger vil kun blive brugt til din brug af siderne, herunder af vores tjenesteleverandører, der kan behandle disse oplysninger i forbindelse med leveringen af tjenester på vegne af os. Hvis disse oplysninger gives, kan du ændre dette samtykke ved at administrere dine indstillinger for placeringstjenester via indstillingerne på din mobile enhed.
* **Oplysninger, der indsamles af tredjeparter**. I overensstemmelse med gældende lovgivning kan vi indsamle personlige oplysninger om dig fra tredjeparter, såsom sociale medier og applikationer, og kombinere dem med oplysninger, vi allerede har, for at hjælpe os med at forbedre og tilpasse vores sider til dine indstillinger og til andre formål, der er angivet i denne databeskyttelseserklæring. Vi kan også indsamle dine forretningskontaktoplysninger fra din arbejdsgiver eller andre tredjeparter for at muliggøre eller på anden måde engagere os i traditionelle forretningsaktiviteter og lignende administrative anliggender.

**Vores brug af oplysninger**

Vi kan bruge de personlige oplysninger, der indsamles via vores sider, eller når du kontakter os, til formål, der omfatter:

* **Forretningskontaktdata**. Honeywell indsamler og bruger forretningskontaktdata til at udføre kommunikation eller transaktioner, herunder til at udføre due diligence vedrørende, eller ved levering eller modtagelse af, et produkt eller en tjeneste. Honeywell kan for eksempel indsamle og bruge disse forretningskontaktoplysninger til at muliggøre og administrere ordrer, kontrakter, garantier, vedligeholdelse og lignende forretningsfunktioner med henblik på kreditanalyse og opkrævning, for at hjælpe vores egen interne overholdelse og juridiske krav og (om nødvendigt) til at forsvare vores interesser og krav.
* **Tjenester og transaktioner**. Vi kan bruge dine personlige oplysninger til at levere tjenester til dig eller udføre transaktioner, du har anmodet om, herunder, men ikke begrænset til, at levere oplysninger om virksomhedens produkter eller tjenester, som du har købt eller på anden måde bruger, registrere købte produkter, behandle produktordrer, håndtere garantikrav, udskifte produktmanualer, besvare kundeserviceanmodninger og muliggøre brugen af vores sider.
* **Administration og beskyttelse af vores forretning og sider**. Vi kan bruge dine personlige oplysninger til at administrere og beskytte vores virksomhed og vores sider, herunder til fejlfinding, systemvedligeholdelse, support, rapportering og datahosting.
* **Forbedring af vores forretning, sider, produkter og tjenester**. Vi kan bruge dine personlige oplysninger til at udføre forretningsanalyser eller til andre formål, der hjælper os med at udvikle og forbedre kvaliteten af vores forretning, sider, produkter og tjenester (herunder nye produkter og tjenester), f.eks. ved at tilpasse vores sider til dine specifikke indstillinger eller interesser.
* **Markedsføring**. I overensstemmelse med gældende love og bestemmelser kan vi bruge dine personlige oplysninger til at informere dig om produkter eller tjenester, der kan være af interesse for dig, og til på anden måde at kommunikere med dig om tilbud, begivenheder og nyheder, undersøgelser, særtilbud og relaterede emner. Du kan til enhver tid framelde dig markedsføringskommunikation, der sendes via e-mail gratis ved brug af linket »frameld« i det e-mailmarkedsføringsmateriale, du modtager fra os, eller ved at kontakte os gennem de kontaktoplysninger, der er angivet i denne databeskyttelseserklæring. Afhængigt af dit bopælsland kan du også fravælge andre former for markedsføringskommunikation; kontakt os ved hjælp af kontaktoplysningerne i databeskyttelseserklæringen for flere oplysninger. Nogle jurisdiktioner giver enkeltpersoner (f.eks. beboere i Californien) ret til at anmode om visse oplysninger vedrørende vores videregivelse af personoplysninger til tredjeparter, der bruges til tredjepartens direkte markedsføringsformål. Du kan få flere oplysninger om vores praksis for videregivelse af data til markedsføringsformål ved at kontakte os i overensstemmelse med instruktionerne nedenfor.
* **Interessebaseret annoncering**. Vi indsamler data om dine onlineaktiviteter og identificerer dine interesser, så vi kan levere de annoncer, der er mest relevante for dig. Du kan fravælge at modtage interessebaseret annoncering fra Honeywell i henhold til beskrivelsen i vores [cookieerklæring](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/cookie-notice#danish).
* **Finansielle incitamenter og loyalitetsprogrammer**. Vi indsamler og bruger personlige oplysninger til at vedligeholde og administrere vores økonomiske incitaments- og loyalitetsprogrammer. Vi bruger de personlige oplysninger, du giver i disse programmer, til at tilbyde unikke belønninger, spore din programstatus og til at muliggøre udvekslingen af programpoint for produkter, reklamemateriale, træningsworkshops og andre ting. I det omfang loven tillader det, kan vi også bruge personlige oplysninger, som du giver i forbindelse med et økonomisk incitamentsprogram, til andre formål, der er angivet i denne databeskyttelseserklæring. Gennemgå vilkårene og betingelserne for hvert økonomisk incitamentsprogram, som du ønsker at tilmelde dig eller deltage i, da sådanne vilkår og betingelser kan være svært skræddersyede til det relevante program. Hvis du accepterer at deltage i disse programmer, kan du til enhver tid trække samtykket tilbage ved at kontakte os ved hjælp af kontaktoplysningerne i bunden af denne databeskyttelseserklæring eller i overensstemmelse med instruktionerne i de gældende vilkår og betingelser for programmet.
* **Jobansøgninger**. I forbindelse med en jobansøgning eller forespørgsel kan du give os oplysninger om dig selv, såsom et CV/curriculum vitae, faglige referencer, oplysninger om uddannelse og jobbaggrund, samt oplysninger om faglig uddannelse og certificeringer. Vi og medlemmer af vores koncern kan bruge disse oplysninger med henblik på ansættelsesovervejelser, baggrundstjek og ansættelsesberettigelse, og som ellers angivet i en separat databeskyttelseserklæring eller anden erklæring, der stilles til rådighed i forbindelse med din ansøgning. Vi kan bruge en tredjepart (f.eks. en rekrutteringsagent) eller en social medieplatform til at anmode om, indsamle og opbevare ansættelsesansøgninger. Du kan få flere oplysninger ved at læse vores [databeskyttelseserklæring for ansøgere](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/applicant-privacy-notice#danish).
* **Forskning og analyse**. Vi kan bruge dine personlige oplysninger til at udføre forskning og analyse for at hjælpe os med at analysere dine købspræferencer, identificere de produkter og tjenester, der bedst opfylder dine krav, og til at måle effektiviteten af den annoncering, vi viser for dig.
* **Håndhævelse**: Vi kan bruge de personlige oplysninger, vi indsamler, til at detektere, forhindre og reagere på svindel, brud på intellektuel ejendomsret, brud på vores vilkår og betingelser, brud på loven eller anden misbrug af vores sider.

Når det er tilladt ved lov, kan vi kombinere de oplysninger, vi indsamler via vores sider, med andre oplysninger, vi har om dig (såsom oplysninger om din brug af vores produkter og tjenester) for at tilbyde dig en forbedret og konsekvent kundeoplevelse, når du interagerer med os eller til andre formål, der er angivet i denne databeskyttelseserklæring.

**Det juridiske grundlag, hvorpå vi behandler oplysninger**

Når loven kræver det, vil vi sikre, at der er et retsgrundlag for behandlingen af dine personlige oplysninger. I de fleste tilfælde vil vores retsgrundlag afhænge af de pågældende personlige oplysninger og den specifikke kontekst, hvortil vi indsamler dem.

* **Kontrakt**: behandlingen er nødvendig for udførelsen af de tjenester, vi leverer til dig, eller for at tage skridt (efter din anmodning) forud for og i forventning om udførelsen af sådanne tjenester;
* **Juridisk forpligtelse**: behandlingen er nødvendig for at overholde vores juridiske forpligtelser, herunder overholdelse af gældende love, bestemmelser, statslige og kvasi-statslige anmodninger, retskendelser eller stævninger;
* **Samtykke**: behandlingen er baseret på dit samtykke til behandlingen af dine personlige oplysninger til et eller flere specifikke formål (f.eks. markedsføring);
* **Legitime interesser**: behandlingen er nødvendig for at opfylde vores legitime interesser, for eksempel for at udvikle og forbedre vores sider, produkter og/eller tjenester til gavn for vores kunder; eller
* **Vitale interesser**: behandlingen er nødvendig for at beskytte dine vitale interesser (f.eks. af sundheds- og sikkerhedsmæssige årsager, hvis du deltager i et møde på en Honeywell-lokation).

Hvis du har spørgsmål eller brug for yderligere oplysninger vedrørende det retsgrundlag, hvorpå vi indsamler og bruger dine personlige oplysninger, bedes du sende en e-mail til [HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com)

**Anonymisering af oplysninger**

I overensstemmelse med gældende lovgivning kan vi anonymisere dine personlige oplysninger, så de ikke længere kan bruges til at identificere dig. Anonymiserede oplysninger betragtes ikke som personlige oplysninger og er derfor ikke underlagt denne databeskyttelseserklæring. Vi kan indsamle, bruge, sammenlægge og dele anonymiserede oplysninger til ethvert formål.

**Opbevaringstiden for oplysninger**

Den periode, hvor vi gemmer dine personlige oplysninger, varierer afhængigt af formålet med behandlingen. For eksempel gemmer vi personlige oplysninger, der er nødvendige for at levere produkter og tjenester til dig, eller for at muliggøre transaktioner, du har anmodet om, så længe du er kunde hos Honeywell; eller hvis du indsender en jobansøgning via vores sider, vil vi opbevare oplysninger om din ansøgning som angivet i den databeskyttelseserklæring, der er gjort tilgængelig for dig i forbindelse med din ansøgning, eller som på anden måde krævet af loven. I alle andre tilfælde gemmer vi dine personlige oplysninger, så længe det er nødvendigt for at opfylde de formål, der er beskrevet i denne databeskyttelseserklæring, hvorefter de enten anonymiseres (hvor det er tilladt i henhold til gældende lovgivning), slettes eller destrueres.

**Videregivelse af oplysninger**

Vi kan dele dine personlige oplysninger med udvalgte tredjeparter i overensstemmelse med gældende lovgivning, herunder som angivet nedenfor:

* **Vores koncernselskaber**. Vi kan dele dine personlige oplysninger med vores datterselskaber og koncernselskaber, hvis det med rimelighed er nødvendigt til de formål, der er angivet i denne databeskyttelseserklæring.
* **Tjenesteleverandører**. Vi kan dele dine personlige oplysninger med virksomheder, som vi har indgået kontrakt med omkring levering tjenester på vegne af os, såsom hosting af hjemmesider, udførelse af undersøgelser, behandling af transaktioner, analyse af vores sider og udførelse af analyser for at forbedre kvaliteten af vores forretning, sider, produkter og tjenester. Vi kræver, at disse tjenesteleverandører beskytter fortroligheden af dine personlige oplysninger.
* **Distributører og andre betroede forretningspartnere**. Vi kan dele dine personlige oplysninger med tredjeparter, der distribuerer vores produkter og andre betroede forretningspartnere til formål, der omfatter at tillade disse tredjeparter at sende markedsføringskommunikation til dig. En sådan deling af personlige oplysninger til markedsføringsformål vil blive udført i overensstemmelse med gældende love og bestemmelser.
* **Oplysninger i forbindelse med transaktioner**. I forbindelse med visse transaktioner kan vi videregive nogle eller alle dine personlige oplysninger til finansielle institutioner, offentlige enheder og fragtvirksomheder eller posttjenester, der er involveret i gennemførelsen af transaktionen.
* **Oplysninger i forbindelse med erhvervelser eller afhændelser**. Der kan opstå omstændigheder, hvor Honeywell af strategiske eller andre forretningsmæssige årsager beslutter at sælge, købe, afhænde, fusionere eller på anden måde omorganisere virksomheder i nogle lande. Vi kan videregive oplysninger, vi opbevarer om dig, i det omfang det med rimelighed er nødvendigt for at fortsætte med forhandlingen eller gennemførelsen af en fusion, erhvervelse, afhændelse eller salg af alle eller en del af Honeywells aktiver.
* **Videregivelse af andre grunde**. Vi kan videregive personoplysninger, hvis det er påkrævet eller autoriseret i henhold til loven eller i god tro om, at en sådan handling er nødvendig for at overholde de juridiske krav eller den juridiske proces, der gælder for os, for at beskytte og forsvare vores rettigheder eller ejendom eller, i hastetilfælde, for at beskytte den enkeltes personlige sikkerhed.

**Internationale overførsler**

Honeywell er en global organisation, og dine personlige oplysninger kan overføres til, opbevares, lagres eller bruges på tværs af forskellige steder over hele verden, såsom USA, Mexico og Indien, i overensstemmelse med gældende lovgivning. Det betyder, at når vi indsamler dine personlige oplysninger, kan de blive behandlet i lande, der kan have databeskyttelseslove, der er forskellige fra lovene i dit land. Honeywell vil dog altid træffe rimelige foranstaltninger for at beskytte dine data og for at sikre et beskyttelsesniveau for personlige oplysninger, der kan sammenlignes med niveauet i dit bopælsland, herunder implementering af Europa-Kommissionens standardkontraktklausuler. Du kan få flere oplysninger om de passende sikkerhedsforanstaltninger omkring beskyttelse af personlige oplysninger ved at kontakte os på [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com).

**Sikkerhed**

Vi er dedikerede til at beskytte dine personlige oplysninger. Vi bruger tekniske og organisatoriske foranstaltninger til at levere et sikkerhedsniveau, der er passende i forhold til risikoen for at behandle dine personlige oplysninger. Du kan få flere oplysninger om, hvordan Honeywell beskytter dine personlige oplysninger, ved at kontakte os på [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com)

**Dine rettigheder**

Afhængigt af gældende lovgivning, kan du have visse rettigheder med hensyn til dine personlige oplysninger.

* Du har muligvis ret til at **tilgå, rette, opdatere** eller **anmode om sletning** af dine personlige oplysninger.
* Du kan **modsige** behandlingen af dine personlige oplysninger, bede os om at **begrænse**behandling af dine personlige oplysninger eller anmode om **flytning** af dine personlige oplysninger.
* Du kan have ret **til ikke at få truffet en beslutning om dig, der udelukkende er baseret på automatiseret behandling, herunder profilering,** hvis denne beslutning har juridisk effekt omkring dig eller påvirker dig i væsentlig grad.
* Similarly, if we have indsamlet and proces dit personal information with dit consent, then **du kan når som helst trække dit samtykke tilbage**. Tilbagetrækning af dit samtykke vil ikke påvirke lovligheden af enhver behandling, vi foretog før din tilbagetrækning, og det vil heller ikke påvirke behandlingen af dine personlige oplysninger, der udføres under andre lovlige behandlingsgrunde end samtykket.
* Du kan have retten til **at fravælge salg af dine personlige oplysninger**. Honeywell sælger ikke dine personlige oplysninger til tredjeparter med fortjeneste for øje. Vi deler eller videregiver dog på anden måde dine personlige oplysninger til tredjeparter i overensstemmelse med denne databeskyttelseserklæring og vores [cookieerklæring](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/cookie-notice#danish). Vi samarbejder eksempelvis med tredjeparter om at distribuere vores produkter, give dig teknisk hjælp, drive hjemmesideanalytiske værktøjer og funktioner, og udføre markedsføring og salg af vores produkter og tjenester. Sådanne aktiviteter kan indebære videregivelse af dine personlige oplysninger til tredjeparter og kan betragtes som et »salg« af data i henhold til visse (men ikke alle) databeskyttelseslove.
* Du kan have ret til at **klage** til en databeskyttelsesmyndighed, der er ansvarlig for at overvåge overholdelse af databeskyttelseslovgivningen i din jurisdiktion om vores indsamling og brug af dine personlige oplysninger, hvis du mener, at vores behandling af dine personlige oplysninger ikke er i overensstemmelse med databeskyttelseslovgivningen. Personer i EØS har f.eks. ret til at indgive en klage til den kompetente databeskyttelsesmyndighed, som du kan få en liste over på: [https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members\_en](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en). Vi vil dog sætte pris på muligheden for at løse dine problemer, så du er velkommen til at kontakte os vedrørende eventuelle klager, du måtte have. Vi vil ikke diskriminere mod enkeltpersoner, der udøver deres databeskyttelsesrettigheder.

Vi vil muliggøre din udøvelse af de rettigheder, der gælder for dig i overensstemmelse med gældende lovgivning. Men selvom dine personoplysninger ikke er beskyttet i henhold til, eller på anden måde er underlagt, en databeskyttelseslov, kan vi forsøge at imødekomme enhver anmodning eller forespørgsel, du måtte have i forbindelse med vores databehandlingsaktiviteter. Hvis du har spørgsmål om dine rettigheder eller ønsker at udøve dem, kan du kontakte os på [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com) eller indsende spørgsmål om databeskyttelse via vores interaktive webformular på følgende link:

[https://honeywellhub.secure.force.com/](https://honeywellhub.secure.force.com/PrivacyInformationRequestForm?lang=en)

**Børns oplysninger**

Vores sider er ikke rettet mod og bør ikke bruges af børn under seksten år (16), og vi indsamler, bruger eller sælger ikke bevidst oplysninger fra sådanne personer. Hvis du er mindreårig, som forstået i henhold til lovgivningen i dit land, må du ikke indsende personoplysninger via vores sider.

**Links til andre hjemmesider**

Vores sider kan indeholde links til tredjeparters hjemmesider, produkter og tjenester. Vi påtager os intet ansvar for disse hjemmesider, produkter og tjenester, deres politikker eller deres indsamling eller anden behandling af dine personlige oplysninger. Disse tredjeparters praksis er underlagt deres egne databeskyttelsespolitikker. Vi opfordrer dig til at læse disse tredjeparters databeskyttelsespolitikker.

**Kontakt os**

Hvis du har spørgsmål vedrørende denne databeskyttelseserklæring eller vores håndtering af dine personlige oplysninger, ønsker at indgive en klage, eller ønsker at kontakte vores databeskyttelsesansvarlige, bedes du kontakte os ved hjælp af nedenstående kontaktoplysninger. Vi vil straks håndtere din bekymring og bestræbe os på at nå frem til en tilfredsstillende løsning.

Varmistamme lain niin vaatiessa, että henkilötietojesi käsittelylle on oikeusperuste. Useimmissa tapauksissa oikeusperuste riippuu kerätyistä henkilötiedoista ja keruun kontekstista.

* **Sopimusperuste**: käsittely on välttämätöntä, jotta voimme suorittaa sinulle tarjoamamme palvelut tai toimet, joita vaaditaan (pyynnöstäsi) ennen palvelujen suorittamista niihin valmistautumiseksi
* **Laillinen velvoite**: käsittely on välttämätöntä, jotta voimme täyttää lakisääteiset velvoitteemme, kuten sovellettavien lakien, asetusten, viranomaisen tai viranomaistehtävää hoitavan yksityisen yrityksen vaatimusten tai oikeuden määräysten tai haasteiden noudattamiseksi
* **Suostumusperuste**: käsittely perustuu henkilötietojesi käsittelyyn antamaasi suostumukseen yhtä tai useampaa nimettyä tarkoitusta (esim. markkinointia) varten
* **Oikeutetut edut**: käsittely on välttämätöntä oikeutetun etumme toteuttamiseksi, kuten Sivustojemme, tuotteidemme ja/tai palveluidemme kehittämiseksi ja parantamiseksi asiakkaidemme hyväksi
* **Elintärkeät edut**: käsittely on välttämätöntä elintärkeän etusi suojaamiseksi (esimerkiksi terveys- ja turvallisuussyistä, jos osallistut tapaamiseen Honeywellin toimipisteessä).

Jos sinulla on kysyttävää tai haluat lisätietoja oikeusperusteesta, jonka nojalla keräämme ja käytämme henkilötietojasi, lähetä sähköpostia osoitteeseen [HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com)

**Tietojen anonymisointi**

Saatamme anonymisoida henkilötietojasi sovellettavan lain sallimissa rajoissa siten, ettei sinua voida enää tunnistaa kyseisten tietojen perusteella. Anonymisoitujen tietojen ei katsota olevan henkilötietoja, eikä niihin sen vuoksi sovelleta tätä Tietosuojalausuntoa. Voimme kerätä, käyttää, koostaa ja jakaa anonymisoituja tietoja missä tahansa tarkoituksessa.

**Kauanko tietoja säilytetään**

Henkilötietojesi säilytysaika vaihtelee sen mukaan, missä tarkoituksessa niitä käsitellään. Säilytämme esimerkiksi tuotteiden ja palvelujen tarjoamiseen tai pyytämiesi transaktioiden mahdollistamiseen tarvittavia henkilötietoja niin kauan kuin olet Honeywellin asiakas. Jos lähetät työhakemuksen Sivustojemme kautta, säilytämme hakemuksesi tietoja sinulle haun yhteydessä annetun tietosuojailmoituksen tai lain vaatimusten mukaisesti. Kaikissa muissa tapauksissa henkilötietojasi säilytetään niin kauan kuin se on tarpeen tässä Tietosuojalausunnossa määriteltyjen tarkoitusten toteuttamiseksi, minkä jälkeen ne joko anonymisoidaan (sovellettavan lain sen salliessa), poistetaan tai tuhotaan.

**Tietojen luovuttaminen**

Saatamme luovuttaa henkilötietojasi valituille kolmansille osapuolille sovellettavan lain sallimissa rajoissa muun muassa seuraavasti.

* **Konserniyhtiömme**. Voimme luovuttaa henkilötietojasi tytäryhtiöillemme ja konserniyhtiöillemme, kun se katsotaan kohtuudella välttämättömäksi tähän Tietosuojalausuntoon kirjattua tarkoitusta varten.
* **Palveluntuottajat**. Voimme luovuttaa henkilötietojasi yrityksille, jotka toimeksiannostamme tuottavat palveluita, kuten ylläpitävät verkkosivustojamme, suorittavat kyselyitä, käsittelevät transaktioita, analysoivat Sivustojamme ja suorittavat analyyseja liiketoimintamme, Sivustojemme ja tuotteidemme ja palveluidemme laadun parantamiseksi. Edellytämme, että nämä palveluntuottajat pitävät henkilötietosi salassa.
* **Jakelijat ja muut luotetut liiketoimintakumppanit**. Voimme luovuttaa henkilötietojasi kolmansille osapuolille, jotka jakelevat tuotteitamme, ja muille luotetuille liiketoimintakumppaneillemme muun muassa siinä tarkoituksessa, että kyseiset kolmannet osapuolet voivat lähettää sinulle markkinointiviestejä. Markkinointitarkoituksiin henkilötietoja luovutetaan sovellettavien lakien ja määräysten puitteissa.
* **Transaktioihin liittyvä tietojen luovuttaminen**. Joidenkin tapahtumien yhteydessä saatamme luovuttaa kaikki tai osan meillä olevista henkilötiedoistasi rahoituslaitoksille, viranomaisille ja kuljetusyrityksille tai postipalveluille, jotka osallistuvat transaktion toteutukseen.
* **Yritysostoon tai myyntiin liittyvä tietojen luovuttaminen**. Strategisista tai muista liiketoiminnallisista syistä Honeywell saattaa päätyä myymään, ostamaan, divestoimaan, yhdistämään tai uudelleenorganisoimaan yritystoimintaa joissakin maissa. Honeywell voi luovuttaa asiakastietoja kohtuudella tarpeellisessa määrin fuusioitumista, yritysostoa tai myyntiä tai yritystoimintojen osittaista tai täysimääräistä myyntiä koskevien neuvottelujen jatkamiseksi tai loppuunsaattamiseksi.
* **Tietojen luovuttaminen muista syistä**. Voimme luovuttaa henkilötietoja oikeuksiemme tai omaisuutemme suojaamiseksi ja puolustamiseksi tai hätätilanteessa henkilön turvallisuuden suojaamiseksi, mikäli laki sitä edellyttää tai sen sallii, kun luovuttamisen perustana on käsityksemme mukaan lakisääteinen velvoite tai laillinen kanne.

**Kansainväliset tiedonsiirrot**

Honeywell on globaali organisaatio, ja henkilötietojasi voidaan siirtää eri maihin, kuten Yhdysvaltoihin, Meksikoon tai Intiaan sovellettavan lain mukaisesti sekä säilyttää, tallettaa tai käyttää näissä maissa. Tämä tarkoittaa, että kun keräämme henkilötietojasi, niitä voidaan käsitellä maissa, joiden tietosuojalait poikkeavat oman maasi laeista. Honeywell pyrkii kuitenkin aina kohtuullisiin toimin turvaamaan yksityisyytesi ja tarjoamaan oman asuinmaasi tietosuojan tasoisen henkilötietojen suojan. Näihin toimiin kuuluu Euroopan komission vakiosopimuslausekkeiden käyttö. Jos haluat lisätietoja henkilötietojesi suojaamiseksi toteutetuista toimista, ota yhteyttä sähköpostitse osoitteeseen [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com).

**Turva**

Olemme sitoutuneet pitämään henkilötietosi turvassa. Turvaamme henkilötietojasi teknisin ja organisatorisin toimin taataksemme niille käsittelyn riskeihin nähden asianmukaisen suojan. Jos haluat lisätietoja siitä, miten Honeywell suojaa henkilötietojasi, ota yhteyttä sähköpostitse osoitteeseen [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com)

**Oikeutesi**

Kulloinkin sovellettavasta laista riippuen sinulla voi olla tiettyjä henkilötietoihisi liittyviä oikeuksia.

* Sinulla voi olla oikeus **tarkastaa, korjata ja päivittää** henkilötietosi tai **pyytää niiden poistoa**.
* Voit **vastustaa** henkilötietojesi käsittelyä, pyytää meitä **rajoittamaan** henkilötietojesi käsittelyä tai esittää henkilötietojesi **siirrettävyyttä** koskevan pyynnön.
* Sinulla voi olla oikeus **estää yksinomaan automatisoituun käsittelyyn perustuva itseäsi koskeva päätöksenteko, kuten profilointi,** jos päätöksellä on sinua koskevia oikeusvaikutuksia tai se vaikuttaa sinuun merkittävästi.
* Jos henkilötietojesi keruu ja käsittely on tapahtunut suostumuksellasi, **voit perua suostumuksesi milloin tahansa**. Suostumuksesi peruminen ei vaikuta ennen perumista suoritetun käsittelyn laillisuuteen. Se ei myöskään vaikuta henkilötietojesi käsittelyyn siltä osin kuin käsittelyn oikeusperuste on muu kuin suostumus.
* Sinulla voi olla oikeus kieltää **henkilötietojesi myynti edelleen**. Honeywell ei myy henkilötietojasi kolmansille osapuolille saadakseen taloudellista hyötyä. Me kuitenkin jaamme tai luovutamme henkilötietojasi kolmansille osapuolille tämän Tietosuojalausunnon ja [Evästeilmoituksemme](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/cookie-notice#language6) rajauksin. Ulkoistamme kolmansille osapuolille esimerkiksi jälleenmyyntiä, teknisen tuen tarjoamista, verkkosivustojen analytiikkaa sekä tuotteiden ja palveluiden markkinointia ja myyntiä. Tällaiseen toimintaan voi liittyä henkilökohtaisten tietojesi luovuttaminen kolmansille osapuolille, joka voidaan katsoa tietojen myynniksi joidenkin (mutta ei kaikkien) tietosuojalakien nojalla.
* Sinulla on oikeus **tehdä valitus** sille tietosuojaviranomaiselle, joka vastaa henkilötietojen keruuta ja käyttöä koskevasta laillisuusvalvonnasta omassa maassasi, jos uskot meidän käsittelevän henkilötietojasi tietosuojalain vastaisesti. Esimerkiksi Euroopan talousalueella henkilö voi tehdä valituksen toimivaltaiselle tietosuojaviranomaiselle, jotka on listattu osoitteessa [https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members\_fi](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_fi). Toivomme kuitenkin, että keskustelet asiasta meidän kanssamme. Ota meihin yhteyttä, kun haluaisit valittaa. Emme syrji ketään siksi, että hän on ajanut tietosuojalakeihin perustuvia oikeuksiaan.

Olemme apuna lakisääteisten oikeuksiesi takaamisessa. Siinäkin tapauksessa, ettei tietosuojalaki suojaisi henkilötietojasi tietyssä tilanteessa, voimme kuitenkin pyrkiä vastaamaan tietojenkäsittelyämme koskeviin pyyntöihisi ja tiedusteluihisi. Jos sinulla on kysyttävää oikeuksistasi tai haluat käyttää niitä, ota meihin yhteyttä sähköpostitse osoitteeseen [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com) tai lähetä tietosuojakysymyksesi interaktiivisen verkkolomakkeemme kautta osoitteessa

Il se peut également que vous fournissiez des renseignements personnels lorsque vous communiquez avec nous (par exemple, pour envoyer un commentaire, une demande de renseignements ou une demande de soutien à la clientèle, visiter un site) ou que vous créiez un compte pour utiliser nos Sites. Ces renseignements personnels peuvent comprendre :

Nous recueillons automatiquement certaines informations vous concernant lors de votre visite sur nos Sites à l’aide de témoins et d’autres technologies de suivi similaires. Nous respecterons toujours tous les droits légaux dont vous pourriez disposer et qui nous empêcheraient de le faire. Les données collectées de cette façon comprennent :
    * **Des données sur l’utilisation,** y compris des renseignements sur l’utilisation que vous faites de nos Sites, les pages affichées, la quantité d’octets transférés, les liens visités, le contenu consulté, la date et l’heure auxquelles vous avez accédé au site, le site Web à partir duquel vous avez été redirigé vers l’un de nos Sites ainsi que toute autre activité effectuée sur les sites;
    * **Des données techniques,** comme votre adresse IP (Internet Protocol), le type et les capacités de votre navigateur, votre langue et votre système d’exploitation.

Pour plus d’informations sur les témoins et d’autres technologies de suivi similaires que nous utilisons sur nos Sites, veuillez consulter notre [Avis relatif aux témoins](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/cookie-notice#french-canadian).

* **Des données de géolocalisation**.Sur certains sites, avec votre consentement, nous pourrions collecter avec précision l’emplacement exact en temps réel de votre appareil mobile (c.-à-d. la géolocalisation). Ces informations ne seront utilisées que dans le but de faciliter votre utilisation des Sites, et pourront notamment être utilisées par nos fournisseurs de services, qui pourront traiter ces informations en relation avec la prestation de services en notre nom. Si vous accordez votre consentement, vous pouvez modifier celui-ci en gérant vos préférences de Services de localisation dans les paramètres de votre appareil mobile.
* **Renseignements recueillis auprès de tiers**. Conformément à la loi applicable, nous pouvons recueillir des renseignements personnels vous concernant auprès de tiers, comme des sites Web ou des applications de médias sociaux, et les combiner aux renseignements que nous détenons déjà afin de nous aider à améliorer et à personnaliser nos Sites selon vos préférences ainsi qu’à d’autres fins indiquées dans cet énoncé de confidentialité. Nous pouvons également recueillir vos coordonnées professionnelles auprès de votre employeur ou d’autres tiers afin de faciliter ou d’entreprendre des activités commerciales traditionnelles et des questions administratives similaires.

**La façon dont nous utilisons l’information**

Nous pouvons utiliser les renseignements personnels recueillis sur nos Sites ou lorsque vous communiquez avec nous aux fins suivantes :

* **Coordonnées professionnelles**. Honeywell collecte et utilise les coordonnées professionnelles afin d’effectuer des communications ou des transactions, y compris pour réaliser une vérification au préalable sur un produit ou un service ou la prestation ou réception d’un produit ou d’un service. Par exemple, Honeywell peut collecter et utiliser ces coordonnées professionnelles afin de faciliter et de gérer les commandes, les contrats, les garanties, la maintenance et des fonctions professionnelles similaires à des fins d’analyse du crédit et de collecte, pour nous assister dans le cadre de nos obligations juridiques et de conformité internes, et, si nécessaire, de défendre nos intérêts et nos demandes.
* **Services et transactions**. Nous pouvons utiliser vos renseignements personnels pour vous fournir des services ou effectuer des transactions que vous avez demandées, y compris, mais sans s’y limiter, pour vous fournir des informations sur des produits ou des services de la Société que vous avez achetés ou que vous utilisez, enregistrer des produits achetés, traiter des commandes de produits, traiter des réclamations sous garantie, remplacer des manuels des produits, répondre aux questions adressées au service à la clientèle et faciliter l’utilisation de nos Sites.
* **Gestion et protection de notre entreprise et de nos Sites**. Nous pouvons utiliser vos renseignements personnels pour gérer et protéger nos activités et nos Sites, y compris le dépannage, la maintenance du système, le soutien, la production de rapport et l’hébergement des données.
* **Amélioration de notre entreprise, de nos Sites, de nos produits et de nos services**. Nous pouvons utiliser vos renseignements personnels aux fins d’analyses commerciales ou à d’autres fins qui nous aident à développer et à améliorer la qualité de divers aspects de notre entreprise, de nos Sites et de nos produits et services (y compris les nouveaux produits et services), par exemple en adaptant nos Sites à vos préférences et à vos champs d’intérêt.
* **Marketing**. Conformément aux lois et réglementations applicables, nous pouvons utiliser vos renseignements personnels pour vous informer des produits ou des services susceptibles de vous intéresser et pour communiquer avec vous concernant des offres, des événements, des nouvelles, des sondages, des offres spéciales et des sujets connexes. Vous pouvez vous désabonner des communications marketing envoyées par courriel en tout temps en cliquant sur le lien de désabonnement figurant dans tout matériel de marketing par courriel que nous vous envoyons ou en communiquant avec nous à l’aide des coordonnées indiquées dans cet énoncé de confidentialité. Selon votre pays de résidence, vous pouvez également vous désabonner d’autres types de communications marketing; veuillez communiquer avec nous à l’aide des coordonnées indiquées dans l’énoncé de confidentialité pour plus d’informations. Certaines administrations (p. ex. les résidents de Californie) donnent aux personnes le droit de demander certaines informations concernant notre divulgation de renseignements personnels à des tiers à des fins de marketing direct. Pour de plus amples informations sur nos pratiques en matière de divulgation de données à des fins de marketing, veuillez nous contacter en suivant les directives ci-dessous.
* **Publicités ciblées par centre d’intérêt**. Nous collectons des données sur vos activités en ligne et déterminons vos centres d’intérêt afin de pouvoir vous proposer les publicités les plus pertinentes pour votre profil. Vous pouvez refuser de recevoir de la part de Honeywell des publicités ciblées par centre d’intérêt, comme décrit dans notre [Avis relatif aux témoins](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/cookie-notice#french-canadian).
* **Programmes d’incitation financière et de fidélité**. Nous collectons et utilisons des renseignements personnels pour gérer et administrer nos programmes d’incitation financière et de fidélité. Nous utilisons les renseignements personnels que vous fournissez dans le cadre de ces programmes pour offrir des récompenses uniques, suivre l’état de votre programme et faciliter l’échange de points de programme pour des produits, du matériel promotionnel, des ateliers de formation et d’autres articles. Dans la mesure permise par la loi, nous pouvons également utiliser les renseignements personnels que vous fournissez dans le cadre d’un programme d’incitation financière pour toute autre fin énoncée dans la présente Déclaration de confidentialité. Veuillez consulter les conditions générales de chaque programme d’incitation financière dans lequel vous souhaitez vous inscrire ou auquel vous souhaitez participer, car ces conditions générales peuvent être adaptées avec précision au programme applicable. Si vous acceptez de participer à ces programmes, vous pouvez à tout moment communiquer avec nous en utilisant les coordonnées à la fin de la présente Déclaration de confidentialité ou en suivant les instructions détaillées des conditions générales du programme en vigueur.
* **Demandes d’emploi**. Dans le cadre d’un renseignement ou d’une demande d’emploi, vous pourriez nous fournir des renseignements personnels, comme votre CV, des références professionnelles, des renseignements sur votre scolarité et vos antécédents d’emploi, ainsi que des renseignements sur vos formations ou certifications professionnelles. Les membres de notre groupe et nous-mêmes pouvons utiliser ces renseignements à des fins de recrutement, de vérification des antécédents et d’admissibilité à l’emploi, et tel qu’établi dans toute Déclaration de confidentialité ou tout autre avis distinct disponible en relation avec votre demande. Nous pouvons utiliser un tiers (p. ex. un recruteur) ou une plateforme de médias sociaux pour solliciter, collecter et conserver les demandes d’emploi. Pour plus d’informations, veuillez lire notre [Avis de confidentialité du candidat](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/applicant-privacy-notice#french-canadian).
* **Recherche et analyse**. Nous pouvons utiliser vos renseignements personnels pour effectuer des recherches et des analyses afin de nous aider à examiner vos préférences d’achat, à déterminer les produits et services qui répondent le mieux à vos besoins et à mesurer l’efficacité de la publicité que nous vous présentons.
* **Application**: Nous pouvons utiliser les renseignements personnels que nous recueillons afin de détecter, de prévenir et de combattre la fraude, l’utilisation abusive de nos Sites et la violation de la propriété intellectuelle, de nos conditions générales et des lois.

Si la loi le permet, nous pouvons combiner les renseignements que nous recueillons sur nos Sites à d’autres renseignements vous concernant que nous détenons (comme des renseignements sur votre utilisation de nos produits et services) afin de vous offrir une expérience client améliorée et cohérente lorsque vous interagissez avec nous ou à d’autres fins indiquées dans cet énoncé de confidentialité.

**Le fondement juridique sur lequel s’appuie notre traitement des renseignements**

Lorsque la loi l’exige, nous nous assurons qu’il existe un fondement juridique pour le traitement de vos renseignements personnels. Dans la plupart des cas, notre fondement juridique pour la collecte et l’utilisation des renseignements personnels décrits dans le présent Avis de confidentialité dépendra des renseignements personnels applicables et du contexte spécifique dans lequel nous les recueillons.

* **Contrat** : le traitement est nécessaire pour l’exécution des services que nous vous fournissons ou afin de prendre les mesures (à votre demande) avant et en prévision de l’exécution de ces services;
* **Obligation juridique** : le traitement est nécessaire pour nous conformer à nos obligations légales, y compris le respect des lois, des règlements, des demandes gouvernementales et quasi gouvernementales, des ordonnances ou des citations à comparaître applicables;
* **Consentement** : le traitement est fondé sur votre consentement au traitement de vos renseignements personnels à une ou plusieurs fins précisées (par exemple, à des fins de marketing);
* **Intérêts légitimes** : le traitement est nécessaire pour répondre à nos intérêts légitimes, par exemple pour développer et améliorer nos Sites, nos produits ou nos services au profit de nos clients.
* **Intérêts vitaux** : le traitement est nécessaire pour protéger vos intérêts vitaux (par exemple, pour des raisons de santé et de sécurité si vous assistez à une réunion dans un établissement Honeywell).

Si vous avez des questions ou avez besoin d’autres renseignements en ce qui concerne le fondement juridique de notre collecte et de notre utilisation de vos renseignements personnels, veuillez envoyer un courriel à [HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com).

**L’anonymisation des informations**

Conformément à la loi applicable, nous pouvons anonymiser vos renseignements personnels afin qu’ils ne puissent plus être utilisés pour vous identifier. Les renseignements anonymisés ne sont pas considérés comme des renseignements personnels; ils ne sont donc pas assujettis à cet énoncé de confidentialité. Nous pouvons recueillir, utiliser, regrouper et partager des renseignements anonymisés à n’importe quelle fin.

**Durée de conservation des renseignements**

La période durant laquelle nous conservons vos renseignements personnels varie en fonction de l’objectif de traitement. Par exemple, nous conservons les renseignements personnels nécessaires pour vous fournir des produits et des services ou pour faciliter les transactions que vous avez demandées aussi longtemps que vous êtes un client de Honeywell ou si vous soumettez une demande d’emploi sur nos Sites, nous conserverons les détails de votre demande comme l’indique l’énoncé de confidentialité ou tout autre avis mis à votre disposition dans le cadre de votre demande ou comme la loi l’exige. Dans tous les autres cas, nous conservons vos renseignements personnels aussi longtemps que nécessaire aux fins décrites dans cet énoncé de confidentialité, après quoi ils sont anonymisés (lorsque la loi applicable le permet), supprimés ou détruits.

**Divulgation des informations**

Nous pouvons partager vos renseignements personnels avec des tiers sélectionnés conformément à la loi applicable, y compris comme indiqué ci-dessous :

* **Les sociétés de notre groupe**. Nous pouvons partager vos renseignements personnels avec nos sociétés affiliées et les sociétés de notre groupe pour des utilisations raisonnablement nécessaires aux fins décrites dans le présent énoncé de confidentialité.
* **Les fournisseurs de services**. Nous pouvons partager vos renseignements personnels avec des entreprises que nous avons engagées pour la prestation de services pour notre compte, comme l’hébergement de sites Web, la réalisation de sondages, le traitement de transactions, l’analyse de nos Sites et la production d’analyses pour améliorer la qualité de divers aspects de notre entreprise, de nos Sites et de nos produits et services. Nous exigeons que ces fournisseurs de services protègent la confidentialité de vos renseignements personnels.
* **Les distributeurs et autres partenaires commerciaux de confiance**. Nous pourrions partager vos renseignements personnels avec des tiers qui distribuent nos produits et avec d’autres partenaires commerciaux de confiance à des fins comprenant la possibilité que ces tiers communiquent avec vous à des fins de marketing. Le partage de renseignements personnels à des fins de marketing sera effectué conformément aux lois et règlements applicables.
* **Divulgation de renseignements dans le contexte d’une transaction**. Dans le cadre de certaines transactions, nous pourrions divulguer une partie ou l’intégralité de vos renseignements personnels aux institutions financières, entités gouvernementales et sociétés d’expédition ou services postaux qui participent à l’exécution de la transaction.
* **Divulgation en lien avec des acquisitions ou des cessions**. Dans certaines circonstances, il est possible que la Société décide, pour des questions stratégiques ou d’autres raisons professionnelles, de vendre, d’acheter, de désinvestir, de fusionner ou de réorganiser autrement les activités dans certains pays ou de se départir de ces activités. Il se peut que nous divulguions des renseignements à votre sujet dans la mesure nécessaire à juste titre afin de mener les négociations, voire de procéder à la fusion, à l’acquisition, au désinvestissement ou à la vente des actifs de Honeywell en tout ou en partie.
* **Divulgation pour d’autres motifs**. Nous pouvons divulguer des renseignements personnels si la loi l’exige ou l’autorise ou si nous jugeons en toute bonne foi qu’une telle action est nécessaire pour nous conformer à des obligations légales ou à des recours en droit exercés à notre égard, pour protéger et défendre nos droits et nos biens, ou dans des circonstances urgentes de protection de la sécurité personnelle de tout individu.

**Transferts internationaux**

Compte tenu du fait que Honeywell est une organisation internationale, vos renseignements personnels peuvent être transférés, détenus, conservés ou utilisés sur différentes plateformes à travers le monde, par exemple aux États-Unis, au Mexique et en Inde conformément aux lois applicables. Cela signifie que lorsque nous recueillons vos renseignements, ceux-ci peuvent être traités dans des pays appliquant des lois sur la protection des données différentes des lois de votre pays. Toutefois, Honeywell prendra toujours des mesures raisonnables pour protéger votre vie privée et pour assurer un niveau de protection des renseignements personnels comparable à celui de votre pays de résidence, y compris par la mise en œuvre des clauses contractuelles standard de la Commission européenne. Pour de plus amples informations sur les mesures de protection appropriées qui ont été mises en place pour protéger vos renseignements personnels, veuillez nous contacter à l’adresse [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com).

**Sécurité**

Nous nous engageons à protéger la sécurité de vos renseignements personnels. Nous avons recours à des mesures techniques et organisationnelles pour fournir un niveau de sécurité adapté au risque de traitement de vos renseignements personnels. Pour plus d’informations sur la façon dont Honeywell protège vos renseignements personnels, veuillez nous contacter à l’adresse [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com).

**Vos droits**

Selon la loi en vigueur, vous pouvez disposer de certains droits quant à vos renseignements personnels.

* Vous pouvez avoir le droit **d’accéder, de corriger, de mettre à jour** ou **de demander la suppression** de vos renseignements personnels.
* Vous pouvez vous **opposer** au traitement de vos renseignements personnels, nous demander de **restreindre** le traitement de vos renseignements personnels ou demander la **transférabilité** de vos renseignements personnels.
* Vous disposez du droit **de refuser qu’une décision soit prise uniquement sur la base d’un traitement automatisé, y compris le profilage,** si cette décision génère des effets juridiques à votre encontre ou vous affecte de manière significative.
* De la même façon, si nous avons recueilli et traité vos renseignements personnels avec votre consentement, **vous pouvez retirer votre consentement en tout temps**. Le retrait de votre consentement n’aura aucune incidence sur la légalité de tout traitement que nous avons effectué avant votre retrait, et cela n’affectera pas le traitement de vos renseignements personnels reposant sur des motifs de traitement licites autres que le consentement.
* Vous pouvez avoir le droit de **refuser la vente de vos renseignements personnels**. Honeywell ne vend pas vos renseignements personnels à des tiers afin d’en tirer profit. Toutefois, nous partageons ou divulguons vos renseignements personnels à des tiers conformément à la présente Déclaration de confidentialité et à notre [Avis relatif aux témoins](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/cookie-notice#french-canadian). Par exemple, nous collaborons avec des tiers pour distribuer nos produits, vous fournir une assistance technique, exploiter des outils et des fonctionnalités analytiques du site Web, et procéder à la commercialisation et à la vente de nos produits et services. Ces activités peuvent impliquer la divulgation de vos renseignements personnels à des tiers et peuvent être considérées comme une « vente » de données en vertu de certaines lois (mais pas toutes) sur la protection des données.
* Vous avez le droit de **porter plainte auprès** d’une autorité de protection des données responsable de l’application de la loi sur la protection des données dans votre juridiction concernant la collecte et l’utilisation de vos renseignements personnels si vous pensez que le traitement de vos renseignements personnels ne respecte pas la loi sur la protection des données.

Wenn Sie Fragen haben oder weitere Informationen zur Rechtsgrundlage benötigen, anhand derer wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten erfassen und verwenden, senden Sie bitte eine E-Mail an [HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com)

**Anonymisierung von Informationen**

Gemäß geltendem Recht kann es sein, dass wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten anonymisieren, sodass sie nicht mehr verwendet werden können, um Sie zu identifizieren. Anonymisierte Informationen gelten nicht als personenbezogene Daten und unterliegen daher nicht dieser Datenschutzerklärung. Wir können anonymisierte Informationen zu jedem Zweck erheben, verwenden, aggregieren und weitergeben.

**Dauer der Aufbewahrung von Informationen**

Der Zeitraum, über den wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten speichern, ist vom Zweck der Verarbeitung abhängig. Personenbezogene Daten, die wir benötigen, um Ihnen Produkte und Dienstleistungen zur Verfügung zu stellen oder um Transaktionen zu ermöglichen, die Sie angefordert haben, speichern wir beispielsweise, solange Sie Kunde von Honeywell sind. Wenn Sie eine Bewerbung über unsere Sites einreichen, bewahren wir Informationen über Ihre Bewerbung wie in der Datenschutzerklärung, die Ihnen im Zusammenhang mit Ihrer Bewerbung zur Verfügung gestellt wurde, dargelegt oder wie anderweitig gesetzlich vorgeschrieben auf. In allen anderen Fällen speichern wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten solange wie notwendig, um die in dieser Datenschutzerklärung beschriebenen Zwecke zu erfüllen. Anschließend werden sie entweder anonymisiert (soweit gesetzlich zulässig), gelöscht oder vernichtet.

**Offenlegung von Informationen**

Gemäß geltendem Gesetz geben wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten möglicherweise an ausgewählte Dritte weiter, einschließlich der im Folgenden beschriebenen Dritten:

* **Unternehmen unserer Gruppe**. Möglicherweise geben wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten an unsere Tochterunternehmen und Unternehmen der Gruppe weiter, wie angemessenerweise für die in dieser Datenschutzerklärung beschriebenen Zwecke notwendig.
* **Dienstanbieter**. Möglicherweise geben wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten an Unternehmen weiter, die wir mit der Bereitstellung von Dienstleistungen in unserem Namen beauftragt haben, beispielsweise dem Hosten von Websites, der Durchführung von Umfragen, der Verarbeitung von Transaktionen, der Analyse unserer Sites und der Durchführung von Analysen zur Verbesserung der Qualität unseres Geschäfts, unserer Sites, Produkte und Dienstleistungen. Diese Dienstanbieter müssen die Vertraulichkeit Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten sicherstellen.
* **Vertriebspartner und andere vertrauenswürdige Geschäftspartner**. Möglicherweise geben wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten an Dritte, die unsere Produkte vertreiben, und andere vertrauenswürdige Geschäftspartner weiter. Dies dient möglicherweise auch dem Zweck, dass diese Dritten Ihnen Marketingmitteilungen senden. Die Weitergabe personenbezogener Daten zu Marketingzwecken erfolgt gemäß geltenden Gesetzen und Vorschriften.
* **Offenlegung in Verbindung mit Transaktionen**. In Verbindung mit bestimmten Transaktionen kann es vorkommen, dass wir Ihre persönlichen Daten oder einen Teil davon Geldinstituten, Regierungsbehörden, Frachtunternehmen oder Postbehörden offenlegen, die an der Transaktionsabwicklung beteiligt sind.
* **Offenlegung von Informationen in Verbindung mit Akquisitionen oder Veräußerungen**. Es kann Situationen geben, in denen Honeywell aus strategischen oder anderen geschäftlichen Gründen beschließt, Unternehmen in einigen Ländern zu verkaufen, zu kaufen, zu veräußern, zu fusionieren oder anderweitig neu zu organisieren. Wir können Informationen, die wir über Sie aufbewahren, in dem Umfang offenlegen, der vernünftigerweise notwendig ist, um einen Zusammenschluss, eine Akquisition, eine Veräußerung oder einen Verkauf von Honeywell-Vermögen oder -Teilvermögen aushandeln und durchführen zu können.
* **Offenlegung von Informationen aus anderen Gründen**. Wir können personenbezogene Daten offenlegen, sofern dies im Rahmen von Gesetzesvorschriften bzw. im Vertrauen darauf erfolgt, dass diese Maßnahme aus einem der folgenden Gründe erforderlich ist: Einhaltung gesetzlicher Verpflichtungen oder Anordnungen, Schutz unserer Rechte und unseres Eigentums oder in dringenden Fällen Schutz der persönlichen Sicherheit einer Person.

**Internationale Datenübermittlungen**

Honeywell ist ein weltweit tätiges Unternehmen. Daher werden Ihre personenbezogenen Daten möglicherweise gemäß geltendem Recht an verschiedene Standorte weltweit – beispielsweise die USA, Mexiko und Indien – übermittelt und dort aufbewahrt, gespeichert oder verwendet. Das bedeutet, dass die von uns erhobenen personenbezogenen Daten möglicherweise in Ländern verarbeitet werden, deren Datenschutzgesetze sich von den Datenschutzgesetzen Ihres Landes unterscheiden. Honeywell wird jedoch stets angemessene Schritte unternehmen, um Ihre Privatsphäre zu schützen und einen Grad an Schutz für Ihre personenbezogene Daten zu bieten, der mit dem Grad an Schutz in Ihrem Wohnsitzland vergleichbar ist. Dies umfasst auch die Implementierung der Standardvertragsklauseln der Europäischen Kommission. Wenn Sie weitere Informationen über die geeigneten Sicherheitsvorkehrungen zum Schutz Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten wünschen, kontaktieren Sie uns bitte unter [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com).

**Sicherheit**

Wir sind bestrebt, die Sicherheit Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten zu schützen. Wir setzen technische und organisatorische Maßnahmen ein, um ein Sicherheitsniveau zu bieten, das dem mit der Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten verbundenen Risiko angemessen ist. Wenn Sie weitere Informationen darüber wünschen, wie Honeywell Ihre personenbezogenen Daten schützt, kontaktieren Sie uns bitte unter [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com)

**Ihre Rechte**

Abhängig von den geltenden Gesetzen haben Sie möglicherweise bestimmte Rechte in Bezug auf Ihre personenbezogenen Daten.

* Sie haben möglicherweise das Recht, auf Ihre personenbezogenen Daten **zuzugreifen, diese zu korrigieren, zu aktualisieren** oder **ihre Löschung zu beantragen**.
* Sie können der Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten **widersprechen**, uns auffordern, die Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten **einzuschränken** oder die **Übertragbarkeit** Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten anfordern.
* Möglicherweise haben Sie ein Recht darauf, **dass keine Entscheidung über Sie getroffen wird, die ausschließlich auf einer automatisierten Verarbeitung basiert, einschließlich Profilierung,** wenn eine solche Entscheidung rechtliche Folgen für Sie hat oder Sie erheblich beeinträchtigt.
* Wenn wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten mit Ihrer Zustimmung erfasst und verarbeitet haben, **können Sie Ihre Zustimmung jederzeit zurückziehen**. Die Zurückziehung Ihrer Zustimmung hat keinen Einfluss auf die Gesetzlichkeit einer Verarbeitung, die wir vor dieser Zurückziehung ausgeführt haben. Sie hat auch keinen Einfluss auf eine Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten, die auf anderen gesetzlichen Grundlagen als Ihrer Zustimmung basiert.
* Sie haben möglicherweise das Recht, dem **Verkauf Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten zu widersprechen**. Honeywell verkauft Ihre personenbezogenen Daten nicht gewinnbringend an Dritte. Allerdings geben wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten in Übereinstimmung mit dieser Datenschutzerklärung und unserem [Hinweis zu Cookies](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/cookie-notice#german) an Dritte weiter oder legen sie anderweitig Dritten gegenüber offen. So beauftragen wir beispielsweise Drittanbieter, unsere Produkte zu vertreiben, Ihnen technische Unterstützung zu bieten, analytische Tools und Funktionen für die Website zu betreiben und unsere Produkte und Dienstleistungen zu vermarkten und zu verkaufen. Solche Aktivitäten können die Offenlegung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten gegenüber Dritten beinhalten und gemäß bestimmten (jedoch nicht allen) Datenschutzgesetzen als „Verkauf“ von Daten angesehen werden.
* Sie haben das Recht, sich bei einer Datenschutzbehörde, die für die Überwachung der Einhaltung der Datenschutzgesetze in Ihrem Rechtsraum zuständig ist, über unsere Erhebung und Verwendung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten zu **beschweren**, wenn Sie der Meinung sind, dass unsere Verarbeitung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten nicht den Datenschutzgesetzen entspricht. Personen im EWR haben beispielsweise das Recht, bei der zuständigen Datenschutzbehörde eine Beschwerde einzureichen. Eine Liste dieser Datenschutzbehörden finden Sie unter folgendem Link: [https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members\_en](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en). Wir würden es jedoch schätzen, wenn wir Gelegenheit erhielten, auf Ihre Bedenken zu reagieren. Bitte nehmen Sie daher im Fall einer Beschwerde Kontakt mit uns auf. Wir werden Einzelpersonen nicht diskriminieren, wenn sie ihre Datenschutzrechte ausüben.

Wir unterstützen Sie bei der Ausübung Ihrer Rechte entsprechend den geltenden Gesetzen. Doch auch wenn Ihre personenbezogenen Daten nicht durch ein Datenschutzgesetz geschützt sind und auch nicht anderweitig unter ein Datenschutzgesetz fallen, werden wir versuchen, Ihren Wünschen oder Anfragen in Bezug auf unsere Datenverarbeitung nachzukommen.

**Bevezetés**

A Honeywell International Inc. (a továbbiakban „**Honeywell**” vagy „**mi**”) adatkezelőként jár el azoknak az adatoknak az esetében, amelyeket akkor gyűjtünk, amikor Ön felkeresi vagy használja bármelyik webhelyünket, vagy amikor a jelen Adatvédelmi nyilatkozat hatálya alá eső termékeket, szolgáltatásokat és alkalmazásokat használ (együttesen: „**Webhelyeink**”). A jelen Adatvédelmi nyilatkozat ismerteti, hogyan gyűjtjük, osztjuk meg és használjuk fel a fent ismertetett módon gyűjtött személyes adatokat, és leírja, hogyan gyakorolhatja Ön az adatvédelemhez fűződő jogait.

Amikor kapcsolatba lépünk Önnel, további adatvédelmi tájékoztatókat is küldhetünk az egyes konkrét adatkezelési tevékenységekre vonatkozóan, vagy további választási lehetőségeket kínálhatunk a Honeywell által az Ön adatain az adott esetben végzett adatkezelési tevékenységek kapcsán.

**Az általunk végzett adatgyűjtés**

* **Közvetlenül Öntől gyűjtött adatok**. A szolgáltatások biztosításához, valamint a kért tranzakciók végrehajtásához szükség esetén személyes adatokat kérünk Öntől. Emellett akkor is megadhat nekünk személyes adatokat, amikor Ön veszi fel velünk a kapcsolatot vagy valamilyen interakcióba lép velünk (például kommentet ír, érdeklődést vagy ügyfélszolgálati megkeresést küld be, esetleg felkeresi az oldalainkat), vagy felhasználói fiókot hoz létre Webhelyeink használatához. Ezeknek a személyes adatoknak a körébe az alábbiak tartoznak:
    * **Személyazonosító adatok,** például név, cím, vállalat/szervezet neve, e-mail-cím, telefon- és faxszám és postacím (utca, település, állam, irányítószám és/vagy ország);
    * **Regisztrációs adatok**, azaz a webhelyeink használatához szükséges fiók regisztrálása során megadott adatok, például felhasználónév és jelszó;
    * **Munkaerő-felvétellel kapcsolatos adatok,** ideértve a meghirdetett állásokkal vagy a beküldött érdeklődésekkel kapcsolatban megadott információkat (ezeket alább ismertetjük);
    * **Üzleti kapcsolattartási adatok,** például egy harmadik szervezet (például vállalkozás, cég, társaság, egyéni vállalkozás, nonprofit szervezet vagy kormányzati szerv) alkalmazottjaira, tulajdonosaira, igazgatóira, tisztségviselőire vagy alvállalkozóira vonatkozó információk,
    * **Marketing- és kommunikációs adatok,** ideértve a marketingpreferenciákat és a kiadványainkra vonatkozó előfizetéseket;
    * **Pénzügyi adatok,** például bankkártya- és egyéb számlaadatok a webhelyeinken elérhető termékek és szolgáltatások megvásárlásának elősegítése érdekében;
    * **Exportellenőrzési adatok,** például nemzetiség, állampolgárság és lakhely szerinti ország, amelyek segítségével meghatározhatjuk, hogy az exportellenőrzési rendeletek értelmében küldhetünk-e Önnek információkat bizonyos technológiákról;
    * **Tranzakciós adatok,** ideértve a termékeinkkel és a szolgáltatásainkkal kapcsolatos érdeklődések, megrendelések és az Önnek küldött, valamint az Öntől fogadott kifizetések részleteit, valamint a megrendelési előzményeket és a fizetési tranzakciók lebonyolításához szükséges információkat;
    * **Eseményregisztrációval kapcsolatos adatok,** többek között az e-regisztrációs űrlapok kitöltése során megadott adatok; és
    * **Az Ön visszajelzései,** beleértve a felméréseket, az ajánlásokat és más, a Webhelyeinkkel, valamint a termékeinkkel és szolgáltatásainkkal kapcsolatos általános visszajelzéseket.

Ha nem adja meg a kért adatokat, előfordulhat, hogy nem tudjuk Önnek biztosítani a kért szolgáltatást, vagy nem tudjuk teljesíteni tranzakcióit.

* **Az Önről automatikusan gyűjtött adatok**. Bizonyos információkat cookie-k és hasonló nyomkövető technológiák segítségével rögzítünk a Webhelyeinken tett látogatásáról. Ha Önnek joga van letiltani az ilyen adatgyűjtést, ezt a kérését minden esetben tiszteletben tartjuk. Az ilyen módon gyűjtött adatok közé a következők tartoznak:
    * **Használati adatok,** például azzal kapcsolatos adatok, hogy Ön hogyan használja a Webhelyeket, a megtekintett oldalak, az átvitt bájtok száma, a megnyitott hivatkozások, a megtekintett anyagok, a Webhely megnyitásának dátuma és időpontja, a webhely, amelyről a mi Webhelyünkre érkezett, valamint a Webhelyen végzett egyéb műveletek; és
    * **Technikai adatok,** például IP-cím, a böngésző típusa, valamint az operációs rendszer jellemzői és nyelve.

A Webhelyeinken használt cookie-król és más hasonló nyomkövető technológiákról a [Cookie-kkal kapcsolatos közleményben](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/cookie-notice#hungarian) olvashat.

* **Földrajzi helyekkel kapcsolatos adatok**. Egyes Webhelyek esetén az Ön hozzájárulásával rögzíthetjük a mobileszköz pontos, valós idejű helyét (azaz az eszköz helyadatait). Ezeket az adatokat kizárólag arra használjuk fel, hogy lehetővé tegyük Önnek a Webhelyek használatát. Az általunk különböző szolgáltatások biztosításával megbízott partnerek is kizárólag ebből a célból dolgozzák fel ezeket az adatokat. A hozzájárulást a későbbiekben a mobileszköz helyadatokkal kapcsolatos beállításaiban módosíthatja.
* **Harmadik felektől gyűjtött adatok**. A hatályos törvények betartásával harmadik felektől, például közösségimédia-webhelyekről és -alkalmazásokból is gyűjthetünk adatokat Önről, amlyeket az Önről más forrásokból gyűjtött információkkal kombinálhatunk. Ezekat az adatokat Webhelyeink fejlesztésére és az Ön igényei szerinti személyre szabására, valamint a jelen Adatvédelmi nyilatkozatban meghatározott egyéb célokra használhatjuk fel. Emellett az Ön munkáltatójától vagy más harmadik felektől is gyűjthetünk üzleti kapcsolattartási adatokat Önről, amelyeket a szokásos üzleti tevékenységek és adminisztratív feladatok elvégzésére használunk fel.

**Az adatok felhasználása**

A Webhelyeinken keresztül, valamint a velünk való kapcsolatfelvétel során gyűjtött személyes adatokat többek között az alábbi célokra használhatjuk fel:

* **Üzleti kapcsolattartási adatok**. A Honeywell a kapcsolat felvétele vagy tranzakciók lebonyolítása céljából gyűjti össze és használja fel az üzleti kapcsolattartási adatokat. Ilyen tevékenység lehet például a termék vagy szolgáltatások biztosításával vagy fogadásával kapcsolatos átvilágítás. A Honeywell például összegyűjtheti és felhasználhatja az üzleti kapcsolattartási adatokat a megrendelések, a szerződések, a jótállások, a karbantartási tevékenységek és más, hasonló üzleti feladatkörök elvégzése és kezelése érdekében, hitelelemzési és behajtási célokra, saját belső megfelelőségi és jogi követelményeink teljesítése érdekében, valamint (szükség esetén) érdekeink és követeléseink védelmére.
* **Szolgáltatások és tranzakciók**. Személyes adatait felhasználhatjuk az Ön által kért szolgáltatások biztosítására és tranzakciók lebonyolítására, ideértve többek között a következőket: a megvásárolt vagy használt vállalati termékekkel és szolgáltatásokkal kapcsolatos tájékoztatás, megvásárolt termékek regisztrálása, megrendelések feldolgozása, jótállási igények kezelése, kézikönyvek cseréje, ügyfélszolgálati kérések megválaszolása és a Webhelyeink használatának elősegítése.
* **Üzleti tevékenységünk és Webhelyeink kezelése és védelme** Személyes adatait felhasználhatjuk üzleti tevékenységünk és Webhelyeink kezelésére és védelmére, ideértve többek között a hibaelhárítást, a rendszerkarbantartást, a támogatást, a jelentések készítését és az adatok hosztolását.
* **Üzleti tevékenységünk, Webhelyeink, termékeink és szolgáltatásaink fejlesztése**. Személyes adatait felhasználhatjuk üzleti elemzések készítéséhez, valamint üzleti tevékenységünk, Webhelyeink, termékeink és szolgáltatásaink minőségének fejlesztését szolgáló további célokra (az új termékeket és szolgáltatásokat is beleértve), például arra, hogy Webhelyeinket az Ön preferenciáinak és érdeklődési körének megfelelően személyre szabjuk.
* **Marketing**. A hatályos törvényeknek és rendeleteknek megfelelően személyes adatait felhasználhatjuk arra, hogy tájékoztassuk azokról a termékekről és szolgáltatásokról, amelyek érdekelhetik Önt, és más módokon is megkeressük Önt különböző ajánlatok, események, hírek, felmérések, különleges ajánlatok és más, hasonló témák kapcsán. Az e-mailben kapott marketingkommunikációs anyagokról bármikor díjmentesen leiratkozhat. Ehhez kattintson a tőlünk kapott e-marketing anyagokban található „Leiratkozás” hivatkozásra, vagy vegye fel velünk a kapcsolatot a jelen Adatvédelmi nyilatkozatban felsorolt elérhetőségek egyikén. A lakóhelye szerinti országtól függően előfordulhat, hogy más típusú marketingkommunikációs anyagokról is leiratkozhat; további információért vegye fel velünk a kapcsolatot a jelen Adatvédelmi nyilatkozatban felsorolt elérhetőségek egyikén. Egyes joghatóságok (például Kalifornia) lehetővé teszik, hogy polgáraik tájékoztatást kérjenek tőlünk arról, hogy milyen személyes adataikat adjuk át harmadik feleknek közvetlen üzletszerzési célokra. Ha szeretne többet tudni az adatok marketingcélú továbbítására vonatkozó gyakorlatunkról, vegye fel velünk a kapcsolatot az alábbiakban olvasható utasításokat követve.
* **Érdeklődésen alapuló hirdetések**. Adatokat gyűjtünk az interneten Ön által végzett tevékenységekről, és ezek alapján azonosítjuk az érdeklődési köreit, hogy így relevánsabb hirdetéseket tudjunk megjeleníteni Önnek. A Honeywell érdeklődésen alapuló hirdetéseiről a [Cookie-kkal kapcsolatos közleményben](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/cookie-notice#hungarian) leírtak szerint iratkozhat le.
* **Pénzügyi ösztönzők és hűségprogramok**. Pénzügyi ösztönzőink és hűségprogramjaink működtetéséhez és kezeléséhez is személyes adatokat gyűjtünk és használunk fel. Az Ön által e programok kapcsán megadott személyes adatokat arra használjuk fel, hogy egyedi jutalmakat ajánljunk fel, nyomon kövessük a program státuszát, és lehetővé tegyük a programban szerzett pontok termékekre, promóciós anyagokra, képzésekre és másokra való beváltását. A jogszabályok által megengedett mértékben a pénzügyi ösztönzőprogramok keretében megadott személyes adatokat a jelen Adatvédelmi nyilatkozatban meghatározott egyéb célokra is felhasználhatjuk. Ha szeretne regisztrálni egy ilyen pénzügyi ösztönzőprogramra, vagy részt venni valamelyik programban, olvassa el a program feltételeit, mivel bizonyos esetekben ezek a feltételek kizárólag az adott programra vonatkozó információkat tartalmaznak. Ha vállalja, hogy részt vesz egy ilyen programban, bármikor visszavonhatja ezt a hozzájárulását. Ehhez lépjen kapcsolatba velünk a jelen Adatvédelmi nyilatkozat végén megadott elérhetőségeken keresztül, vagy kövesse az adott program feltételeiben meghatározott utasításokat.
* **Álláspályázatok**. Álláspályázata vagy hasonló megkeresése kapcsán is személyes adatokat adhat át nekünk, ilyen például az önéletrajza, a szakmai referenciái, a végzettségével és a szakmai hátterével, valamint a szakmai képzettségével és bizonyítványaival kapcsolatos információk. Mi és vállalatcsoportunk tagjai felhasználhatjuk ezeket az adatokat az állás betöltéséhez, a háttérellenőrzések elvégzéséhez és a munkavállalásra való alkalmasság ellenőrzéséhez, valamint a jelentkezése kapcsán rendelkezésre bocsátott külön adatvédelmi nyilatkozatban vagy más tájékoztatóban foglalt további célokra. Bizonyos esetben harmadik feleket (például állásközvetítő céget) vagy közösségimédia-platformokat is igénybe vehetünk az álláspályázatok bekéréséhez, összegyűjtéséhez és megőrzéséhez. További információkért olvassa el az [állásra jelentkezőkre vonatkozó adatvédelmi nyilatkozatunka](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/applicant-privacy-notice#hungarian)t.
* **Kutatás és elemzések**. Személyes adatait felhasználhatjuk különböző kutatások és elemzések elvégzésére, amelyek célja a vásárlási preferenciák vizsgálata, az Ön igényeinek leginkább megfelelő termékek és szolgáltatások megkeresése, valamint az Önnek megjelenített hirdetések hatékonyságának felmérése.
* **Végrehajtás**: Az Önről gyűjtött személyes adatokat felhasználhatjuk a csalások, a szerzői jogsértések, a törvénysértések, a felhasználási feltételeink megsértésének, valamint a Webhelyeink egyéb helytelen használatának észlelésére, megelőzésére és kezelésére.

Ha a jogszabályok megengedik, a Webhelyeinken gyűjtött információkat az Önről tárolt egyéb adatokkal (például a termékek és szolgáltatások használatával kapcsolatos adatokkal) kombinálva felhasználhatjuk a jelen Adatvédelmi nyilatkozatban meghatározott célokra és arra, hogy jobb és egységesebb ügyfélélményt biztosítsunk Önnek a velünk folytatott interakciók során.

**Az adatkezelés jogalapja**

Ha a jogszabályok előírják, gondoskodunk arról, hogy személyes adatai feldolgozásának megfelelő jogalapja legyen. A legtöbb esetben a hivatkozott jogalap az érintett személyes adatoktól és ezek begyűjtésének konkrét körülményeitől függ.

* **Szerződés**: az adatkezelés az általunk Önnek nyújtott szolgáltatások biztosításához szükséges, vagy ahhoz, hogy (az Ön kérésére) megtegyük az ilyen szolgáltatások teljesítését megelőzően szükséges lépéseket;
* **Jogi kötelezettség**: az adatok kezelésére jogi kötelezettségeinknek, többek között a hatályos törvényeknek, jogszabályoknak, kormányzati és ezzel egyenértékű kérelmeknek, bírósági rendeleteknek vagy idézéseknek való megfelelés érdekében van szükség;
* **Hozzájárulás**: az adatkezelés alapja, hogy Ön hozzájárult személyes adatai egy vagy több célra (például marketingcélokra) való kezeléséhez;
* **Jogos érdek**: az adatkezelésre jogos érdekből, például Webhelyeink, termékeink és/vagy szolgáltatásaink ügyfeleink érdekében történő fejlesztéséhez és javításához van szükség; vagy
* **Létfontosságú érdek**: az adatkezelés az Ön létfontosságú érdekeinek védelméhez szükséges (például egészségügyi és biztonsági okokból, ha Ön a Honeywell egyik telephelyén vesz részt egy megbeszélésen).

Ha bármilyen kérdése van, vagy további információra van szüksége a személyes adatok gyűjtésének és felhasználásának jogalapjáról, írjon nekünk a következő e-mail-címre: [HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com)

**Az adatok névtelenítése**

A hatályos jogszabályoknak megfelelően bizonyos esetekben anonimizáljuk személyes adatait, amelyek ezt követően nem lesznek alkalmasak az Ön azonosítására. A névtelenített adatok nem számítanak személyes adatoknak, azért ezekre a jelen Adatvédelmi nyilatkozat nem vonatkozik. Névtelen adatokat bármilyen célból gyűjthetünk, felhasználhatunk, összesíthetünk és megoszthatunk.

**Az adatok megőrzésének időtartama**

A személyes adatok megőrzésének időtartama a feldolgozás céljától függően eltérő lehet. Például az Ön által kért termékek és szolgáltatások biztosításához vagy a tranzakciók teljesítéséhez szükséges személyes adatokat mindaddig megőrizzük, amíg Ön a Honeywell ügyfele. Továbbá ha Ön a Webhelyeinken keresztül állásra jelentkezik nálunk, a jelentkezés kapcsán átadott adatvédelmi tájékoztatóban vagy a jogszabályokban előírtaknak megfelelően őrizzük meg a jelentkezéséhez kapcsolódó adatokat. A személyes adatokat minden más esetben a jelen Adatvédelmi nyilatkozatban meghatározott célok teljesítéséhez szükséges ideig őrizzük meg, amelyet követően az adatokat névtelenítjük (ha a hatályos jogszabályok ezt lehetővé teszik), töröljük vagy megsemmisítjük.

**Az adatok továbbítása**

A hatályos törvényeknek megfelelően személyes adatait bizonyos harmadik felekkel is megoszthatjuk. Ezeket a harmadik feleket az alábbiakban ismertetjük:

* **Vállalatcsoportunkhoz tartozó társaságok**. Személyes adatait a jelen Adatvédelmi nyilatkozatban meghatározott célokhoz szükséges mértékben megoszthatjuk társvállalatainkkal és a csoporthoz tartozó vállalatokkal.
* **Szolgáltatók**. Személyes adatait megoszthatjuk a megbízásunkból szerződéses alapon különböző szolgáltatásokat nyújtó vállalatokkal, amelyek például webhelyeinket üzemeltetik, felméréseket végeznek, tranzakciókat dolgoznak fel, elemzéseket végeznek Webhelyeinken, valamint üzleti tevékenységünk, Webhelyeink, termékeink és szolgáltatásaink minőségének javítását célzó elemzéseket végeznek. E szolgáltatók számára előírjuk, hogy minden esetben bizalmasan kezeljék az Ön személyes adatait.
* **Forgalmazók és más megbízható üzleti partnerek**. Személyes adatait megoszthatjuk a termékeinket forgalmazó harmadik felekkel és más megbízható üzleti partnerekkel, és többek között engedélyezhetjük az ilyen harmadik feleknek, hogy marketinganyagokat küldjenek Önnek. A személyes adatok marketingcélokból történő megosztása során mindig a hatályos törvényeknek és jogszabályoknak megfelelően járunk el.
* **Tranzakciókkal kapcsolatos adattovábbítás**. Bizonyos tranzakciók során pénzügyi intézményekkel, kormányzati szervekkel, valamint a tranzakciók végrehajtásában érintett szállítmányozási vállalatokkal és postai szolgáltatókkal is megoszthatjuk az Ön egyes személyes adatait vagy valamennyi személyes adatát.
* **Felvásárlással vagy vállalatrész eladásával kapcsolatos adattovábbítás**. Előfordulhat, hogy a Honeywell stratégiai vagy üzleti célokból úgy dönt, hogy bizonyos országokban elad, megvásárol, leválaszt, egybeolvaszt vagy más módon átszervez egyes alvállalatokat. Ebben az esetben a Honeywell-vállalat eszközeinek egy részének vagy egészének egybeeolvasztásával, felvásárlásával, leválasztásával vagy eladásával járó tevékenységekkel kapcsolatos tárgyalások lebonyolításához, valamint az ilyen tevékenységek elvégzéséhez szükséges mértékben megoszthatjuk az Önről tárolt adatokat.
* **Adattovábbítás más okból**. Személyes adatait abban az esetben is továbbíthatjuk, ha ezt a törvények előírják vagy lehetővé teszik, valamint ha jóhiszeműen úgy véljük, hogy az adatok továbbítására törvényi kötelezettségeknek vagy jogi eljárásban született döntésnek való megfelelés, jogaink vagy vagyonunk védelme, valamint sürgős esetekben egy személy biztonságának védelme érdekében van szükség.

**Nemzetközi adattovábbítás**

A Honeywell globális vállalat, ezért az Ön személyes adatait a hatályos jogszabályoknak megfelelően világszerte különböző helyszínekre, például az Amerikai Egyesült Államokba, Mexikóba és Indiába továbbíthatjuk, így az Ön adatait ezekben az országokban is tárolhatjuk és felhasználhatjuk. Tehát az Öntől gyűjtött személyes adatokat olyan országokban is kezelhetjük, amelyek adatvédelmi jogszabályai eltérhetnek az Ön országában hatályos törvényektől. A Honeywell minden észszerűen elvárható lépést megtesz az Ön magánéletének és személyes adatainak megóvása érdekében, valamint hogy az Ön lakóhelye szerinti országhoz hasonló szintű védelmet biztosítson adatainak. Ennek részeként az Európai Bizottság által jóváhagyott általános szerződési feltételeket is alkalmazunk. A személyes adatok védelmét szolgáló intézkedésekkel kapcsolatos további tájékoztatásért írjon nekünk a [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com) e-mail-címre.

**Biztonság**

Elkötelezettek vagyunk személyes adatai védelme mellett. Technikai és szervezési intézkedéseket vezettünk be annak érdekében, hogy az adatkezelésben rejlő kockázatokhoz mérten megfelelő szintű biztonságot érjünk el. Ha szeretne többet megtudni arról, hogyan védi a Honeywell az Ön személyes adatait, írjon nekünk a [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com) e-mail-címre.

**Az Ön jogai**

A hatályos jogszabályoktól függően Önt bizonyos jogok illethetik meg személyes adataival kapcsolatban.

* Például jogosult lehet arra, hogy **hozzáférjen személyes adataihoz, valamint helyesbítse és frissítse őket**, vagy kérelmezze a **törlésüket**.
* Emellett **tiltakozhat** személyes adatainak feldolgozása ellen, kérheti, hogy **korlátozzuk** személyes adatainak feldolgozását, valamint az adatok **hordozhatóságával** kapcsolatos kérelmet is küldhet nekünk.
* Emellett joga lehet ahhoz, **hogy ne hozzanak Önről kizárólag automatizált adatkezelésen, például profilalkotáson alapuló döntést,** ha ez a döntés joghatással bír Önre, vagy jelentős mértékben érinti Önt.
* Emellett ha személyes adatait az Ön hozzájárulása alapján gyűjtöttük össze és kezeljük, akkor **Ön bármikor visszavonhatja a hozzájárulását**. A hozzájárulás visszavonása nem érinti a korábban végzett adatkezelés jogszerűségét, valamint nem befolyásolja azokat az adatkezelési tevékenységeket, amelyeket nem az Ön hozzájárulása alapján, hanem más jogalappal végzünk.
* Jogában áll úgy dönteni, hogy **nem engedélyezi személyes adatainak értékesítését**. A Honeywell nem értékesíti az Ön személyes adatait harmadik feleknek nyereség céljából Az Ön személyes adatait azonban bizonyos, a jelen Adatvédelmi nyilatkozatban és a [Cookie-kkal kapcsolatos közleményben](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/cookie-notice#hungarian) megadott esetekben megoszthatjuk harmadik felekkel, valamint harmadik feleknek továbbíthatjuk. Például harmadik felekkel együttműködve forgalmazzuk a termékeinket, műszaki segítséget nyújtunk Önnek, webhelyelemző eszközöket és funkciókat használunk, valamint különböző módszerekkel népszerűsítjük és értékesítjük termékeinket és szolgáltatásainkat. E tevékenységek során előfordulhat, hogy harmadik feleknek kell továbbítanunk az Ön személyes adatait, és egyes adatvédelmi törvények értelmében ez az adatok „értékesítésének” minősülhet.
* Önnek joga van **panaszt tenni** a joghatóságában hatályos adatvédelmi törvények betartásának felügyeletéért felelős adatvédelmi hatóságnál személyes adatainak gyűjtésével és felhasználásával kapcsolatban, ha úgy véli, hogy az adatkezelés során nem tartottuk be az adatvédelmi jogszabályokat. Az EGT területén élő magánszemélyek például panaszt tehetnek az illetékes adatvédelmi hatóságnál. E hatóságok listája a következő címen érhető el: [https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members\_en](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en). Nagyra értékelnénk azonban, ha lehetőséget adna nekünk, hogy mi foglalkozzunk az aggályaival. Ha panasza merül fel, vegye fel velünk bátran a kapcsolatot! Nem alkalmazunk hátrányos megkülönböztetést az adatvédelmi jogaikat gyakorló magánszemélyekkel szemben.

Minden esetben lehetővé tesszük, hogy Ön élhessen a hatályos törvények értelmében fennálló jogaival. Bizonyos esetekben még akkor is megpróbálunk eleget tenni az Ön adatkezelési tevékenységeinkkel kapcsolatos kéréséinek, ha az Ön személyes adatait nem védik az adatvédelmi törvények, vagy nem tartoznak az adatvédelmi törvények hatálya alá. Ha kérdése merül fel a jogaival kapcsolatban, vagy szeretné gyakorolni a jogait, írjon nekünk a [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com) e-mail-címre, vagy küldje el adatvédelemmel kapcsolatos kérdéseit az alábbi hivatkozáson elérhető interaktív webes űrlapon keresztül:

**Gyermekek adatai**

Webhelyeink nem tizenhat (16) éven aluli gyermekek számára készültek, és tudatosan nem gyűjtünk és nem is használunk fel adatokat ilyen személyekről, és nem értékesítjük ilyen személyek adatait. Ha Ön az országa törvényei szerint kiskorúnak minősül, ne adjon meg személyes adatokat a Webhelyeinken keresztül.

**Más webhelyekre mutató hivatkozások**

Webhelyeink harmadik felek webhelyeire, termékeire és szolgáltatásaira mutató hivatkozásokat tartalmazhatnak. Az ilyen webhelyekért, termékekért és szolgáltatásokért, valamint az általuk végzett adatgyűjtésért és -kezelésért nem vállalunk felelősséget.

Conformemente alla legislazione applicabile, siamo autorizzati a rendere anonimi i dati personali dell'utente affinché non possano più essere utilizzati per identificarlo. I dati resi anonimi non si classificano più come dati personali, pertanto non sono soggetti alla presente Informativa sulla privacy. Ci riserviamo il diritto di acquisire, utilizzare, aggregare e condividere dati in forma anonima per qualsiasi scopo.

**Durata della conservazione dei dati**

Il periodo durante il quale i dati personali dell'utente vengono conservati varia in base allo scopo per cui vengono trattati. Per esempio, conserviamo i dati personali necessari per fornire prodotti e servizi, o per agevolare le transazioni richieste, per tutto il tempo in cui l'utente è cliente di Honeywell o se presenta una domanda di assunzione tramite i nostri siti, conserviamo i dettagli della sua domanda come indicato nell'informativa sulla privacy messa a disposizione dell'utente in relazione alla sua candidatura o come altrimenti previsto a norma di legge. In tutti gli altri casi, Honeywell conserva i dati personali dell'utente per il tempo necessario ad adempiere alle finalità descritte nella presente Informativa sulla privacy. Al termine di tale periodo, i dati saranno resi anonimi (ove consentito dalla legislazione applicabile), eliminati o distrutti.

**Divulgazione dei dati**

Conformemente alla legislazione applicabile, siamo autorizzati a condividere i dati personali dell'utente con terzi selezionati, incluso quanto riportato di seguito:

* **Società del gruppo**. Siamo, inoltre, autorizzati a condividere i dati personali dell'utente con le nostre affiliate e con le società del gruppo Honeywell per le finalità descritte nella presente Informativa sulla privacy.
* **Fornitori di servizi**. Siamo autorizzati a condividere i dati personali dell'utente con le aziende che forniscono servizi per nostro conto, quali hosting di siti web, conduzione di sondaggi, elaborazione delle transazioni, analisi dei nostri siti e conduzione di analisi per migliorare la qualità dell'attività aziendale, dei nostri siti e dei prodotti e servizi offerti. Honeywell richiede a tali fornitori di servizi di tutelare la confidenzialità dei dati personali dell'utente.
* **Distributori e altri partner commerciali di fiducia**. Siamo autorizzati a condividere i dati personali dell'utente con i terzi incaricati della distribuzione dei nostri prodotti e con altri partner commerciali di fiducia per finalità che includono l'invio, da parte di tali terzi, di comunicazioni di marketing all'utente. Tale condivisione dei dati personali dell'utente per scopi di marketing verrà realizzata in conformità alle leggi e alle normative applicabili.
* **Divulgazione correlata alle transazioni**. In relazione a determinate transazioni, possiamo divulgare in parte o interamente i dati personali dell'utente a istituzioni finanziarie, enti governativi e società di spedizione o servizi postali coinvolti nell'adempimento della transazione.
* **Divulgazione in relazione ad acquisizioni o cessioni**. Possono verificarsi circostanze in cui, per ragioni strategiche o per altre ragioni commerciali, Honeywell decide di vendere, acquistare, cedere, fondere o riorganizzare diversamente le attività in alcuni paesi. Honeywell può divulgare i dati dell'utente che essa conserva nella misura necessaria e opportuna a continuare la trattativa o a completare una fusione, un'acquisizione, una cessione o una vendita di tutte le attività di Honeywell o di una loro parte.
* **Divulgazione per altre ragioni**. Ci riserviamo il diritto di divulgare dati personali se richiesto o consentito dalla legge o in caso di buona fede che tale procedura sia necessaria per rispondere a obblighi o procedure di legge, per proteggere e difendere i nostri diritti o proprietà o, in casi urgenti, per difendere la sicurezza personale di un individuo.

**Trasferimenti internazionali**

Honeywell è un'organizzazione globale e i dati personali degli utenti possono essere trasferiti, conservati, memorizzati o utilizzati in varie località del mondo, come gli Stati Uniti, il Messico e l'India, in conformità alle leggi vigenti. Ciò significa che, quando raccogliamo i vostri dati personali, questi possono essere trattati in paesi che possono avere leggi sulla protezione dei dati diverse da quelle del vostro paese. Tuttavia, Honeywell adotterà sempre le misure necessarie per tutelare la tua privacy e per fornire un livello di protezione dei dati personali paragonabile a quello del tuo paese di residenza, il che include l'attuazione delle clausole contrattuali tipo della Commissione europea. Per maggiori informazioni sulle misure di sicurezza appropriate in atto a protezione dei dati personali, contattateci all'indirizzo [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com).

**Sicurezza**

Abbiamo come priorità la tutela della sicurezza dei dati personali. Utilizziamo misure tecniche e organizzative per fornire un livello di sicurezza adeguato al rischio di trattamento dei dati personali.

**Diritti dell'utente**

A seconda della legge applicabile, l'utente può esercitare alcuni diritti in relazione ai propri dati personali.

* Può avere il diritto di **accedere, correggere, aggiornare** o **richiedere la cancellazione** dei propri dati personali.
* Può **opporsi** al trattamento dei propri dati personali, chiederci di **limitare** il trattamento dei propri dati personali o richiederne la **portabilità**.
* Ha il diritto **di non accettare che sia presa una decisione su di lui basata esclusivamente sull'elaborazione automatizzata, compresa la profilazione,** se tale decisione produce effetti giuridici sulla sua persona o la colpisce in modo significativo.
* Allo stesso modo, se abbiamo raccolto ed elaborato i dati personali con il suo consenso, l'utente può **ritirare il proprio consenso in qualsiasi momento**. La revoca del consenso non influirà sulla liceità di qualsiasi trattamento eseguito prima della revoca, né influenzerà il trattamento dei dati personali condotto facendo affidamento su criteri di liceità del trattamento diversi dal consenso.
* L'utente ha il diritto di **opporsi alla vendita dei propri dati personal**i. Honeywell si impegna a non vendere a terzi i dati personali degli utenti a scopo di lucro. Tuttavia, condividiamo o divulghiamo in altro modo i dati personali degli utenti a terze parti in conformità con la presente Informativa sulla privacy e la nostra [Informativa sui cookie](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/cookie-notice#italian). Per esempio, ci avvaliamo di società terze per distribuire i nostri prodotti, fornire assistenza tecnica, gestire strumenti e funzioni di analisi del sito web e svolgere attività di marketing e vendita dei nostri prodotti e servizi. Tali attività possono comportare la divulgazione dei dati personali a terzi e possono essere considerate una "vendita" di dati secondo alcune (ma non tutte) le leggi in materia di tutela dei dati.
* L'utente ha il diritto di **presentare reclamo** all'autorità preposta alla tutela dei dati personali, responsabile del controllo del rispetto della legge sulla sicurezza dei dati nella propria giurisdizione, in merito alla nostra acquisizione e all'utilizzo dei propri dati personali, qualora ritenga che il trattamento dei dati personali non sia conforme alla legge sulla loro tutela. Per esempio, gli individui residenti nel SEE hanno il diritto di presentare reclamo all'autorità competente per la protezione dei dati; l'elenco è consultabile all'indirizzo: [https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members\_en](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en). Tuttavia saremmo lieti di avere la possibilità di risolvere direttamente eventuali dubbi, pertanto invitiamo gli utenti a contattarci in relazione a qualsiasi motivo di insoddisfazione. Non opereremo alcuna discriminazione nei confronti degli individui che esercitano i loro diritti in materia di privacy.

Contribuiremo ad agevolare l'esercizio dei diritti dell'utente in conformità con la legge vigente. Tuttavia, anche se i vostri dati personali non sono protetti da una legge sulla tutela dei dati, o altrimenti soggetti a tale legge, possiamo cercare di soddisfare qualsiasi richiesta o istanza che possiate avanzare in merito alle nostre attività di trattamento dei dati. Per domande sui propri diritti o per esercitare i propri diritti, è possibile contattarci all'indirizzo [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com) o inviare domande sulla privacy tramite il nostro modulo web interattivo disponibile al seguente link:

**Vår innhenting av opplysninger**

* **Informasjon som samles inn direkte fra deg**. Vi kan be deg om personopplysninger for å yte en tjeneste eller utføre en transaksjon som du har bedt om. Du kan også gi oss personopplysninger når du tar kontakt med oss eller samhandler med oss (for eksempel med en kommentar, forespørsel eller kundesupportforespørsel, besøkende på nettsteder) eller registrerer deg for en konto for å bruke våre nettsteder. Disse personopplysningene kan omfatte:
    * **Identitetsdata,** for eksempel navn, tittel, firma/organisasjonsnavn, e-postadresse, telefonnummer og fysisk adresse (inkludert gate, by, postnummer og/eller land);
    * **Registreringsdata,** for eksempel informasjon gitt av deg når du registrerer deg for en konto for å bruke våre nettsteder, inkludert brukernavn og passord;
    * **Rekrutteringsopplysninger,** blant annet informasjon sendt inn i forbindelse med en søknad eller spørsmål om jobb (som beskrevet nedenfor);
    * **Bedriftskontaktdata,** for eksempel informasjon relatert til andre ansatte, eiere, styremedlemmer, funksjonærer eller leverandører i en tredjepartsorganisasjon (f.eks. virksomhet, selskap, partnerskap, enkeltmannsforetak, ideell organisasjon eller offentlig etat).
    * **Markedsførings- og kommunikasjonsdata,** inkludert markedsføringspreferanser og abonnementene i våre publikasjoner;
    * **Finansiell informasjon,** inkludert kredittkort eller annen finansiell kontoinformasjon, med det formål å gjøre det mulig for oss å legge til rette for kjøp av selskapets produkter og tjenester som kan være tilgjengelige på våre nettsteder;
    * **Informasjon om eksportkontroll,** for eksempel nasjonalitet, statsborgerskap og bostedsland, som gjør det mulig for oss å fastslå at du er kvalifisert under eksportkontrollforskrifter for å motta informasjon om visse teknologier;
    * **Transaksjonsdata,** blant annet henvendelser om og bestillinger for våre produkter og tjenester og detaljer om betalinger til og fra deg, inkludert innkjøpsordrehistorikk og informasjon som er nødvendig for å gjennomføre betalingstransaksjoner;
    * **Informasjon i forbindelse med hendelsesregistrering,** inkludert informasjon som du oppgir når du fyller ut e-registreringsskjemaer; og
    * **Din tilbakemelding,** inkludert tilbakemelding fra deg om nettstedet våre, samt produktene og tjenestene generelt.

Når du ikke oppgir forespurt informasjon, kan det hende vi ikke kan levere den tjenesten du ber om, eller utføre transaksjonen din.

* **Informasjon vi samler inn automatisk om deg**. Vi samler inn bestemt informasjon om ditt besøk på våre nettsteder ved hjelp av informasjonskapsler og lignende sporingsteknologier. Vi vil alltid respektere eventuelle juridiske rettigheter du måtte ha for å forhindre at vi gjør dette. Data som samles inn på denne måten, inkluderer:
    * **Bruksdata,** inkludert informasjon om hvordan du bruker våre nettsteder, hvilke sider du viser, antall byte som overføres, lenkene du klikker på, materialene du har tilgang til, datoen og klokkeslettet du får tilgang til nettstedet, nettstedet som du koblet videre til et av våre nettsteder fra, og andre handlinger på nettstedet; og
    * **Tekniske data,** for eksempel din IP-adresse, nettlesertype og -funksjoner og språk og operativsystem.

For informasjon om informasjonskapslene og andre lignende sporingsteknologier vi bruker på nettstedene våre, kan du se vår [merknad om informasjonskapsler](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/cookie-notice#norwegian).

* **Geolokasjonsinformasjon**. For bestemte nettsteder kan vi med uttrykkelig samtykke fra deg samle inn nøyaktige posisjonsopplysninger i sanntid (dvs. geolokasjon) for mobilenheten din. Denne informasjonen brukes bare for å lette din bruk av nettstedene, inkludert av tjenesteleverandørene våre som kan behandle denne informasjonen i forbindelse med å tilby tjenester på våre vegne. Hvis du har gitt det, kan du justere dette samtykket ved å administrere preferansene dine for posisjonstjenester gjennom innstillingene på mobilenheten din.
* **Informasjon samlet inn fra tredjeparter**. I samsvar med gjeldende lov kan vi samle inn personopplysninger om deg fra tredjeparter, for eksempel nettsteder og apper på sosiale medier, og kombinere dem med informasjon vi allerede har, for å hjelpe oss med å forbedre og tilpasse nettstedene dine etter dine preferanser og for andre formål som er angitt i denne personvernerklæringen. Vi kan også samle virksomhetens kontaktinformasjon fra arbeidsgiveren din eller andre tredjeparter for å legge til rette for eller på annen måte delta i tradisjonelle forretningsaktiviteter og lignende administrative spørsmål.

**Vår bruk av opplysninger**

Vi kan bruke den personlige informasjonen som er samlet inn via våre nettsteder, eller når du kontakter oss for formål som inkluderer:

* **Forretningskontaktdata**. Honeywell samler inn og bruker forretningskontaktdata for å delta i kommunikasjon eller transaksjoner, inkludert for å utføre due diligence om, eller levere eller motta, et produkt eller en tjeneste. For eksempel kan Honeywell samle inn og bruke disse forretningskontaktopplysningene for å tilrettelegge for og administrere bestillinger, kontrakter, garantier, vedlikehold og lignende forretningsfunksjoner, for kredittanalyse- og innkrevingsformål, for å bistå med vårt eget interne samsvar og juridiske krav, og (om nødvendig) for å forsvare våre interesser og krav.
* **Tjenester og transaksjoner**. Vi kan bruke personopplysningene dine til å levere deg tjenester og utføre transaksjoner du har bedt om, inklusiv, men ikke begrenset til, å gi informasjon om selskapets produkter, eller tjenester som du har kjøpt eller på annen måte bruker, registrere kjøpte produkter, behandle produktbestillinger, behandle garantikrav, erstatte produkthåndbøker, svare på kundeservicehenvendelser og forenkle bruken av nettstedene våre.
* **Administrere og beskytte vår virksomhet og nettsteder**. Vi kan bruke dine personlige opplysninger til å administrere og beskytte vår virksomhet og våre nettsteder, inkludert feilsøking, systemvedlikehold, brukerstøtte, rapportering og hosting av data.
* **Forbedre vår forretningsvirksomhet, nettsteder, produkter og tjenester**. Vi kan bruke dine personlige opplysninger til å utføre forretningsanalyser eller til andre formål som hjelper oss med å utvikle og forbedre kvaliteten på virksomheten vår, nettsteder, produkter og tjenester (inkludert nye produkter og tjenester), for eksempel ved å tilpasse våre nettsteder til dine spesielle preferanser eller interesser.
* **Markedsføring**. I samsvar med gjeldende lover og forskrifter kan vi bruke dine personopplysninger til å informere deg om produkter eller tjenester som kan være av interesse for deg, og ellers kommunisere med deg om tilbud, hendelser og nyheter, undersøkelser, spesialtilbud og relaterte emner. Du kan når som helst melde deg fra markedsføringskommunikasjon sendt via e-post, gratis ved å bruke "unsubscribe"-lenken i e-postmarkedsføringsmateriell du mottar fra oss, eller ved å kontakte oss ved å bruke kontaktopplysningene som er oppført i denne personvernerklæringen. Avhengig av bostedsland kan du også velge bort andre typer markedsføringskommunikasjon; kontakt oss ved hjelp av kontaktinformasjonen som er oppført i personvernerklæringen for mer informasjon. Noen jurisdiksjoner gir enkeltpersoner (for eksempel innbyggere i California) rett til å be om bestemt informasjon om vår utlevering av personopplysninger til tredjeparter for tredjepartens direkte markedsføringsformål. For mer informasjon om vår datapubliseringspraksis for markedsføringsformål kan du kontakte oss i samsvar med instruksjonene som er oppført nedenfor.
* **Interessebasert reklame**. Vi samler inn data om aktivitetene dine på nettet og identifiserer interessene dine slik at vi kan tilby reklame som er mest relevant for deg. Du kan velge å motta interessebasert reklame fra Honeywell som beskrevet i vår [merknad om informasjonskapsler](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/cookie-notice#norwegian).
* **Programmer for økonomisk insentiv og lojalitet**. Vi samler inn og bruker personopplysninger for å opprettholde og administrere våre programmer for økonomisk insentiv og lojalitet. Vi bruker personopplysningene du oppgir i disse programmene for å tilby unike belønninger, spore programstatusen din og for å tilrettelegge for utvekslingen av programpoeng i produkter, reklamemateriell, treningsverksteder og andre ting. I den grad loven tillater det, kan vi også bruke alle personopplysninger som du oppgir i forbindelse med et økonomisk insentivprogram til ethvert annet formål som er angitt i denne personvernerklæringen. Se gjennom vilkårene og betingelsene for hvert økonomisk insentivprogram du ønsker å registrere deg for eller delta i, ettersom slike vilkår kan være smalt tilpasset det aktuelle programmet. Hvis du samtykker i å delta i disse programmene, kan du når som helst trekke tilbake samtykket ved å kontakte oss ved å bruke kontaktinformasjonen på slutten av denne personvernerklæringen eller i samsvar med instruksjonene i det aktuelle programmets vilkår og betingelser.
* **Jobbsøknader**. I forbindelse med en jobbsøknad eller henvendelse kan du gi oss informasjon om deg selv, for eksempel CV, fagreferanser, informasjon om utdanning og jobbbakgrunn, og informasjon om fagopplæring og sertifiseringer. Vi og medlemmer av vår gruppe kan bruke denne informasjonen for å vurdere ansettelser, bakgrunnskontroll og ansettelseskvalifikasjon, og som det ellers er angitt i en hvilken som helst separat personvernerklæring eller annen merknad som er gjort tilgjengelig i forbindelse med søknaden din. Vi kan bruke en tredjepart (f.eks. rekrutteringsbyrå) eller plattform for sosiale medier for å be om, samle inn og beholde jobbsøknader. For mer informasjon kan du lese vår [Personvernerklæring for søkere](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/applicant-privacy-notice#norwegian).
* **Undersøkelser og analyser**. Vi kan bruke dine personopplysninger til å utføre forskning og analyse for å hjelpe oss med å analysere innkjøpspraksis, identifisere produktene og tjenestene som best passer dine krav, og måle effektiviteten av annonseringen vi leverer til deg.
* **Håndhevelse**: Vi kan bruke personopplysningene vi samler for å oppdage, forhindre og håndtere svindel, brudd på immaterielle rettigheter, brudd på våre vilkår og betingelser, lovbrudd eller annen misbruk av våre nettsteder.

Når loven tillater det, kan vi kombinere informasjonen vi samler inn via våre nettsteder med annen informasjon vi har om deg (for eksempel informasjon om din bruk av våre produkter og tjenester) for å tilby deg en bedre og konsistent kundeopplevelse når du samhandler med oss eller andre formål som er angitt i denne personvernerklæringen.

**Det rettslige grunnlaget for å behandle opplysninger**

Når loven krever det, sørger vi for at det er et rettslig grunnlag for behandlingen av dine personlige opplysninger. I de fleste tilfeller avhenger vårt juridiske grunnlag av de aktuelle personopplysningene og den spesifikke konteksten vi samler dem inn i.

* **Kontrakt**: behandlingen er nødvendig for utførelsen av tjenestene vi tilbyr deg, eller for å ta skritt (på din forespørsel) før utførelse av slike tjenester;
* **Juridisk forpliktelse**: behandlingen er nødvendig for å overholde våre juridiske forpliktelser, herunder overholdelse av gjeldende lover, forskrifter, statlige og kvasi-statlige forespørsler, rettsordre eller stevninger;
* **Samtykke**: behandlingen er basert på ditt samtykke til behandling av din personopplysninger for ett eller flere spesifiserte formål (for eksempel markedsføring);
* **Legitime interesser**: behandlingen er nødvendig for å møte våre legitime interesser, for eksempel for å utvikle og forbedre våre nettsteder, produkter og/eller tjenester til fordel for våre kunder; eller
* **Vitale interesser**: behandlingen er nødvendig for å beskytte dine vitale interesser (for eksempel helse- og sikkerhetsmessige grunner hvis du deltar på et møte på et Honeywell-sted).

Hvis du har spørsmål om eller trenger ytterligere informasjon om det juridiske grunnlaget som vi samler inn og bruker din personlige informasjon på, kan du sende en e-post til [HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com)

**Anonymisering av opplysninger**

I samsvar med gjeldende lov kan vi anonymisere dine personopplysninger slik at de ikke lenger kan brukes til å identifisere deg. Anonymisert informasjon anses ikke som personopplysninger og er derfor ikke underlagt denne personvernerklæringen. Vi kan samle inn, bruke, aggregere og dele anonymisert informasjon til ethvert formål.

**Hvor lenge vi lagrer opplysninger**

Perioden vi lagrer dine personopplysninger varierer avhengig av formålet med behandlingen. For eksempel lagrer vi personopplysninger som er nødvendige for å levere produkter og tjenester til deg, eller for å tilrettelegge for transaksjoner du har bedt om, så lenge du er kunde hos Honeywell, eller hvis du sender inn en jobbsøknad via våre nettsteder, vil vi beholde informasjon om søknaden din som beskrevet i personvernerklæringen som er tilgjengelig for deg i forbindelse med søknaden din eller som ellers kreves av loven. I alle andre tilfeller lagrer vi dine personlige opplysninger så lenge det er nødvendig for å oppfylle formålene som er angitt i denne personvernerklæringen, etter hvilken tid det er enten anonymisert (der det er tillatt ved gjeldende lov), slettet eller ødelagt.

**Utlevering av opplysninger**

Vi kan dele dine personopplysninger med utvalgte tredjeparter i samsvar med gjeldende lov, inkludert som angitt nedenfor:

* **Våre konsernselskaper**. Vi kan dele dine personopplysninger med våre tilknyttede selskaper og konsernselskaper som rimelig nødvendig for de formålene som er angitt i denne personvernerklæringen.
* **Tjenesteleverandører**. Vi kan dele dine personopplysninger med selskaper som vi har utkontraktert til å tilby tjenester på våre vegne, for eksempel hosting av nettsteder, gjennomføring av undersøkelser, behandlingstransaksjoner, analyse av våre nettsteder og utførelse av analyser for å forbedre kvaliteten på vår virksomhet, nettsteder, produkter og tjenester. Vi trenger disse tjenesteleverandørene for å beskytte konfidensialiteten til dine personopplysninger.
* **Distributører og andre pålitelige samarbeidspartnere**. Vi kan dele dine personlige opplysninger med tredjeparter som distribuerer våre produkter og andre pålitelige forretningspartnere til formål som inkluderer at disse tredjepartene kan sende markedsføringskommunikasjon til deg. Slik utveksling av personlig informasjon til markedsføringsformål blir utført i samsvar med gjeldende lover og forskrifter.
* **Utlevering i forbindelse med transaksjoner**. I forbindelse med visse transaksjoner kan det hende vi leverer videre noen av eller alle personopplysningene dine til finansinstitusjoner, myndighetsorganer og transport- eller postselskaper som er involvert i utførelsen av transaksjonen.
* **Opplysninger i forbindelse med oppkjøp eller frasalg**. Det kan oppstå forhold der Honeywell av strategiske eller andre forretningsgrunner bestemmer seg for å selge, kjøpe, selge, slå sammen eller på annen måte omorganisere virksomheter i noen land. Vi kan avsløre informasjon vi har om deg i den grad det er rimelig nødvendig for å fortsette med forhandling eller fullføring av fusjon, oppkjøp, avhendelse eller salg av hele eller deler av Honeywells eiendeler.
* **Utlevering av andre årsaker**. Det kan hende vi offentliggjør personopplysninger hvis nødvendig eller autorisert til å gjøre dette ifølge lov, eller når vi i god tro mener en slik handling er nødvendig for å etterleve juridiske krav, eller opptre riktig i forbindelse med søksmål mot oss, for å beskytte og forsvare våre rettigheter eller vår eiendom, eller for å beskytte den personlige sikkerheten til en person under presserende omstendigheter.

**Internasjonale overføringer**

Honeywell er en global organisasjon, og din personopplysningene dine kan overføres til, oppbevares, lagres eller brukes på forskjellige steder over hele verden som USA, Mexico og India i samsvar med gjeldende lov. Dette betyr at når vi samler inn personopplysningene dine, kan de bli behandlet i land som kan ha databeskyttelseslover som er forskjellige fra lovene i ditt land. Imidlertid vil Honeywell alltid ta rimelige tiltak for å beskytte personvernet ditt og for å gi et nivå av beskyttelse av personopplysninger som er sammenlignbar med den i bostedslandet ditt, inkludert implementering av EU-kommisjonens standardavtaleklausuler. For mer informasjon om hensiktsmessige tiltak for å beskytte personopplysningene dine kan du kontakte oss på [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com).

**Sikkerhet**

Vi er forpliktet til å verne personopplysninger om deg. Vi bruker tekniske og organisatoriske tiltak for å gi et sikkerhetsnivå som passer til risikoen for å behandle personopplysningene dine. For mer informasjon om hvordan Honeywell beskytter personopplysningene dine kan du kontakte oss på [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com)

**Dine rettigheter**

Avhengig av gjeldende lov kan du ha visse rettigheter med hensyn til personopplysningene dine.

* Du kan ha rett til å **få tilgang til, korrigere, oppdatere** eller **be om sletting** av personopplysningene dine.
* Du kan **protestere** mot behandlingen av personopplysningene dine, be oss om å **begrense** behandlingen av personopplysningene dine eller be om **portabilitet** av personopplysningene dine.
* Du kan ha rett **til at det ikke tas en beslutning om deg som bare er basert på automatisert behandling, inkludert profilering,** hvis avgjørelsen gir rettsvirkninger for deg eller påvirker deg betydelig.
* Tilsvarende, hvis vi har samlet inn og behandlet personopplysningene dine med ditt samtykke, **kan du når som helst trekke tilbake samtykket ditt**. Å trekke tilbake samtykket ditt vil ikke påvirke lovligheten av behandling vi har utført før du trakk det tilbake, og det vil heller ikke påvirke behandlingen av personopplysningene dine som er utført på annet lovlig behandlingsgrunnlag enn samtykke.
* Du kan ha rett til **å velge bort salg av personopplysningene dine**. Honeywell selger ikke personopplysningene dine til tredjeparter for fortjeneste. Imidlertid deler vi eller på annen måte avslører personopplysningene dine til tredjeparter i samsvar med denne personvernerklæringen og vår [Merknad om informasjonskapsler](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/cookie-notice#norwegian). For eksempel samarbeider vi med tredjeparter for å distribuere våre produkter, gi deg teknisk assistanse, bruke analyseverktøy og -funksjoner på nettstedet og delta i markedsføring og salg av våre produkter og tjenester. Slike aktiviteter kan innebære utlevering av personopplysningene dine til tredjepart og kan betraktes som et "salg" av data under visse (men ikke alle) lover om databeskyttelse.
* Du har rett til å **klage** til en databeskyttelsesmyndighet som er ansvarlig for å overvåke overholdelse av databeskyttelsesloven i din jurisdiksjon om vår innsamling og bruk av personopplysningene dine hvis du mener at behandlingen av personopplysningene dine ikke er i samsvar med databeskyttelsesloven. For eksempel har personer i EØS rett til å inngi en klage til den kompetente datatilsynsmyndigheten. Det finnes en liste over slike myndigheter på: [https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members\_en](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en). Vi vil imidlertid sette pris på muligheten til å løse dine bekymringer, så ikke nøl med å ta kontakt med oss hvis det er noe du vil klage på. Vi vil ikke diskriminere enkeltpersoner for å utøve sine personvernrettigheter.

Vi vil tilrettelegge utøvelsen av rettighetene som gjelder for deg i samsvar med gjeldende lov. Selv om personopplysningene dine ikke er gitt beskyttelse i henhold til eller på annen måte er underlagt en databeskyttelseslov, kan vi imidlertid søke å imøtekomme enhver forespørsel du måtte ha om våre databehandlingsaktiviteter. Hvis du har spørsmål om dine rettigheter eller ønsker å utøve dine rettigheter, kan du kontakte oss på [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com) eller sende personvernspørsmål via vårt interaktive webskjema på følgende lenke:

**Opplysninger fra barn**

Nettstedene våre er ikke rettet mot, og skal ikke brukes av, barn under seksten (16) år, og vi samler inn, bruker eller selger ikke bevisst informasjon fra slike personer. Hvis du er mindreårig i henhold til lovene i ditt land, må du ikke sende inn personopplysninger via våre nettsteder.

**Lenker til andre nettsteder**

Nettstedene våre kan inneholde lenker til tredjeparters nettsteder, produkter og tjenester. Vi har ikke noe erstatningsansvar eller annet ansvar for disse nettstedene, produktene og tjenestene, deres retningslinjer, eller deres samling eller annen behandling av dine personlige opplysninger. Fremgangsmåten til disse tredjepartene styres av deres egne personvernregler. Vi oppfordrer deg til å lære om personvernreglene til disse tredjepartene.

**Kontakt oss**

Hvis du har spørsmål om denne personvernerklæringen eller om vår håndtering av personopplysninger om deg, hvis du ønsker å levere en klage, eller hvis du ønsker å kontakte personvernombudet vårt, kan du kontakte oss via kontaktinformasjonen angitt nedenfor. Vi vil behandle spørsmålet ditt raskt og prøve å finne en tilfredsstillende løsning.

W niektórych Witrynach mogą być gromadzone w czasie rzeczywistym precyzyjne informacje o lokalizacji (geolokalizacji) urządzenia mobilnego użytkownika po uzyskaniu jego zgody. Informacje te będą wykorzystywane wyłącznie w celu ułatwienia użytkownikowi korzystania z Witryn, w tym przez naszych usługodawców, którzy mogą przetwarzać te dane w związku ze świadczeniem usług w naszym imieniu. Jeśli użytkownik udzieli wspomnianej zgody, może ją zmienić, zarządzając preferencjami usług lokalizacyjnych w ustawieniach urządzenia mobilnego.

Możemy również gromadzić dane kontaktowe firmy użytkownika od jego pracodawcy lub innych stron trzecich w celu ułatwienia prowadzenia tradycyjnej działalności gospodarczej i spraw administracyjnych o podobnym charakterze bądź angażowania się w nie w inny sposób.

**Wykorzystywanie danych**

Możemy wykorzystywać dane osobowe zgromadzone za pośrednictwem naszych Witryn lub podczas kontaktu użytkownika z nami w celach obejmujących:

* **Dane kontaktowe firmy**. Honeywell gromadzi i wykorzystuje dane kontaktowe firmy do komunikacji lub przeprowadzania transakcji, w tym w celu przeprowadzenia analizy due diligence w odniesieniu do produktu lub usługi bądź ich dostarczania lub uzyskania. Honeywell może na przykład gromadzić i wykorzystywać dane kontaktowe firmy w celu umożliwienia realizacji zamówień, umów, gwarancji, konserwacji i funkcji biznesowych o podobnym charakterze oraz zarządzania nimi, a także w celach analizy i windykacji kredytowej oraz wsparcia przestrzegania naszych wewnętrznych wymagań dotyczących zgodności z przepisami i wymogów prawnych oraz (jeśli to konieczne) obrony naszych interesów i roszczeń.

Możemy używać danych osobowych użytkownika w celu dostarczania mu żądanych usług oraz realizacji żądanych transakcji, w tym w celu dostarczania informacji na temat produktów i usług firmy, które użytkownik zakupił lub z których korzysta w jakikolwiek inny sposób, a także rejestracji zakupionych produktów, przetwarzania zamówień, obsługi roszczeń gwarancyjnych, wymiany instrukcji obsługi produktów, odpowiadania na zgłoszenia przesłane do działu obsługi klienta oraz ułatwiania procesu korzystania z naszych Witryn.
* **Zarządzanie naszą działalnością i Witrynami oraz ich ochrona**. Możemy wykorzystywać dane osobowe użytkownika w celu zarządzania naszą działalnością i Witrynami oraz ich ochrony, w tym rozwiązywania problemów, konserwacji systemu, udzielania wsparcia, raportowania i hostingu danych.

* **Marketing**. Zgodnie z obowiązującymi przepisami i regulacjami możemy wykorzystywać dane osobowe użytkownika w celu informowania go o produktach i usługach, którymi może być zainteresowany, oraz komunikowania się z nim w jakikolwiek inny sposób w sprawie naszych ofert, wydarzeń, aktualności, ankiet, ofert specjalnych i powiązanych tematów. Użytkownik może w dowolnym momencie bezpłatnie zrezygnować z otrzymywania wysyłanych pocztą e-mail materiałów marketingowych, klikając łącze rezygnacji z subskrypcji zamieszczone w otrzymanych od nas pocztą e-mail materiałach marketingowych lub kontaktując się z nami za pomocą informacji kontaktowych podanych w tym Oświadczeniu o ochronie prywatności. W zależności od kraju zamieszkania użytkownik może również zrezygnować z otrzymywania innych typów materiałów marketingowych; w celu uzyskania dalszych informacji prosimy o kontakt z nami za pomocą danych kontaktowych podanych w Oświadczeniu o ochronie prywatności. W niektórych jurysdykcjach osoby fizyczne (np. mieszkańcy Kalifornii) mają prawo żądać niektórych informacji dotyczących ujawniania danych osobowych osobom trzecim do celów ich marketingu bezpośredniego. Aby uzyskać więcej informacji na temat naszych praktyk w zakresie ujawniania danych w celach marketingowych, prosimy o kontakt z nami zgodnie z poniższymi instrukcjami.
* **Reklama oparta na zainteresowaniach**. Zbieramy dane o działaniach online użytkownika i ustalamy jego zainteresowania, aby móc mu udostępniać najbardziej odpowiednie dla niego reklamy. Użytkownik może zrezygnować z otrzymywania od firmy Honeywell reklam opartych na zainteresowaniach, jak opisano w naszych [Informacjach o plikach cookie](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/cookie-notice#polish).
* **Programy zachęt finansowych i programy lojalnościowe**. Gromadzimy i wykorzystujemy dane osobowe w celu prowadzenia programów zachęt finansowych i programów lojalnościowych oraz zarządzania nimi. Wykorzystujemy dane osobowe podawane w tych programach, aby oferować wyjątkowe nagrody, śledzić status programu i umożliwiać wymianę punktów w ramach programów na produkty, materiały promocyjne, warsztaty szkoleniowe i inne elementy. W zakresie dozwolonym przez prawo możemy również wykorzystywać wszelkie dane osobowe podane przez użytkownika w kontekście programu zachęt finansowych w jakimkolwiek innym celu określonym w niniejszym Oświadczeniu o ochronie prywatności. Prosimy o zapoznanie się z warunkami każdego programu zachęt finansowych, w którym użytkownik chce się zarejestrować lub uczestniczyć, ponieważ takie warunki mogą być ściśle dostosowane do danego programu. Jeśli użytkownik wyrazi zgodę na udział w takich programach, może ją wycofać w każdej chwili, kontaktując się z nami za pomocą danych kontaktowych podanych na końcu tego Oświadczenia o ochronie prywatności lub zgodnie z instrukcjami podanymi w warunkach danego programu.
* **Podania o pracę**. W związku z podaniem lub zapytaniem o pracę użytkownik może przekazać nam informacje o sobie, takie jak życiorys (CV), referencje zawodowe, informacje na temat wykształcenia i historii zatrudnienia oraz szkoleń zawodowych i certyfikatów. My i członkowie naszej grupy możemy wykorzystywać te informacje w celu rozpatrywania podań o pracę, weryfikacji historii zatrudnienia i kwalifikowania się użytkownika do zatrudnienia, a także w inny sposób określony w każdym odrębnym oświadczeniu o ochronie prywatności lub innych informacjach udostępnionych w związku z podaniem użytkownika. Możemy korzystać z usług osoby trzeciej (np. agencji rekrutacyjnej) lub platformy mediów społecznościowych w celu pozyskiwania, gromadzenia i przechowywania podań o pracę. Więcej informacji można uzyskać w naszym [Oświadczeniu o ochronie prywatności dla kandydatów do pracy](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/applicant-privacy-notice#polish).
* **Badania i analizy**. Możemy wykorzystywać dane osobowe użytkownika do prowadzenia badań i analiz, które pomogą nam analizować jego preferencje zakupowe, identyfikować produkty i usługi najlepiej odpowiadające jego wymaganiom oraz mierzyć skuteczność wyświetlanych mu reklam.
* **Egzekwowanie**. Możemy wykorzystywać zebrane przez nas dane osobowe w celach wykrywania oszustw, naruszeń praw własności intelektualnej i postanowień naszych warunków, naruszeń prawa lub innych przypadków niewłaściwego korzystania z naszych Witryn, a także zapobiegania takim oszustwom, naruszeniom i niewłaściwemu korzystaniu oraz reagowania na nie.

W zakresie dozwolonym przez prawo możemy łączyć dane gromadzone za pośrednictwem naszych Witryn z naszymi innymi danymi o użytkowniku (takimi jak informacje o korzystaniu przez niego z naszych produktów i usług) w celu zapewnienia mu lepszej i bardziej spójnej obsługi podczas interakcji z nami lub w innych celach określonych w tym Oświadczeniu o ochronie prywatności.

**Podstawa prawna przetwarzania danych**

Jeśli jest to wymagane przez prawo, upewniamy się, że istnieje podstawa prawna przetwarzania danych osobowych użytkownika. W większości przypadków nasza podstawa prawna będzie zależeć od danych osobowych i konkretnego kontekstu, w jakim je gromadzimy.

* **Umowa**: przetwarzanie jest niezbędne w celu świadczenia usług, które realizujemy na rzecz użytkownika, lub w celu podjęcia kroków (na żądanie użytkownika) przed wykonaniem takich usług i przewidując takie wykonanie;
* **Obowiązek prawny**: przetwarzanie danych jest konieczne w celu wypełnienia naszych zobowiązań prawnych, w tym przestrzegania obowiązujących przepisów i regulacji, nakazów rządowych i quasi-rządowych oraz zarządzeń sądu lub wezwań sądowych;
* **Zgoda**: przetwarzanie odbywa się w oparciu o wyrażoną przez użytkownika zgodę na przetwarzanie jego danych osobowych w jednym lub kilku określonych celach (np. marketingowych);
* **Uzasadnione interesy**: przetwarzanie jest konieczne do realizacji naszych uzasadnionych interesów, na przykład w celu rozwoju i doskonalenia naszych Witryn, produktów i/lub usług na rzecz naszych klientów; lub
* **Żywotne interesy**: przetwarzanie jest niezbędne do ochrony żywotnych interesów użytkownika (na przykład ze względu na zdrowie i bezpieczeństwo, jeśli użytkownik uczestniczy w spotkaniu w lokalizacji firmy Honeywell).

W razie jakichkolwiek pytań lub potrzeby uzyskania dalszych informacji na temat podstawy prawnej zbierania i wykorzystywania przez nas danych osobowych prosimy o wysłanie wiadomości e-mail na adres: [HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com)

**Anonimizacja danych**

Zgodnie z obowiązującymi przepisami możemy przeprowadzić anonimizację danych osobowych użytkownika, aby nie mogły być już wykorzystywane do celów jego identyfikacji. Zanonimizowane dane nie są uznawane za dane osobowe i dlatego nie podlegają niniejszemu Oświadczeniu o ochronie prywatności. Możemy gromadzić, wykorzystywać, agregować i udostępniać zanonimizowane dane w dowolnym celu.

**Czas przechowywania danych**

Okres przechowywania danych osobowych użytkownika różni się w zależności od celu przetwarzania. Na przykład przechowujemy dane osobowe niezbędne do dostarczania produktów i świadczenia usług lub ułatwiania realizowania transakcji żądanych przez użytkownika tak długo, jak będzie on klientem firmy Honeywell, lub jeśli złoży on podanie o pracę za pośrednictwem naszych Witryn, zachowamy informacje na temat tego podania przez czas określony w informacji o ochronie prywatności udostępnionej mu w związku z podaniem lub zgodnie z innymi wymogami prawa. We wszystkich innych przypadkach przechowujemy dane osobowe użytkownika tak długo, jak to jest konieczne do realizacji celów określonych w tym Oświadczeniu o ochronie prywatności. Po tym czasie są one anonimizowane (jeśli jest to dozwolone przez obowiązujące prawo), usuwane lub niszczone.

**Ujawnianie danych**

Możemy udostępniać dane osobowe użytkownika wybranym osobom trzecim zgodnie z obowiązującym prawem, w tym w sposób opisany poniżej:

* **Spółki wchodzące w skład naszej grupy**. Możemy udostępniać dane osobowe użytkownika naszym podmiotom stowarzyszonym i firmom należącym do grupy, gdy będzie to w uzasadnionym zakresie niezbędne do celów określonych w tym Oświadczeniu o ochronie prywatności.
* **Usługodawcy**. Możemy udostępniać dane osobowe użytkownika firmom, którym zleciliśmy świadczenie w naszym imieniu takich usług, jak hosting witryn internetowych, przeprowadzanie ankiet, przetwarzanie transakcji, analiza naszych Witryn i przeprowadzanie analiz w celu usprawnienia naszej działalności oraz udoskonalenia Witryn, produktów i usług. Wymagamy od tych usługodawców ochrony poufności danych osobowych użytkownika.
* **Dystrybutorzy i inni zaufani partnerzy biznesowi**. Możemy udostępniać dane osobowe użytkownika osobom trzecim zajmującym się dystrybucją naszych produktów i innym zaufanym partnerom biznesowym w celu umożliwienia im wysyłania materiałów marketingowych do użytkownika. Ten proces udostępniania danych osobowych w celach marketingowych będzie odbywać się zgodnie z obowiązującymi przepisami i regulacjami prawnymi.
* **Ujawnianie danych w związku z transakcjami**. W związku z niektórymi transakcjami możemy ujawniać niektóre lub wszystkie dane osobowe użytkownika instytucjom finansowym, podmiotom rządowym oraz firmom wysyłkowym i poczcie, które biorą udział w realizacji transakcji.
* **Ujawnianie danych związane z transakcjami przejęcia lub zbycia**. W niektórych okolicznościach ze względów strategicznych lub innych powodów biznesowych firma Honeywell może podjąć decyzję o sprzedaży, zakupie, zbyciu, fuzji lub innej reorganizacji działalności w niektórych krajach. Możemy ujawniać przechowywane przez nas dane użytkownika w uzasadnionym zakresie koniecznym do prowadzenia negocjacji lub realizacji fuzji, przejęcia, zbycia lub sprzedaży całości bądź części aktywów firmy Honeywell.
* **Ujawnianie danych z innych powodów**. Możemy ujawniać dane osobowe, gdy wymaga tego prawo lub w dobrej wierze, że takie działanie jest niezbędne w celu przestrzegania wymogów prawnych lub prowadzonych wobec nas procesów prawnych, w celu ochrony i obrony naszych praw lub mienia, bądź w szczególnych okolicznościach w celu ochrony osobistego bezpieczeństwa dowolnej osoby.

**Międzynarodowe transfery danych**

Honeywell jest firmą globalną i dane osobowe użytkownika mogą być przekazywane do różnych krajów na całym świecie, takich jak Stany Zjednoczone, Meksyk i Indie, a także przechowywane lub wykorzystywane w takich krajach zgodnie z obowiązującym prawem. Oznacza to, że gdy gromadzimy dane osobowe użytkownika, mogą być one przetwarzane w krajach, w których mogą obowiązywać przepisy o ochronie danych różniące się od przepisów kraju użytkownika. Firma Honeywell zawsze podejmie jednak uzasadnione kroki w celu ochrony prywatności użytkownika i zapewnienia mu poziomu ochrony danych osobowych porównywalnego z poziomem ochrony w kraju jego zamieszkania, co obejmuje wdrożenie standardowych klauzul umownych Komisji Europejskiej. Aby uzyskać więcej informacji na temat odpowiednich zabezpieczeń stosowanych w celu ochrony danych osobowych, prosimy o skontaktowanie się z nami pod adresem: [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com).

**Bezpieczeństwo**

Zobowiązujemy się do ochrony bezpieczeństwa danych osobowych użytkowników. Stosujemy środki techniczne i organizacyjne, aby zapewnić poziom bezpieczeństwa odpowiedni do ryzyka przetwarzania danych osobowych użytkownika. Aby uzyskać więcej informacji na temat ochrony danych osobowych przez firmę Honeywell, prosimy o skontaktowanie się z nami pod adresem [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com)

**Prawa użytkownika**

W zależności od obowiązujących przepisów użytkownik może mieć określone prawa w odniesieniu do swoich danych osobowych.

* Użytkownik może mieć prawo **dostępu do swoich danych osobowych, ich poprawiania lub aktualizowania** lub **żądania ich usunięcia.**
* Użytkownik może **wyrazić sprzeciw** wobec przetwarzania swoich danych osobowych, zażądać od nas **ograniczenia** przetwarzania jego danych osobowych lub ich **przeniesienia**.
* Użytkownik może mieć prawo **do tego, aby nie podejmowano dotyczącej go decyzji w oparciu o wyłącznie zautomatyzowane przetwarzanie, w tym profilowanie,** jeśli taka decyzja wywołuje skutki prawne dotyczące użytkownika lub znacząco na niego wpływa.
* Podobnie, jeśli dane użytkownika zostały zebrane i są przetwarzane przez nas za jego zgodą, wówczas **może on w każdej chwili wycofać swoją zgodę**. Wycofanie zgody nie będzie miało wpływu na zgodność z prawem przetwarzania prowadzonego wcześniej ani nie wpłynie na przetwarzanie danych osobowych użytkownika w oparciu o zgodne z prawem podstawy przetwarzania inne niż zgoda.
* Użytkownik może mieć prawo do **rezygnacji ze sprzedaży swoich danych osobowych**. Firma Honeywell nie sprzedaje danych osobowych użytkowników osobom trzecim w celach zarobkowych. Udostępniamy jednak lub w inny sposób ujawniamy dane osobowe użytkowników osobom trzecim zgodnie z tym Oświadczeniem o ochronie prywatności i [Informacjami o plikach cookie](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/cookie-notice#polish). Na przykład współpracujemy z osobami trzecimi w celu dystrybucji naszych produktów, świadczenia użytkownikom pomocy technicznej, obsługi narzędzi i funkcji analitycznych w witrynie internetowej, a także prowadzenia marketingu i sprzedaży naszych produktów i usług. Takie działania mogą wiązać się z ujawnianiem danych osobowych użytkownika osobom trzecim i zgodnie z niektórymi (ale nie wszystkimi) przepisami o ochronie danych mogą być uznawane za „sprzedaż” danych.
* Użytkownik ma prawo **złożyć skargę** do organu ds. ochrony danych odpowiedzialnego za nadzór nad przestrzeganiem przepisów o ochronie danych w jurysdykcji użytkownika w związku z gromadzeniem i wykorzystywaniem przez nas jego danych osobowych, jeśli uzna, że nie jest ono zgodne z przepisami o ochronie danych. Na przykład osoby fizyczne w EOG mają prawo złożyć skargę do właściwego organu ds. ochrony danych; wykaz takich organów jest dostępny pod adresem: [https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members\_en](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en). Mamy jednak nadzieję, że zanim to nastąpi, użytkownik da nam szansę na rozwiązanie wszelkich zgłoszonych przez niego problemów, dlatego prosimy o kontakt w sprawie jakiejkolwiek ewentualnej skargi. Nie będziemy dyskryminować żadnych osób fizycznych w związku z korzystaniem przez nie z ich praw do ochrony danych.

Ułatwimy użytkownikowi korzystanie z praw, które mają do niego zastosowanie zgodnie z obowiązującym prawem. Jednak nawet jeśli dane osobowe użytkownika nie są chronione na mocy przepisów o ochronie danych lub nie podlegają im z innej przyczyny, możemy postarać się zrealizować wszelkie żądania lub zapytania, jakie użytkownik może mieć w związku z naszymi działaniami dotyczącymi przetwarzania danych. W razie pytań dotyczących praw użytkownika lub chęci ich wykonania prosimy o skontaktowanie się z nami pod adresem [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.co](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com)m lub o przesłanie pytań dotyczących prywatności za pośrednictwem naszego interaktywnego formularza online dostępnego po kliknięciu poniższego łącza:

**Dane dzieci**

Nasze Witryny nie są przeznaczone dla dzieci poniżej szesnastego (16.) roku życia i nie powinny one z nich korzystać, a my świadomie nie gromadzimy, nie wykorzystujemy ani nie sprzedajemy danych takich osób. Jeśli użytkownik jest osobą niepełnoletnią zgodnie z prawem obowiązującym w jego kraju, prosimy o nieprzekazywanie żadnych danych osobowych za pośrednictwem naszych Witryn.

**Łącza do innych witryn internetowych**

Nasze Witryny mogą zawierać łącza do witryn internetowych, produktów i usług osób trzecich. Nie ponosimy żadnej odpowiedzialności za te witryny internetowe, produkty, usługi i obowiązujące w nich zasady ani za gromadzenie w nich lub przetwarzanie w inny sposób danych osobowych użytkownika. Praktyki tych osób trzecich podlegają ich własnym zasadom ochrony prywatności. Zachęcamy do zapoznania się z zasadami ochrony prywatności tych osób trzecich.

**Kontakt z nami**

W razie pytań dotyczących tego Oświadczenia o ochronie prywatności lub naszego postępowania z danymi osobowymi, chęci złożenia skargi lub skontaktowania się z naszym inspektorem ochrony danych należy skontaktować się z nami za pomocą podanych niżej danych kontaktowych. Niezwłocznie odniesiemy się do zgłoszonych kwestii i będziemy dążyć do pomyślnego rozstrzygnięcia sprawy.

**Анонимизация данных**

В соответствии с применимым законодательством мы можем обеспечивать анонимность персональных данных, чтобы их невозможно было использовать для идентификации личности. Анонимизированные данные не считаются персональными данными и поэтому не попадают под действие настоящего Заявления о конфиденциальности. Мы можем собирать, использовать, объединять и передавать анонимную информацию в любых целях.

**Сроки хранения данных**

Период хранения персональных данных зависит от цели обработки. Например, мы храним персональные данные, необходимые для предоставления вам продуктов и услуг или для выполнения запрашиваемых вами транзакций, пока вы являетесь клиентом компании Honeywell. Если вы подаете заявление о приеме на работу через наши веб-сайты, мы будем хранить информацию о вашем заявлении, как указано в уведомлении о конфиденциальности, предоставленном вам в связи с вашим заявлением, или в соответствии с требованиями закона. Во всех других случаях мы храним персональные данные до тех пор, пока они необходимы для наших целей, изложенных в настоящем Заявлении о конфиденциальности, после чего мы либо анонимизируем данные (если это разрешено применимым законодательством), либо удаляем, либо уничтожаем их.

**Раскрытие данных**

Мы можем передавать ваши персональные данные выбранным третьим лицам в соответствии с применимым законодательством, в том числе, как указано ниже.

Мы требуем, чтобы эти поставщики услуг обеспечивали конфиденциальность ваших персональных данных.
* **Дистрибьюторы и другие доверенные деловые партнеры**. Мы можем передавать ваши персональные данные третьим лицам, которые распространяют наши продукты, и другим доверенным деловым партнерам в целях, позволяющих этим третьим лицам отправлять вам рекламные материалы. Предоставление персональных данных в маркетинговых целях осуществляется в соответствии с применимыми законами и нормами.
* **Предоставление информации в связи со сделками**. В связи с некоторыми сделками мы можем сообщить некоторую часть или все ваши персональные данные финансовым учреждениям, правительственным организациям и транспортным компаниям, а также почтовым службам, привлеченным к осуществлению сделки.
* **Разглашение в связи с приобретением или ликвидацией компании**. В связи с обстоятельствами в стратегических целях или по иным деловым соображениям корпорация Honeywell может решить продать, купить, разделить, объединить посредством слияния или иначе реорганизовать свои предприятия в некоторых странах. Мы можем раскрыть имеющуюся о вас информацию до степени, достаточной для продолжения переговоров или завершения слияния, приобретения, разделения или продажи всех или части активов компании Honeywell.
* **Разглашение информации по другим причинам**. Мы можем раскрыть персональные данные, если это требуется или разрешено по закону или исходя из добросовестного предположения, что такое действие необходимо для соблюдения законных требований или врученного нам постановления суда, для защиты наших прав и имущества или в чрезвычайных обстоятельствах для защиты личной безопасности того или иного физического лица.

**Передача данных в другие страны**

Компания Honeywell является глобальной организацией, и ваши персональные данные могут передаваться, находиться, храниться или использоваться в различных регионах по всему миру, например в США, Мексике и Индии, в соответствии с действующим законодательством. Это означает, что когда мы собираем ваши персональные данные, они могут обрабатываться в странах, в которых законы о защите данных могут отличаться от законов вашей страны. Тем не менее, компания Honeywell всегда будет принимать разумные меры для защиты вашей конфиденциальности и обеспечения уровня защиты персональных данных, сопоставимого с уровнем защиты в вашей стране проживания, включая выполнение Стандартных договорных положений, утвержденных Европейской комиссией. Чтобы получить дополнительную информацию о соответствующих мерах защиты ваших персональных данных, свяжитесь с нами по адресу [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com).

**Anonymizácia údajov**

V súlade s platnými právnymi predpismi môžeme anonymizovať vaše osobné údaje tak, aby ich nebolo možné použiť na vašu identifikáciu. Anonymizované údaje sa nepovažujú za osobné údaje, a preto sa na ne nevzťahuje toto vyhlásenie o ochrane osobných údajov. Anonymizované údaje môžeme zhromažďovať, používať, agregovať a zdieľať na akýkoľvek účel.

**Ako dlho uchovávame údaje**

Doba uchovávania vašich osobných údajov sa líši v závislosti od účelu ich spracúvania. Napríklad osobné údaje potrebné na to, aby sme vám mohli poskytovať produkty a služby alebo umožňovať vykonávanie požadovaných transakcií, uchovávame tak dlho, kým budete zákazníkmi spoločnosti Honeywell, alebo ak prostredníctvom našich webových lokalít podáte žiadosť o zamestnanie, podrobné informácie o vašej žiadosti budeme uchovávať po dobu stanovenú v tomto oznámení o ochrane osobných údajov, ktoré vám poskytneme v súvislosti s vašou žiadosťou alebo inak v súlade s právnymi predpismi. Vo všetkých ostatných prípadoch uchovávame vaše osobné údaje dovtedy, kým to bude potrebné na splnenie účelov uvedených v tomto vyhlásení o ochrane osobných údajov. Po uplynutí tejto doby budú buď anonymizované (ak to umožňujú platné právne predpisy), odstránené, alebo zničené.

**Zverejňovanie údajov**

Vaše osobné údaje môžeme zdieľať s vybratými tretími stranami v súlade s platnými právnymi predpismi vrátane podmienok stanovených nižšie:

* **Spoločnosti z našej skupiny**. Vaše osobné údaje môžeme zdieľať s našimi pridruženými spoločnosťami a spoločnosťami z našej skupiny, ak na to existujú primerané účely, ktoré sú stanovené v tomto vyhlásení o ochrane osobných údajov.
* **Poskytovatelia služieb**. Vaše osobné údaje môžeme zdieľať so spoločnosťami, s ktorými máme uzatvorenú zmluvu o poskytovaní služieb v našom mene, ako sú napríklad služby hosťovania webových lokalít, vykonávanie prieskumov, spracúvanie transakcií, analyzovanie našich webových lokalít a vykonávanie analýz na zlepšovanie kvality nášho podnikania, našich webových lokalít, produktov a služieb. Od týchto poskytovateľov služieb vyžadujeme, aby vaše osobné údaje chránili ako dôverné.
* **Distribútori a ďalší dôveryhodní obchodní partneri**. Vaše osobné údaje môžeme zdieľať s tretími stranami, ktoré distribuujú naše produkty, ako aj s ďalšími dôveryhodnými obchodnými partnermi, aby sme im umožnili napríklad posielať vám marketingové oznámenia. Takéto zdieľanie osobných údajov na marketingové účely sa bude vykonávať v súlade s platnými právnymi predpismi a nariadeniami.
* **Zverejňovanie v súvislosti s transakciami**. V spojení s určitými transakciami môžeme zverejniť časť alebo všetky osobné údaje finančným inštitúciám, štátnym subjektom, zásielkovým spoločnostiam alebo poštovým službám s cieľom uskutočnenia transakcie.
* **Zverejňovania v súvislosti s akvizíciami alebo odpredajmi**. Naša spoločnosť Honeywell sa za určitých okolností môže zo strategických alebo iných obchodných dôvodov rozhodnúť v niektorých krajinách predať, kúpiť, odpredať, vykonať zlúčenie alebo iným spôsobom reorganizovať svoje podniky. Informácie, ktoré o vás uchovávame, môžeme zverejniť v primeranom rozsahu potrebnom na vyjednanie alebo realizáciu zlúčenia, akvizície, odpredaja alebo predaja všetkého majetku spoločnosti Honeywell alebo jeho časti.
* **Zverejňovanie z iných dôvodov**. Osobné údaje môžeme zverejniť, ak to vyžadujú alebo ak nás k tomu oprávňujú právne predpisy, alebo ak to urobíme v dobrej viere, že je to nutné na splnenie zákonných požiadaviek alebo právneho procesu vedenému voči nám, na ochranu a obranu našich práv alebo majetku alebo v naliehavých prípadoch na ochranu bezpečnosti osôb.

**Medzinárodné prenosy**

Spoločnosť Honeywell je globálna organizácia a vaše osobné údaje môžu byť v súlade s platnými právnymi predpismi prenášané, uchovávané, ukladané alebo používané na rôznych miestach po celom svete, ako sú napríklad USA, Mexiko a India. To znamená, že keď zhromažďujeme vaše osobné údaje, môžu byť spracované v krajinách, ktorých právne predpisy o ochrane údajov sa môžu líšiť od právnych predpisov vo vašej krajine. Spoločnosť Honeywell však vždy podnikne primerané kroky na ochranu vášho súkromia a na zabezpečenie úrovne ochrany osobných údajov, ktorá je porovnateľná s úrovňou vo vašej krajine pobytu, ktoré zahŕňajú implementáciu štandardných zmluvných doložiek Európskej komisie.

**Vaše práva**

V závislosti od platných právnych predpisov môžete mať určité práva týkajúce sa vašich osobných údajov.

* Môžete mať právo **pristupovať, kontrolovať, aktualizovať** alebo **požiadať o odstránenie** vašich osobných údajov.
* Môžete **namietať** proti spracovaniu vašich osobných údajov, požiadať nás **obmedziť** spracovanie vašich osobných údajov alebo požiadať **o prenosnosť** vašich osobných údajov.

* Podobne, ak sme zhromaždili a spracovali vaše osobné údaje s vašim súhlasom, potom **svoj súhlas môžete kedykoľvek odvolať**. Odvolanie súhlasu neovplyvní zákonnosť spracovania, ktoré sme vykonali pred vašim odvolaním, ani to neovplyvní spracovanie vašich osobných údajov, ktoré sa vykonáva na základe iných zákonných dôvodov ako je súhlas.
* Môžete mať právo **odhlásiť sa z predaja vašich osobných údajov**. Spoločnosť Honeywell nepredáva vaše osobné údaje tretím stranám pre zisk.

S tretími stranami napríklad spolupracujeme pri distribúcii našich produktov, poskytovaní technickej pomoci pre vás, prevádzkovaní analytických nástrojov a funkcií webových lokalít a zaoberáme sa marketingom a predajom našich produktov a služieb. Takéto činnosti môžu zahŕňať zverejňovanie vašich osobných údajov tretím stranám a podľa určitých (ale nie všetkých) právnych predpisov na ochranu údajov sa môžu považovať za „predaj“ údajov.
* Máte právo **sťažovať sa** orgánu na ochranu údajov zodpovednému za dohľad nad dodržiavaním právnych predpisov o ochrane údajov vo vašej jurisdikcii na naše zhromažďovanie a používanie vašich osobných údajov, ak sa domnievate, že spracovanie vašich osobných údajov nie je v súlade s právnymi predpismi o ochrane údajov.

**Transferencias internacionales**

Honeywell es una empresa global y su información personal puede ser transferida, conservada, almacenada y utilizada en diferentes ubicaciones de todo el mundo, como Estados Unidos, México y la India de acuerdo con la ley aplicable.

Por ejemplo, nos relacionamos con terceros para distribuir nuestros productos, proporcionarle asistencia técnica, operar herramientas y funciones analíticas de sitios web, y participar en el marketing y las ventas de nuestros productos y servicios. Estas actividades pueden implicar la revelación de su información personal a terceros y puedes ser consideradas "ventas" de datos según ciertas (pero no todas) leyes de protección de datos.
* Tiene derecho a **reclamar** ante una autoridad de protección de datos responsable de supervisar el cumplimiento de la ley de protección de datos en su jurisdicción sobre nuestra recopilación y uso de su información personal si cree que nuestro procesamiento de su información personal no cumple con la ley de protección de datos.

* **Marknadsföring.** I enlighet med tillämpliga lagar och förordningar kan vi använda din personliga information för att informera dig om produkter eller tjänster som kan vara av intresse för dig och för att på annat sätt kommunicera med dig om erbjudanden, evenemang och nyheter, undersökningar, specialerbjudanden och relaterade ämnen. Du kan när som helst och utan kostnad välja bort marknadsföringskommunikation som skickas via e-post genom att använda länken ”avanmälan” i något av det marknadsföringsmaterial du får från oss via e-post, eller genom att kontakta oss med hjälp av kontaktinformationen som anges i denna sekretesspolicy. Beroende på i vilket land du bor kan du också välja bort andra typer av marknadsföringskommunikation; vänligen kontakta oss med hjälp av kontaktinformationen i sekretesspolicyn för mer information. Vissa jurisdiktioner ger individer (t.ex. invånare i Kalifornien) rätten att begära viss information om vår utlämning av personlig information till tredje part för tredje parts direkta marknadsföringsändamål. Kontakta oss enligt instruktionerna nedan för mer information om vår praxis gällande utlämning av uppgifter för marknadsföringsändamål.

Vi använder den personliga informationen du tillhandahåller i dessa program för att erbjuda unika belöningar, spåra din programstatus och för att underlätta utbytet av programpoäng för produkter, reklammaterial, utbildningsworkshops och andra objekt. I den utsträckning som lagen tillåter kan vi också använda all personlig information som du tillhandahåller i samband med ett program med ekonomiska incitament för något annat syfte som anges i denna sekretesspolicy. Det är viktigt att du läser igenom villkoren för varje program med ekonomiska incitament som du vill registrera dig eller delta i eftersom dessa villkor kan vara mycket specifikt anpassade till det tillämpliga programmet. Om du samtycker till att delta i något av dessa program kan du när som helst dra tillbaka ditt samtycke genom att kontakta oss via kontaktuppgifterna i denna sekretesspolicy eller i enlighet med instruktionerna som anges i de tillämpliga villkoren.

* **Tillämpning:** Vi kan använda den personliga informationen vi samlar in för att upptäcka, förhindra och svara på bedrägerier, intrång i immateriella rättigheter, brott mot våra villkor, överträdelser av lag eller annat missbruk av våra webbplatser.

Där lagen tillåter kan vi kombinera informationen som vi samlar in via våra webbplatser med annan information som vi har om dig (så som information om din användning av våra produkter och tjänster) för att erbjuda dig en förbättrad och konsekvent kundupplevelse när du interagerar med oss eller för andra ändamål som anges i denna sekretesspolicy.

**Den rättsliga grunden på vilken vi behandlar information**

Där det krävs enligt lag kommer vi att se till att det finns en rättslig grund för behandlingen av din personliga information. I de flesta fall beror vår rättsliga grund på berörd personlig information och det specifika sammanhang där vi samlar in den.

* **Kontrakt:** behandlingen är nödvändig för utförandet av de tjänster vi tillhandahåller dig, eller för att vidta åtgärder (på din begäran) före utförandet, och vid förväntan att utföra, sådana tjänster;
* **Juridisk skyldighet:** behandlingen är nödvändig för att uppfylla våra juridiska skyldigheter, inklusive efterlevnad av tillämpliga lagar, förordningar, statliga och kvasistatliga begäranden, domstolsbeslut eller stämningar;
* **Samtycke:** behandlingen baseras på ditt samtycke till behandlingen av din personliga information för ett eller flera specifika ändamål (t.ex. marknadsföring);
* **Legitima intressen:** behandlingen är nödvändig för att tillgodose våra legitima intressen, till exempel för att utveckla och förbättra våra webbplatser, produkter och/eller tjänster till förmån för våra kunder; eller
* **Vitala intressen:** behandlingen är nödvändig för att skydda dina vitala intressen (till exempel hälso- och säkerhetsskäl om du deltar i ett möte på en Honeywell-plats).

Om du har några frågor eller behöver ytterligare information om den rättsliga grund på vilken vi samlar in och använder din personliga information, skicka ett e-postmeddelande till [HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:HoneywellPrivacy@honeywell.com).

**Anonymisering av information**

I enlighet med tillämplig lag kan vi anonymisera din personliga information så att den inte längre kan användas för att identifiera dig. Anonymiserad information anses inte vara personlig information och omfattas därför inte av denna sekretesspolicy. Vi kan samla in, använda, aggregera och dela anonymiserad information för alla syften.

**Hur länge vi behåller uppgifter**

Perioden under vilken vi lagrar din personliga information varierar beroende på syftet med behandlingen. Vi lagrar till exempel personlig information som behövs för att förse dig med produkter och tjänster, eller för att underlätta transaktioner du har begärt, så länge du är kund hos Honeywell eller om du skickar in en jobbansökan via våra webbplatser kommer vi att behålla information om din ansökan enligt beskrivningen i sekretessmeddelandet som görs tillgängligt för dig i samband med din ansökan eller på annat sätt krävs enligt lag. I alla andra fall lagrar vi din personliga information så länge som behövs för att uppfylla de syften som beskrivs i denna sekretesspolicy, varefter den antingen anonymiseras (där det är tillåtet enligt tillämplig lag), raderas eller förstörs.

**Utlämning av information**

Vi kan dela din personliga information med utvalda tredje parter i enlighet med tillämplig lag, inklusive enligt vad som anges nedan:

* **Våra koncernföretag.** Vi kan dela din personliga information med våra dotterbolag och koncernföretag enligt vad som är rimligt nödvändigt för de ändamål som anges i denna sekretesspolicy.
* **Tjänsteleverantörer.** Vi kan dela din personliga information med företag som vi har ingått avtal med att tillhandahålla tjänster för vår räkning, så som att vara värd för webbplatser, genomföra undersökningar, behandla transaktioner, analysera våra webbplatser och utföra analyser för att förbättra kvaliteten på vår verksamhet, webbplatser, produkter och tjänster. Vi kräver att dessa tjänsteleverantörer skyddar din personliga informations konfidentialitet.
* **Distributörer och andra betrodda affärspartner.** Vi kan dela din personliga information med tredje part som distribuerar våra produkter och andra betrodda affärspartner för ändamål som inkluderar att dessa tredje parter kan skicka marknadsföringskommunikation till dig. Sådan delning av personlig information för marknadsföringsändamål kommer att ske i enlighet med tillämpliga lagar och regler.
* **Utlämning i samband med transaktioner.** I samband med vissa transaktioner kan vi lämna ut någon eller all din personliga information till finansinstitut, statliga enheter och rederier eller posttjänster som är involverade i genomförandet av transaktionen.
* **Utlämningar i samband med förvärv eller avyttringar.** Omständigheter kan uppstå om Honeywell av strategiska eller andra affärsskäl beslutar att sälja, köpa, avyttra, slå samman eller på annat sätt omorganisera företag i vissa länder. Vi kan lämna ut information som vi har om dig i den utsträckning som är rimligt nödvändigt för att fortsätta med förhandlingarna eller slutförandet av en sammanslagning, förvärv, avyttring eller försäljning av hela eller en del av Honeywells tillgångar.
* **Utlämning av andra skäl.** Vi kan lämna ut personlig information om detta krävs eller bemyndigas enligt lag eller i god tro och det är nödvändigt för att följa rättsliga krav eller för en juridisk process som delges oss, för att skydda och försvara våra rättigheter eller egendom, under brådskande omständigheter, för att skydda varje individs personliga säkerhet.

**Internationella överföringar**

Honeywell är en global organisation och din personliga information kan överföras till, förvaras, lagras eller användas över olika platser världen över, så som USA, Mexiko och Indien i enlighet med tillämplig lag. Detta innebär att när vi samlar in din personliga information kan den behandlas i länder som kan ha dataskyddslagar som skiljer sig från lagarna i ditt land. Honeywell kommer dock alltid att vidta rimliga åtgärder för att skydda din integritet och för att tillhandahålla en skyddsnivå för personlig information som är jämförbar med den i ditt bosättningsland, inklusive implementering av Europeiska kommissionens standardavtalsklausuler. För mer information om lämpliga skyddsåtgärder för att skydda din personliga information, vänligen kontakta oss på [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com).

**Säkerhet**

Vi arbetar för att upprätthålla säkerheten för dina personuppgifter. Vi använder tekniska och organisatoriska åtgärder för att tillhandahålla en säkerhetsnivå som är lämplig för behandlingen av din personliga information. För mer information om hur Honeywell skyddar din personliga information, vänligen kontakta oss på [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com).

**Dina rättigheter**

Beroende på tillämplig lag kan du ha vissa rättigheter med avseende på din personliga information.

* Du kan ha rätt att **få tillgång till, korrigera, uppdatera** eller **begära radering** av din personliga information.
* Du kan **motsätta dig** behandlingen av din personliga information, be oss att **begränsa** behandlingen av din personliga information eller begära **flyttbarhet** av din personliga information.
* Du kan ha rätt **att inte få ett beslut fattat om dig som enbart baseras på automatiserad behandling, inklusive profilering** om beslutet i fråga leder till rättsliga effekter för dig eller påverkar dig på något väsentligt sätt.
* På samma sätt, om vi har samlat in och behandlat din personliga information med ditt samtycke, **kan du när som helst dra tillbaka ditt samtycke**. Tillbakadragande av ditt samtycke påverkar inte lagenligheten av all behandling som vi genomfört före ditt tillbakadragande och det kommer inte heller att påverka behandlingen av din personliga information som utförs beroende av andra lagliga behandlingsgrunder än samtycke.
* Du kan ha rätt att **välja bort försäljning av din personliga information**. Honeywell säljer inte din personliga information till tredje part för vinst. Vi delar eller lämnar dock ut din personliga information till tredje part i enlighet med denna sekretesspolicy och vårt [Meddelande om användning av cookies](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/cookie-notice#swedish). Till exempel samarbetar vi med tredje part för att distribuera våra produkter, tillhandahålla teknisk hjälp, använda verktyg för analys av webbplatser och funktioner samt bedriva marknadsföring och försäljning av våra produkter och tjänster. Sådana aktiviteter kan innebära att din personliga information lämnas ut till tredje part och kan betraktas som en ”försäljning” av uppgifter enligt vissa (men inte alla) dataskyddslagar.
* Du har rätt att **lämna klagomål** till en dataskyddsmyndighet som ansvarar för att övervaka efterlevnaden av dataskyddslagen i din jurisdiktion gällande vår insamling och användning av din personliga information om du anser att vår behandling av din personliga information inte överensstämmer med dataskyddslagen. Till exempel har enskilda personer inom EES rätt att lämna in ett klagomål till den behöriga dataskyddsmyndigheten, vars lista kan nås på: [https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members\_en](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en). Vi skulle dock uppskatta att få möjligheten att ta itu med dina frågor, så kontakta oss gärna angående eventuella klagomål. Vi diskriminerar inte individer för att de utövar sina dataskyddsrättigheter.

Vi kommer att underlätta ditt utövande av de rättigheter som gäller för dig i enlighet med tillämplig lag. Men även om din personliga information inte ges skydd enligt eller på annat sätt omfattas av en dataskyddslag kan vi försöka tillgodose de krav eller förfrågningar du har om vår databehandling. Om du har frågor om dina rättigheter eller vill utöva dina rättigheter kan du kontakta oss på [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com) eller skicka in dina frågor rörande sekretess via vårt interaktiva webbformulär på följande länk:

Våra webbplatser är inte riktade till och bör inte användas av barn under sexton (16) år och vi samlar inte medvetet in, använder eller säljer information från sådana individer. Om du är minderårig enligt lagarna i ditt land, vänligen lämna inte någon personlig information via våra webbplatser.

**Länkar till andra webbplatser**

Våra webbplatser kan innehålla länkar till webbplatser, produkter och tjänster tillhörande tredje part. Vi har ingen skyldighet eller ansvar för dessa webbplatser, produkter och tjänster, deras policyer, deras insamling eller annan behandling av din personliga information. Dessa tredje parters praxis styrs av deras egen sekretesspolicy. Vi uppmuntrar dig att ta reda på vad dessa tredje parter har för sekretesspolicyer.

**Bilgilerinizin anonimleştirilmesi**

Yürürlükteki yasalara uygun olarak kişisel bilgilerinizi sizi tanımlama amacıyla kullanılamaması için anonim hale getirebiliriz. Anonimleştirilmiş bilgiler kişisel bilgi olarak kabul edilmez ve bu nedenle bu Gizlilik Bildirimine tabi değildir. Anonimleştirilmiş bilgileri herhangi bir amaç için toplayabilir, kullanabilir, bir araya getirebilir ve paylaşabiliriz.

**Bilgilerinizi saklama süremiz**

Kişisel bilgilerinizi depoladığımız süre işlemenin amacına göre değişiklik gösterir. Örneğin, size ürünler veya hizmetler sunmak veya talep ettiğiniz işlemleri gerçekleştirmek için gereken kişisel bilgileri, Honeywell müşterisi olduğunuz süre boyunca depolarız veya Sitelerimiz üzerinden bir iş başvurusu göndermeniz halinde başvurunuzla bağlantılı olarak size sunulan gizlilik bildiriminde veya diğer bildirimlerde belirtildiği şekilde ya da yasaların gerektirdiği başka şekillerde başvurunuzun detaylarını tutarız. Diğer tüm durumlarda kişisel bilgilerinizi bu Gizlilik Bildiriminde belirtilen amaçları karşılamak için gereken süre boyunca depolarız, sonrasında bu bilgiler anonim hale getirilir (yürürlükteki yasaların izin verdiği durumlarda), silinir veya imha edilir.

**Bilgilerin açıklanması**

işisel bilgilerinizi yürürlükteki yasalara uygun olarak ve aşağıda belirtilen biçimlerin dahil olduğu şekillerde seçilmiş üçüncü taraflarla paylaşabiliriz:

* **Grup şirketlerimiz.** Kişisel bilgilerinizi bu Gizlilik Bildiriminde belirtilen amaçlar için makul ölçüde gerekli olduğu şekilde bağlı kuruluşlarımızla veya grup şirketlerimizle paylaşabiliriz.
* **Hizmet sağlayıcılar.** Kişisel bilgilerinizi bizim adımıza web sitelerini barındırma, anket yapma, işlem gerçekleştirme, Sitelerimizi analiz etme ve işimizin, Sitelerimizin, ürünlerimizin ve hizmetlerimizin kalitesini iyileştirmek için analizler gerçekleştirme gibi hizmetler sunmaları için sözleşme yaptığımız şirketlerle paylaşabiliriz. Bu hizmet sağlayıcıların kişisel bilgilerin gizliliğini korumalarını talep ederiz.
* **Dağıtımcılar ve diğer güvenilir iş ortakları.** Kişisel bilgilerinizi ürünlerimizi dağıtan üçünü taraflarla veya diğer güvenilir iş ortaklarıyla söz konusu üçüncü tarafların size pazarlama iletileri göndermesine olanak sağlamayı içeren amaçlarla paylaşabiliriz. Kişisel bilgilerin pazarlama amacıyla bu şekilde paylaşılması yürürlükteki yasalara ve yönetmeliklere uygun olarak gerçekleştirilir.
* **İşlemlerle bağlantılı olarak ifşa.** Belirli işlemlerle bağlantılı olarak kişisel bilgilerinizin bir kısmını veya tamamını işlemin yerine getirilmesinde rol oynayan mali kuruluşlara, kamu tüzel kişiliklerine ve taşımacılık şirketlerine veya posta hizmetlerine ifşa edebiliriz.
* **Satın almalar veya elden çıkarmalarla bağlantılı ifşa.** Honeywell'in stratejik veya diğer ticari nedenlerle bazı ülkelerde işletmeleri satmaya, satın almaya, elden çıkarmaya, birleştirmeye veya başka bir şekilde yeniden düzenlemeye karar verdiği durumlar ortaya çıkabilir. Hakkınızda tuttuğumuz bilgileri bir birleşmenin pazarlıklarının sürmesi veya tamamlanması, Honeywell'in varlıklarının bir kısmının veya tamamının alınması, elden çıkarılması veya satılması için gereken makul düzeyde ifşa edebiliriz.
* **Başka nedenlerle ifşa.** Yasaların zorunlu kılması ya da izin vermesi veya yasal gereklere ya da hakkımızdaki yasal bir sürece uymak, haklarımızı ya da mal ve mülkümüzü korumak ve savunmak veya acil durumlarda herhangi bir kimsenin kişisel emniyetini korumak için bunun gerekli olduğuna art niyetsiz olarak kani olunması durumunda kişisel bilgileri ifşa edebiliriz.

**Uluslararası aktarımlar**

Honeywell küresel bir kuruluştur ve kişisel bilgileriniz yürürlükteki yasalara uygun olarak ABD, Meksika ve Hindistan gibi dünyanın çeşitli yerlerinde aktarılabilir, tutulabilir, saklanabilir veya kullanılabilir. Bu, kişisel bilgilerinizi topladığımızda, ülkenizin yasalarından farklı veri koruma yasalarına sahip olabilecek ülkelerde işlenebileceği anlamına gelir. Ancak Honeywell, gizliliğinizi korumak ve Avrupa Komisyonu'nun Standart Sözleşme Maddelerinin uygulanmasını da içeren ikamet ettiğiniz ülkeyle karşılaştırılabilir düzeyde kişisel bilgilerin korunmasını sağlamak için her zaman makul adımlar atacaktır. Kişisel bilgilerinizi korumaya yönelik uygun önlemler hakkında daha fazla bilgi için lütfen [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com) adresinden bizimle iletişime geçin.

**Güvenlik**

Kişisel bilgilerinizin güvenliğini koruma kararlılığıyla çalışırız. Kişisel bilgilerinizin işlenmesi riskine uygun bir güvenlik düzeyi sağlamak için teknik ve organizasyonel önlemler alıyoruz. Honeywell'in kişisel bilgilerinizi nasıl koruduğu hakkında daha fazla bilgi için [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com) adresinden bizimle iletişime geçin.

**Haklarınız**

Yürürlükteki yasalara bağlı olarak, kişisel bilgilerinizle ilgili belirli haklara sahip olabilirsiniz.

* Kişisel bilgilerinize dair **erişim, düzeltme, güncelleme** veya **silme talebinde bulunma** hakkınız olabilir.
* Kişisel bilgilerinizin işlenmesine **itiraz edebilir**, kişisel bilgilerinizin işlenmesini **kısıtlamamızı** isteyebilir veya kişisel bilgilerinizin **taşınabilirliğini** talep edebilirsiniz.
* Bu kararın sizin hakkınızda yasal sonuçlar doğurması veya sizi önemli ölçüde etkilemesi durumunda, **profil çıkarma da dahil olmak üzere, yalnızca otomatik işlemeye dayalı bir karar vermeme** hakkına sahip olabilirsiniz.
* Benzer şekilde, kişisel bilgilerinizi sizin rızanızla toplamış ve işlemişsek, bu durumda **onayınızı istediğiniz zaman geri çekebilirsiniz**. Onayınızı geri çekmeniz, geri çekmenizden önce gerçekleştirdiğimiz herhangi bir işlemin yasallığını etkilemeyecek ve onay dışındaki yasal işleme gerekçelerine dayanarak yürütülen kişisel bilgilerinizin işlenmesini etkilemeyecektir.
* Kişisel bilgilerinizin satışını **devre dışı bırakma hakkına sahip olabilirsiniz**. Honeywell, kişisel bilgilerinizi kar amacıyla üçüncü taraflara satmaz. Ancak, bu Gizlilik Bildirimi ve [Çerez Bildirimimiz](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/cookie-notice#turkish) uyarınca kişisel bilgilerinizi üçüncü taraflarla paylaşır veya başka bir şekilde ifşa ederiz. Örneğin, ürünlerimizi dağıtmak, size teknik yardım sağlamak, web sitesi analitik araçlarını ve özelliklerini çalıştırmak ve ürün ve hizmetlerimizin pazarlanması ve satışını yapmak için üçüncü taraflarla etkileşime gireriz. Bu tür faaliyetler, kişisel bilgilerinizin üçüncü taraflara ifşa edilmesini içerebilir ve belirli (ancak hepsi olmamak üzere) veri koruma yasaları uyarınca verilerin "satışı" olarak değerlendirilebilir.
* Kişisel bilgilerinizin işlenmesinin veri koruma yasasına uygun olmadığını düşünüyorsanız, kişisel bilgilerinizi toplamamız ve kullanmamız hakkında yargı bölgenizdeki veri koruma yasasına uyumu denetlemekten sorumlu bir veri koruma yetkilisine **şikayette bulunma** hakkınız vardır. Örneğin, AEA'daki bireyler, yetkili Veri Koruma Kurumu'na şikayette bulunma hakkına sahiptir. Bunların listesine şuradan erişebilirsiniz: [https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members\_en](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en). Bununla birlikte, sorunlarınızın üzerine eğilmek istediğimizden, herhangi bir şikayetinizle ilgili olarak lütfen bizimle iletişime geçmekten çekinmeyin. Veri gizliliği haklarını kullandıkları için bireylere karşı ayrımcılık yapmayacağız.

Yürürlükteki yasalara uygun olarak, sizin için geçerli olan hakları kullanmanızı kolaylaştırırız. Bununla birlikte, kişisel bilgileriniz bir veri koruma yasası kapsamında koruma sağlamasa veya başka bir şekilde korunmasa bile, veri işleme faaliyetlerimizle ilgili olabilecek herhangi bir talep veya sorguyu yerine getirmeye çalışabiliriz. Haklarınızla ilgili sorularınız varsa veya haklarınızı kullanmak istiyorsanız, [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com) adresinden bizimle iletişime geçebilirsiniz veya aşağıdaki bağlantıdaki interaktif web formumuz aracılığıyla gizliliğe dair sorularınızı gönderebilirsiniz:

**Diğer web sitelerine bağlantılar**

Sitelerimiz üçüncü taraf web sitelerine, ürünlere ve hizmetlere bağlantılar içerebilir.
