* **Performance cookies** collect information about your use of our Sites (for e.g. it allows us to count visits and traffic sources) and help us learn how our Sites are performing so that we can make relevant improvements that could better your browsing experience (for e.g. it allow us to know which pages are the most and least popular). All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous.
* **Advertising/ targeting cookies** collect data about your online activity and identify your interests so that we can create a profile for you and to provide advertising that is more relevant to you. They also perform functions like preventing the same adverts from continuously reappearing, ensuring that adverts are properly displayed, and selecting adverts that are based on your interests.

**Why do we use Cookies and other similar technologies?**

We use Cookies and other similar tracking technologies for the following purposes:

* Store your preferences and settings;
* Permit you to sign-in and authenticate you so that you can access our Sites and to move from page to page within our Sites;
* Secure our Sites including fraud detection and prevention;
* Tailor information presented to you based on your browsing preferences, such as language and geographical region;

* [Targeted Advertising](#targetedadvertising); and
* [Cross-device and cross-site tracking](#crossdevice).

**Who uses the information stored in Cookies and similar tracking technologies?**

The information stored in our Sites’ Cookies is used exclusively by us (or by third parties acting on our behalf), with the exception of third-party Cookies which are used and managed by external parties to provide services requested by us to improve our services and your experience when navigating our Sites. For more information on the first-party and third-party cookies that Honeywell uses please visit our [Privacy Preference Center](#).

You can also control Flash LSOs by going to the Global Storage Settings Panel and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash LSOs).

**Targeted Advertising**

We track and analyse both individualized usage and aggregated statistical information related to your use of our Sites. We also partner with third parties (such as advertisers and ad partners) to display advertising on our Sites and to manage and serve advertising on other third-party sites. These third parties use cookies and similar tracking technologies to collect and use certain information about your online activities, either on our Sites or other third-party sites to measure and track the effectiveness of advertisements and our online marketing activities (for example, by collecting data on how many times you click on one of our advertisements). This information may be used alone or in combination with information about you we obtain from other sources (like our data partners), your contact details and Honeywell transaction history to infer your interests and deliver you targeted advertisements and marketing that are more tailored to you based on your browsing activities and inferred interests ("Interest-Based Advertising"). Such Interest-Based Advertising will only be delivered where permitted by applicable law and in accordance with your advertising/marketing preferences. Please note that other third parties’ cookies and technologies are governed by each company’s specific privacy policy and not this Cookie Notice.

**Cross-device and cross-site tracking**

We, our service providers and other third parties (such as Google and other ad partners) may use information we collect about you (whether directly from our Sites or from a third party) for the purposes of recognizing you online by identifying the Devices that you use. We use this information to serve you [targeted advertising](#targetedadvertising) across multiple different Devices (“cross-device matching”) and sites (“cross-site tracking”). Cross-device matching and cross-site tracking allows us to better understand our customer’s activity, improve our ability to target and measure ad campaigns (including limiting the number of times a user sees an advert). It also helps us match Devices so we can facilitate your opt-out choices across all the Devices we know are connected to an opted-out cookie.

**Disabling Cookies and opting out of Interest-Based Advertising**

You can make choices about receiving cookies by using our [Privacy Preference Center](#) or alternatively, your browser settings should allow you to delete and/or disable website cookies. For more information about how to delete your cookies in your web browser, refer to your browser’s instructions: [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en),  [Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies), [Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4468242/microsoft-edge-browsing-data-and-privacy), [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/clear-cookies-and-site-data-firefox), [Opera](https://help.opera.com/en/latest/web-preferences/#cookies), Safari ([Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac), [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265), [iPad](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265), or [iPod touch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265)).

If you choose to disable cookies, you may find Sites may not work in the same way. Some cookies are necessary to record and respect the choices you have made in regard to not being contacted or to not have other types of cookies added to your Device. If you delete cookies from your computer, the cookie used to recognize your preferences including Interest-Based Advertising will also be deleted requiring you to make your choices again.

Users may also opt out of third-party ad networks through the use of various trade association websites such as:

* Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) - [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/)
* Digital Advertising alliance (DAA) – (i) Global: [https://optout.aboutads.info/](https://optout.aboutads.info/); (ii) Europe: [http://youronlinechoices.eu/](http://youronlinechoices.eu/)

Opting out of Interest-Based Advertising will opt you out from these companies’ delivery of interest-based content or ads to you but does not mean you no longer will receive any advertising through our website or other websites. You may still see Honeywell ads but those ads will not be customized to you by Honeywell or our partners. If at any time you do not want your personal information to be used to allow third-parties to display advertisements or to personalize advertisements displayed to you, you may also adjust your settings by using the tools provided by third-parties such as. Google, Facebook and LinkedIn.

**Do Not Track (DNT)**

Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to Sites with which you communicate. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them.  We may not act in response to these signals. You may also disable certain tracking (e.g. by disabling cookies) and you may also opt out of targeted advertising by following the instructions that in the “[Disabling Cookies and opting out of Interest-Based Advertising](#disablingcookies)” section.

يصف إشعار ملفات تعريف الارتباط هذا كيف أن شركة Honeywell International Inc. والشركات التابعة لها (يُشار إليها إجمالًا باسم **Honeywellالخاص/ة بنا**، أو**نحن**) تستخدم ملفات تعريف الارتباط والتقنيات المشابهة المثبتة على أجهزة مثل الكمبيوتر، أو الهاتف المحمول، أو الجهاز اللوحي (**الأجهزة**) الخاصة بزائري -أو مستخدمي- موقعنا الإلكتروني، و/أو منتجاتنا، و/أو تطبيقاتنا (**المواقع**).

يمكن لملفات تعريف الارتباط والتقنيات المشابهة معالجة المعلومات الشخصية. يُرجى زيارة:

* · [بيان الخصوصية](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/privacy-statement#arabic) الخاص بنا إذا كنت ترغب في الحصول على مزيدٍ من المعلومات حول كيفية معالجتنا لمعلوماتك الشخصية، وكيفية ممارسة حقوق أصحاب البيانات لديك
* ·[مركز تفضيلات الخصوصية](#) الخاص بنا لمزيدٍ من المعلومات حول ملفات تعريف الارتباط المحددة التي نستخدمها على مواقعنا، ولإدارة تفضيلات ملفات تعريف الارتباط الخاصة بك.

**ما المقصود بملفات تعريف الارتباط؟**

ملفات تعريف الارتباط هي ملفات نصية صغيرة تضعها مواقعنا على أجهزتك. وعند زيارة مواقعنا مجددًا، تتصل تقنياتنا تلقائيًا بملف تعريف الارتباط للتعرف عليك أو على جهازك، وتستدعي المعلومات الخاصة بك، مثل معلومات تسجيل الدخول أو تفضيلات اللغة. كما نستخدم ملفات تعريف الارتباط التابعة لجهات خارجية. وهي ملفات تعريف ارتباط من مجالٍ مختلفٍ عن مجال موقع الويب الذي تزوره، والذي يسمح لنا، وللجهات الخارجية التي تمتلك ملفات تعريف الارتباط -وأحيانًا للمشاركين الآخرين في شبكات ملفات تعريف الارتباط- بالتعرف عليك أو على جهازك أثناء زيارتك لمواقع الويب المختلفة. ونحن نستخدم كلمة ملفات تعريف الارتباط لتضمين جزء من نص، أو وحدات بكسل، أو ملفات gif واضحة، أو ملفات سجلات، أو برامج ملحقة لتتبُّع الويب أو أي تقنية تتبُّع أخرى مماثلة يتم وضعها على أجهزتك.

**:وهناك أربعة أنواع من ملفات تعريف الارتباط التي يمكن أن نستخدمها**

**· ملفات تعريف الارتباط شديدة الأهمية** وتُعدّ ضروريةً لمواقعنا حتى تتمكن من العمل، ومن تزويدك بما طلبته من خدماتٍ ومعلومات. ويتم استثناء ملفات تعريف الارتباط شديدة الأهمية من شروط الموافقة.

* **ملفات تعريف الارتباط الوظيفية** تعمل على تمكين الوظائف المحسّنة والتخصيص. فهي -على سبيل المثال- تسمح لمواقعنا بتذكّر المعلومات التي تقدّمُها، مثل تفضيلات اللغة لديك، وتخزين المعلومات الفنية المفيدة لتفاعلاتك مع مواقعنا. وقد يتم تعيينها من قِبلنا أو من قِبل مزودي الجهات الخارجية الذين أضفنا خدماتهم إلى مواقعنا. وفي حال لم تسمح بملفات تعريف الارتباط هذه، فقد لا تعمل بعض هذه الخدمات أو كلّها بشكلٍ صحيحٍ.
* **ملفات تعريف الارتباط الخاصة بالأداء** تعمل على جمع معلوماتٍ حول استخدامك لمواقعنا (فهي تسمح لنا -على سبيل المثال- بإحصاء عدد الزيارات ومصادر حركة المرور)، كما تساعدنا في معرفة مستويات أداء مواقعنا حتى نتمكن من إجراء تحسيناتٍ ذات صلةٍ يمكنها أن تحسّن من تجربة التصفح لديك (فهي تُتيح لنا -على سبيل المثال- أن نتعرف على الصفحات الأكثر شيوعًا والصفحات الأقل شيوعًا). ويتم تجميع كل المعلومات التي تجمعها ملفات تعريف الارتباط هذه، لذلك تكون مجهولة المصدر.
* **ملفات تعريف الارتباط المخصصة للإعلان/الاستهداف** تجمع بياناتٍ حول نشاطك عبر الإنترنت وتحديد اهتماماتك؛ حتى نتمكن من إنشاء ملف تعريفٍ لك وتقديم إعلانات أكثر صلة بك. كما أنها تقوم بأداء وظائف أخرى مثل منع الظهور المستمر للإعلانات المكررة، والتأكّد من عرض الإعلانات بشكلٍ صحيح، واختيار الإعلانات المعتمدة على اهتماماتك.

لمزيدٍ من المعلومات حول ملفات تعريف الارتباط التي تستخدمها شركة Honeywell، يُرجى زيارة [مركز تفضيلات الخصوصية](#)**.**

**لمَ نستخدم ملفات تعريف الارتباط والتقنيات المماثلة الأخرى؟**

نستخدم ملفات تعريف الارتباط وتقنيات التتبُّع المماثلة الأخرى للأغراض التالية:

* تخزين التفضيلات والإعدادات الخاصة بك؛
* السماح لك بتسجيل الدخول والمصادقة عليك حتى تتمكن من الوصول إلى مواقعنا والتنقل داخلها من صفحة إلى أخرى؛
* تأمين مواقعنا بما يتضمّن الكشف عن حالات الاحتيال والوقاية منها؛
* تخصيص المعلومات المقدمة لك بناءً على تفضيلات التصفح الخاصة بك، مثل اللغة والمنطقة الجغرافية؛
* مراقبة أنماط حركة المستخدمين داخل مواقعنا وجمع الإحصائيات المتعلقة باستخدامك لموقع الويب؛ لمساعدتنا على فهم مستويات أداء مواقعنا وكيفية تحسينها لأغراضٍ مثل تعزيز تجربة التصفح الخاصة بك، وتقديم خدماتٍ أكثر صلة بك؛
* تزويدنا بالمعلومات التجارية والتسويقية؛
* تتبُّع المستخدمين الذين يزورون مواقعنا، وصفحات وسائل التواصل الاجتماعي الخاصة بنا، والإعلانات المعروضة عبر الإنترنت والاتصالات التسويقية، أو يتفاعلون معها، أو يستخدمونها (مثل الإعلانات التي يتم النقر عليها، أو مثل فتح المستخدم لرسالة بريد إلكتروني أرسلناها إليه، أو قيامه بإعادة توجيهها)؛ إلى جانب
* [الإعلانات المستهدفة](#targetedadvertisingarabic)؛ و
* [التتبُّع عبر الأجهزة وعبر المواقع](#crossdevicearabic).

**من يستخدم المعلومات المخزنة في ملفات تعريف الارتباط وتقنيات التتبّع المماثلة؟**

تُستخدم المعلومات المخزّنة في ملفات تعريف الارتباط الخاصة بمواقعنا بشكلٍ حصريٍّ من جِهتنا (أو من قِبل جهاتٍ خارجيةٍ تعمل بالنيابة عنا) -وهذا لا يتضمّن ملفات تعريف الارتباط الخاصة بالجهات الخارجية، والتي يتم استخدامها وإدارتها من قِبَل أطراف خارجية- وذلك لتوفير الخدمات المطلوبة من جانبنا؛ لتحسين خدماتنا وتحسين تجربتك عند التنقل في مواقعنا. لمزيدٍ من المعلومات حول ملفات تعريف الموقع الحالي وملفات تعريف الموقع غير المستخدم حاليًا، والتي تستخدمها شركة Honeywell، يُرجى زيارة [مركز تفضيلات الخصوصية](#) الخاص بنا**.**

**ماذا عن ملفات تعريف الارتباط (أو العناصر المحلية المشتركة) الخاصة بـ Flash؟**  
  
يمكن أن نستخدم ملفات تعريف الارتباط الخاصة بـ Flash أو العناصر المحلية المشتركة الخاصة بـ Flash (Flash LSOs) لتخزين تفضيلات موقع الويب لديك، وتخصيص زيارتك، والوقاية من محاولات الاحتيال، كما يمكن أن نستخدمها لعمليات الموقع الأخرى. وإذا كنت لا تريد تخزين العناصر المحلية المشتركة الخاصة بـ Flash Flash LSOs على جهاز الكمبيوتر الخاص بك، يمكنك ضبط إعدادات مُشغّل Flash لحظر تخزين عناصر Flash LSOs باستخدام الأدوات الموجودة في لوحة إعدادات تخزين موقع الويب. كما يمكنك التحكم في عناصر Flash LSOs بالانتقال إلى لوحة إعدادات التخزين العمومية واتباع التعليمات (والتي قد تتضمن تعليماتٍ تشرح -على سبيل المثال- كيفية حذف عناصر Flash LSOs الموجودة).

**الإعلانات المستهدفة**

نتتبّع كلًّا من الاستخدامات الفردية والمعلومات الإحصائية المجمّعة المتعلقة باستخدامك لمواقعنا ونحللها. كما نتشارك مع الجهات الخارجية (مثل المُعلِنين وشركاء الإعلانات) لعرض الإعلانات على مواقعنا وإدارتها على مواقع الجهات الخارجية الأخرى وعرضها عليها. تستخدم هذه الجهات الخارجية ملفات تعريف الارتباط وتقنيات التتبع المماثلة لجمع معلوماتٍ معينة حول أنشطتك عبر الإنترنت، واستخدامها إما على مواقعنا وإما على مواقع جهاتٍ خارجيةٍ أخرى؛ لقياس فعالية الإعلانات وأنشطتنا التسويقية عبر الإنترنت وتتبُّعها (على سبيل المثال: من خلال جمع البيانات المتعلّقة بعدد مرات النقر فوق أحد إعلاناتنا). كما يمكن استخدام هذه المعلومات منفردةً أو مع المعلومات المتعلقة بك -التي نحصل عليها من مصادر أخرى (مثل شركاء البيانات لدينا)- إلى جانب تفاصيل الاتصال الخاصة بك وسجل معاملات Honeywell لاستنتاج اهتماماتك وتقديم إعلاناتٍ مستهدفة، وحملات تسويقية مستهدفة تتناسب معك أكثر، وذلك بناءً على أنشطة التصفح والاهتمامات المستنتجة (الإعلانات القائمة على الاهتمامات). ولن يتم تقديم مثل هذه الإعلانات القائمة على الاهتمامات إلا في الحالات المسموح بها بموجب القانون المعمول به ووفقًا لتفضيلاتك الإعلانية/التسويقية. يُرجى ملاحظة أن ملفات تعريف الارتباط والتقنيات الخاصة بالجهات الخارجية الأخرى تحكمها سياسة الخصوصية الخاصة بكل شركة وأن هذا الإشعار ليس خاصًّا بملفات تعريف الارتباط.

**التتبُّع عبر الأجهزة وعبر المواقع**

يمكننا، كما يمكن لمقدمي خدماتنا والجهات الخارجية الأخرى -مثل Google وشركاء الإعلانات الآخرين- استخدام المعلومات التي نجمعها عنك -سواء أكان ذلك مباشرةً من مواقعنا أم من جهةٍ خارجية- لأغراض التعرّف عليك عبر الإنترنت من خلال تحديد الأجهزة التي تستعملها. ونحن نستخدم هذه المعلومات لتقديم إعلانات تستهدفك عبر العديد من الأجهزة المختلفة ("المطابقة عبر الأجهزة") والمواقع المختلفة ("التتبُّع عبر المواقع"). تُمكّننا المطابقة عبر الأجهزة والتتبع عبر المواقعمن فهم نشاط عملائنا بشكلٍ أفضل، وتحسين قدرتنا على استهدافهم بالحملات الإعلانية وقياسها (وهذا يتضمن تقييد عدد المرات التي يرى فيها المستخدم أحد الإعلانات). كما تساعدنا في مطابقة الأجهزة لنتمكن من تسهيل اختيارات إلغاء الاشتراك عبر جميع الأجهزة التي نعرف أنها متصلة بملف تعريف ارتباط إلغاء الاشتراك.

**تعطيل ملفات تعريف الارتباط وإلغاء الاشتراك في الإعلانات القائمة على الاهتمامات**

يمكنك تحديد اختياراتك بشأن استلام ملفات تعريف الارتباط باستخدام [مركز تفضيلات الخصوصية](#) الخاص بنا، أو -بدلًا من ذلك- يجب أن تسمح لك إعدادات المتصفح الخاص بك بحذف و/أو تعطيل ملفات تعريف الارتباط الخاصة بموقع الويب. لمزيد من المعلومات حول كيفية حذف ملفات تعريف الارتباط في متصفح الويب الخاص بك، راجع إرشادات المتصفح الخاص بك: [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en)، أو [Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies)، أو [Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4468242/microsoft-edge-browsing-data-and-privacy)، أو [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/clear-cookies-and-site-data-firefox)، أو [Opera، أو](https://help.opera.com/en/latest/web-preferences/#cookies) Safari ([Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac)، أو [iPhone، أو iPad، أو iPod touch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265)).

إذا اخترت تعطيل ملفات تعريف الارتباط، فقد تجد أن المواقع لم تعد تعمل بالطريقة نفسها. بعض ملفات تعريف الارتباط ضرورية لتسجيل الخيارات التي حددتها ومراعاتها فيما يتعلق بعدم الاتصال أو عدم إضافة أنواع أخرى من ملفات تعريف الارتباط إلى جهازك. وإذا قمت بحذف ملفات تعريف الارتباط من جهاز الكمبيوتر الخاص بك، فسيتم كذلك حذف ملف تعريف الارتباط المستخدم للتعرّف على تفضيلاتك، بما في ذلك الإعلانات القائمة على الاهتمامات، وهذا يستدعي منك تحديد اختياراتك مرةً أخرى.

كما يمكن للمستخدمين إلغاء الاشتراك في شبكات الإعلانات التابعة لجهاتٍ خارجيةٍ من خلال استخدام مواقع الويب الخاصة بالاتحادات التجارية المختلفة مثل:

* مبادرة إعلان شبكة الاتصال (NAI) - [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/)
* تحالف الإعلان الرقمي (DAA) - (1) عالمي: [https://optout.aboutads.info](https://optout.aboutads.info/) ؛ (2) أوروبا: [http://youronlinechoices.eu](http://youronlinechoices.eu/)

سيؤدي إلغاء الاشتراك في الإعلانات القائمة على الاهتمامات إلى إلغاء اشتراكك فيما تقدّمه هذه الشركات من محتوى أو إعلاناتٍ قائمة على الاهتمامات، ولكن لا يعني هذا أنك لن تتلقى أي إعلانات من خلال موقعنا الإلكتروني أو من خلال مواقع الويب الأخرى. قد تظل إعلانات Honeywell تظهر لك ولكن لن يتم تخصيص هذه الإعلانات لك من جانبنا في Honeywell ولا من جانب شركائنا. إذا كنت ترغب بأي وقت في عدم السماح للجهات الخارجية باستخدام معلوماتك الشخصية مُطلقًا بما يُمكِّنها من تشغيل الإعلانات المعروضة لك أو تخصيصها، يمكنك كذلك ضبط إعداداتك باستخدام الأدوات التي توفرها جهات خارجية مثل: Google، و Facebook، و LinkedIn.

**عدم التتبُّع (DNT)**

قد ترسل بعض متصفحات الويب إشارات عدم التتبُّع إلى المواقع التي تستخدمها. ونظرًا إلى الاختلافات في كيفية دمج متصفحات الويب لهذه الميزة وتفعيلها، فليس من الواضح دومًا ما إذا كان المستخدمون يخططون لإرسال هذه الإشارات، أو ما إذا كانوا على علمٍ بها أو لا. يمكننا ألا نستجيب لهذه الإشارات. كما يمكنك تعطيل تتبُّع معين (من خلال تعطيل ملفات تعريف الارتباط مثلًا)، ويمكنك كذلك إلغاء الاشتراك في [الإعلانات المستهدفة](#targetedadvertisingarabic) باتباع التعليمات الواردة في قسم [تعطيل ملفات تعريف الارتباط وإلغاء الاشتراك في الإعلانات القائمة على الاهتمامات](#disablingcookiesarabic)

Cookies og lignende teknologier kan behandle personlige oplysninger. Besøg venligst:

* vores [databeskyttelseserklæring](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/privacy-statement#danish), hvis du vil have flere oplysninger om, hvordan vi behandler dine personoplysninger, og hvordan du gør brug af dine rettigheder som registreret
* vores [indstillingscenter for databeskyttelse](#) for flere oplysninger om de specifikke cookies, vi bruger på vores sider, og for at administrere dine cookieindstillinger.

**Hvad er cookies?**

Cookies er små tekstfiler, som vores sider gemmer på dine enheder. Når du besøger vores sider flere gange, opretter vores teknologier automatisk forbindelse til cookien for at identificere dig eller din enhed og huske oplysninger om dig, såsom dine sprogpræferencer eller loginoplysninger. Vi bruger også tredjepartscookies, som er cookies fra et andet domæne end domænet på den hjemmeside, du besøger, som giver os, den tredjepart, der ejer de pågældende cookies og i nogle tilfælde andre deltagere i cookienetværket, mulighed for at identificere dig eller din enhed, når du besøger forskellige hjemmesider. Vi bruger ordet »cookies«, når vi taler om et stykke tekst, pixels, gennemsigtige gifs, logfiler, web beacons eller anden lignende sporingsteknologi, der gemmes på dine enheder.

**Der er fire cookietyper, som vi kan bruge:**

* **Strengt nødvendige cookies** er nødvendige for at vores sider kan fungere og levere de tjenester og oplysninger, du har anmodet om, til dig. Strengt nødvendige cookies er undtaget fra kravet om samtykke.
* **Funktionelle cookies** muliggør forbedret funktionalitet og tilpasning. Disse giver for eksempel vores sider mulighed for at huske oplysninger, som du angiver, f.eks. dine sprogindstillinger, og gemme tekniske oplysninger, der er nyttige for dine interaktioner med vores sider. De kan indstilles af os eller af tredjepartsudbydere, hvis tjenester vi har tilføjet til vores sider.  Hvis du ikke tillader disse cookies, vil nogle eller alle disse tjenester muligvis ikke fungere korrekt.
* **Præstationscookies** indsamler oplysninger om din brug af vores sider (f.eks. giver de os mulighed for at tælle antal besøg og trafikkilder) og hjælper os med at finde ud af, hvordan vores sider klarer sig, så vi kan foretage relevante forbedringer, der kan forbedre din browseroplevelse (f.eks. giver de os mulighed for at se, hvilke sider der er de mest og mindst populære). Alle oplysninger, som disse cookies indsamler, er aggregerede og derfor anonyme.
* **Annoncerings-/målretningscookies** indsamler data om din onlineaktivitet og identificerer dine interesser, så vi kan oprette en profil om dig og levere annoncer, der er mere relevante for dig. De udfører også funktioner, som eksempelvis at forhindre de samme annoncer i løbende at blive vist igen, sikre, at annoncer vises korrekt, og vælge annoncer, der er baseret på dine interesser.

Du kan få flere oplysninger om de cookies, Honeywell bruger, ved at besøge vores [indstillingscenter for databeskyttelse](#).

**Hvorfor bruger vi cookies og andre lignende teknologier?**

Vi bruger cookies og andre lignende sporingsteknologier til følgende formål:

* At gemme dine præferencer og indstillinger;
* At give dig mulighed for at logge ind og godkende dig, så du kan tilgå vores sider, og gå fra webside til webside inden for vores sider;
* At sikre vores sider, herunder detektering og forebyggelse af svindel;
* At skræddersy oplysninger, der præsenteres for dig baseret på dine browserindstillinger, såsom sprog og geografisk område;
* At overvåge trafikmønstrene for brugere på vores sider og indsamle statistik vedrørende din hjemmesidebrug for at hjælpe os med at forstå, hvordan vores sider klarer sig, og hvordan vi kan forbedre vores sider med henblik på f.eks. at forbedre din browseroplevelse og tilbyde tjenester, der er mere relevante for dig;
* At give os forretnings- og markedsføringsoplysninger;
* At spore brugere, der besøger, interagerer med eller bruger nogen af vores sider, sider på sociale medier, onlineannoncer og markedsføringskommunikation (f.eks. hvilke annoncer, der klikkes på, eller om en bruger har åbnet eller videresendt en e-mail, vi har sendt personen); og
* [Målrettet annoncering;](#targetedadvertising-danish) og
* [Sporing på tværs af enheder og sider](#crossdevice-danish).

**Hvem bruger de oplysninger, der er gemt i cookies og lignende sporingsteknologier?**

De oplysninger, der er gemt i vores siders cookies, bruges udelukkende af os (eller af tredjeparter, der handler på vores vegne), med undtagelse af tredjepartscookies, som bruges og administreres af eksterne parter for at levere de tjenester, der anmodes om af os, som bruges til at forbedre vores tjenester og din oplevelse, når du bruger vores sider. Du kan få flere oplysninger om de førsteparts- og tredjepartscookies, som Honeywell bruger, ved at besøge vores [indstillingscenter for databeskyttelse](#)**.**

**Hvad med Flash-cookies eller lokale delte objekter?**  
  
Vi kan bruge Flash-cookies eller lokale delte objekter (»Flash LSO'er«) til at gemme dine hjemmesideindstillinger, tilpasse dit besøg, forhindre svindel og til andre handlinger i relation til siderne. Hvis du ikke ønsker, at der opbevares Flash LSO'er på din computer, kan du ændre indstillingerne i din Flash-afspiller til at blokere opbevaring af Flash LSO'er ved hjælp af værktøjerne i indstillingspanelet for hjemmesideopbevaring. Du kan også administrere Flash LSO'er ved at gå til indstillingspanelet for global opbevaring og følge instruktionerne (som kan omfatte instruktioner, der eksempelvis forklarer, hvordan du sletter eksisterende Flash LSO'er).

**Målrettet annoncering**

Vi sporer og analyserer både individualiseret brug og aggregeret statistiske oplysninger, der er relateret til din brug af vores sider. Vi samarbejder også med tredjeparter (såsom annoncører og annoncepartnere) om at vise annoncer på vores sider og om at administrere og vise annoncer på andre tredjepartssider. Disse tredjeparter bruger cookies og lignende sporingsteknologier til at indsamle og bruge visse oplysninger om dine onlineaktiviteter, enten på vores sider eller andre tredjepartssider, for at måle og spore effektiviteten af annoncer og vores onlinemarkedsføringsaktiviteter (f.eks. ved at indsamle data om, hvor mange gange du klikker på en af vores annoncer). Disse oplysninger kan bruges alene eller i kombination med oplysninger om dig, som vi indhenter fra andre kilder (såsom vores datapartnere), dine kontaktoplysninger og Honeywell-transaktionshistorik for at udlede dine interesser og levere dig målrettede annoncer og markedsføring, der er mere tilpasset til dig baseret på dine browseraktiviteter og udledte interesser (»Interessebaseret annoncering«). Sådan interessebaseret annoncering vil kun blive leveret, hvor det er tilladt i henhold til gældende lovgivning og i overensstemmelse med dine annonce-/markedsføringsindstillinger. Bemærk, at andre tredjeparters cookies og teknologier er underlagt deres respektive virksomheds specifikke databeskyttelsespolitikker, og ikke denne cookieerklæring.

**Sporing på tværs af enheder og side**

Vi, vores tjenesteleverandører og andre tredjeparter (såsom Google og andre annoncepartnere) kan bruge de oplysninger, vi indsamler om dig (enten direkte fra vores sider eller gennem en tredjepart), til at genkende dig online ved at identificere de enheder, du bruger. Vi bruger disse oplysninger til at vise dig [målrettet annoncering](#targetedadvertising-danish) på tværs af flere forskellige enheder (»matchning på tværs af enheder«) og sider (»sporing på tværs af sider«). Matchning på tværs af enheder og sporing på tværs af sider giver os mulighed for bedre at forstå vores kunders aktivitet, forbedre vores evne til at målrette og måle annoncekampagner (herunder begrænse antallet af gange, en bruger ser en annonce). Det hjælper os også med at matche enheder, så vi kan huske dine fravalg på tværs af alle de enheder, vi ved er forbundet med en fravalgt cookie.

**Deaktivering af cookies og fravalg af interessebaseret annoncering**

Du kan ændre dine indstillinger med hensyn modtagelse af cookies ved at bruge vores [indstillingscenter for databeskyttelse](#). Alternativt bør dine browserindstillinger give dig mulighed for at slette og/eller deaktivere hjemmesidecookies. Du kan få flere oplysninger om, hvordan du sletter dine cookies i din webbrowser ved at læse instruktionerne for din browser: [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en),  [Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies), [Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4468242/microsoft-edge-browsing-data-and-privacy), [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/clear-cookies-and-site-data-firefox), [Opera,](https://help.opera.com/en/latest/web-preferences/#cookies) Safari ([Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac), [iPhone, iPad eller iPod touch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265)).

Hvis du vælger at deaktivere cookies, kan det være, at sider ikke fungerer på samme måde. Nogle cookies er nødvendige for at registrere og respektere de valg, du har truffet med hensyn til ikke at blive kontaktet eller ikke at få tilføjet andre cookietyper til din enhed. Hvis du sletter cookies fra din computer, vil den cookie, der bruges til at genkende dine indstillinger, herunder indstillinger for interessebaseret annoncering, også blive slettet, hvorfor det kræves, at du foretager dine valg igen.

Brugere kan også fravælge tredjepartsannonceringsnetværk gennem brug af forskellige brancheforeningshjemmesider, såsom:

* Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) – [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/)
* Digital Advertising alliance (DAA) – (i) Globalt: [https://optout.aboutads.info/](https://optout.aboutads.info/); (ii) Europa: [http://youronlinechoices.eu/](http://youronlinechoices.eu/)

Hvis du fravælger interessebaseret annoncering, fravælger du disse virksomheders levering af interessebaseret indhold eller annoncer til dig, men det betyder ikke, at du ikke længere vil modtage annoncering via vores hjemmeside eller andre hjemmesider. Du kan stadig opleve at se Honeywell-annoncer, men Honeywell eller vores partnere vil ikke tilpasse disse annoncer til dig. Hvis du på noget tidspunkt ikke ønsker, at dine personlige oplysninger skal bruges til at tillade tredjeparter at vise annoncer eller til at tilpasse annoncer, der vises til dig, kan du også ændre dine indstillinger ved hjælp af de værktøjer, der leveres af tredjeparter, såsom: Google, Facebook og LinkedIn.

**Do Not Track (DNT)**

Nogle webbrowsere kan sende »Do-not-track«-signaler til sider, som du kommunikerer med. På grund af forskelle i, hvordan webbrowsere inkorporerer og aktiverer denne funktion, er det ikke altid klart, om brugerne har til hensigt at sende disse signaler, eller om de overhovedet er opmærksomme på dem.  Vi reagerer muligvis ikke på disse signaler. Du kan også deaktivere visse sporingsfunktioner (f.eks. ved at deaktivere cookies), og du har også mulighed for at fravælge målrettet annoncering ved at følge instruktionerne under afsnittet [Deaktivering af cookies og fravælge interessebaseret annoncering.](#disablingcookies-danish)

**Päivitetty: 11. kesäkuuta 2021**

Tässä Evästeilmoituksessa kuvataan, miten Honeywell International Inc. ja sen tytäryhtiöt (yhdessä ”**Honeywell**” tai ”**me**”) käyttää kävijöiden tai käyttäjien tietokoneeseen, mobiililaitteeseen tai tablettiin (”**Laitteet**”) asennettuja evästeitä tai vastaavia teknologioita sivustollamme tai tuotteissamme ja/tai sovelluksissamme (”**Sivustot**”).

Evästeet ja vastaavat teknologiat voivat käsitellä henkilötietoja. Lue lisää:

* [Tietosuojalausunto](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/privacy-statement#finnish), josta saat lisätietoja henkilötietojesi käsittelystä ja rekisteröidyn oikeuksiesi käytöstä
* [Tietosuojakeskuksessa](#), jos haluat lisätietoja Sivustoillamme käytetyistä evästeistä tai tehdä muutoksia evästeasetuksiisi.

**Mitä evästeet ovat?**

Evästeet ovat pieniä tekstitiedostoja, joita Sivustomme sijoittavat Laitteisiisi. Kun tulet Sivustoillemme uudelleen, teknologiamme havaitsee evästeen ja tunnistaa sinut tai laitteesi ja muistaa tietoja sinusta, kuten kieliasetuksesi tai kirjautumistietosi. Käytämme myös kolmannen osapuolen evästeitä, joiden verkkotunnus poikkeaa omastamme. Nämä evästeet sallivat meidän, kyseisen kolmannen osapuolen ja joissakin tapauksissa muidenkin yhteisen evästeverkoston jäsenten tunnistaa sinut tai Laitteesi, kun käyt eri sivustoilla. Termi ”Evästeet” käsittää teksti-, pikseli-, gif- ja lokitiedostot, verkkomajakat ja muut seurantatekniikat, joita sijoitetaan Laitteisiisi.

**Käytössämme voi olla neljä evästetyyppiä:**

* **Välttämättömiä evästeitä** tarvitaan, jotta Sivustomme toimisivat ja voisivat tarjota sinulle pyytämiäsi palveluita ja tietoja. Välttämättömien evästeiden käyttöön ei vaadita palvelun käyttäjän suostumusta.
* **Toiminnalliset evästeet** mahdollistavat parannellun toiminnot ja personoinnin. Ne sallivat Sivustojemme esimerkiksi muistaa antamiasi tietoja, kuten kielivalinnan, ja tallentaa teknisiä tietoja, joista on hyötyä käyttäessäsi Sivustoja. Ne ovat joko meidän tai meille palveluita tuottavan kolmannen osapuolen asettamia. Jos et salli näitä evästeitä, jotkin tai kaikki näistä palveluista eivät ehkä toimi oikein.
* **Suorituskykyevästeet** keräävät tietoja Sivustojen käytöstäsi (esimerkiksi laskevat käyntejä ja tuloreittejä) ja antavat meille Sivustojen toiminnasta tietoa, jonka pohjalta voimme parantaa selailukokemustasi (esimerkiksi antamalla tietoa suosituimmista ja vähiten suosituista sivuistamme). Kaikki näiden evästeiden keräämä tieto tulee meille anonyymeina koosteina.
* **Mainonta-/kohdennusevästeet** keräävät tietoja aktiivisuudestasi verkossa. Ne tunnistavat kiinnostuksen kohteesi, jotta voimme luoda sinulle profiilin ja näyttää sopivampia mainoksia. Niiden toimintoihin kuuluu myös esimerkiksi saman mainoksen jatkuvan näytön estäminen, ilmoitusten oikein näkymisestä huolehtiminen sekä kiinnostuksen kohteisiisi perustuvien mainosten valinta.

Lisätietoja Honeywellin käyttämistä evästeistä löydät [Tietosuojakeskuksesta.](#)

**Miksi käytämme evästeitä ja vastaavia teknologioita?**

Evästeillä ja vastaavilla seurantateknologioilla on seuraavia tehtäviä:

* Asetustesi tallessapito
* Ne sallivat sisäänkirjautumisen ja tunnistautumisen, jotta pääset käyttämään Sivustoja ja siirtymään sivulta toiselle
* Ne suojaavat Sivustojamme muun muassa petosyrityksiltä
* Ne räätälöivät sinulle näytettävän informaation selainasetusten, kuten kielen ja sijainnin, perusteella
* Ne seuraavat käyttäjien liikkumista Sivustoilla ja keräävät tilastotietoa Sivuston käytöstäsi. Näin ymmärrämme paremmin Sivustomme suoriutumista ja saamme parannusideoita, joilla voimme esimerkiksi sujuvoittaa selailua ja tarjota sinulle relevantimpia palveluita.
* Ne tarjoavat meille informaatiota yritystoimintaan ja markkinointiin
* Ne seuraavat kävijöitä Sivustoillamme, sosiaalisen median sivuillamme, verkkomainoksissamme ja markkinointiviesteissämme sekä näissä tapahtuvaa vuorovaikutusta (esimerkiksi mitä mainoksia klikataan, tai onko käyttäjä avannut tai lähettänyt edelleen lähettämämme sähköpostin)
* [Kohdennettu mainonta](#targetedadvertising-finnish)
* [Seuranta yli laite- ja sivustorajojen](#crossdevice-finnish)

**Kuka käyttää evästeiden ja vastaavien seurantateknologioiden keräämää tietoa?**

Sivustojemme evästeisiin tallennettuja tietoja käytämme yksinomaan me itse (tai toimeksiannolla toimivat kolmannet osapuolet). Poikkeus tähän ovat kolmansien osapuolten evästeet, joita käyttävät ja hallinnoivat ulkopuoliset tahot, jotka ovat saaneet meiltä toimeksiannon parantaa palveluitamme ja navigointikokemustasi. Lisätietoja Honeywellin käyttämistä omista ja kolmannen osapuolen evästeistä on löydät [Tietosuojakeskuksestamme.](#)

**Entä Flash-evästeet (Local Shared Objects)?**  
  
Flash-evästeillä (Flash LSO) voimme tallentaa sivustomieltymyksesi, personoida sivustokäyntisi, estää petoksia ja toteuttaa muita sivustotoimintoja. Jos et halua, että laitteellesi tallennetaan Flash-evästeitä, voit käydä Flash Playerin asetuksissa estämässä niiden tallennuksen sivustotallennusasetusten paneelissa. Voit hallita Flash-LSO:ita myös laitteen tallennusasetuksissa seuraamalla ohjeita (niissä voidaan esimerkiksi neuvoa, miten poistat koneella jo olevat Flash LSO:t).

**Kohdennettu mainonta**

Seuraamme ja analysoimme Sivustojemme käytöstä kertovaa yksilöllistä dataa sekä koontitilastoja. Hyödynnämme myös ulkopuolisia kumppaneita (kuten mainostajia ja mainosalustoja) näyttääksemme Sivustoillamme muiden mainoksia ja omia mainoksiamme muiden sivustoilla. Nämä tahot käyttävät evästeitä ja vastaavia seurantateknologioita informaation keruuseen ja käyttöön verkkotoiminnastasi joko meidän Sivustoillamme tai muilla sivustoilla. Näin he mittaavat ja seuraavat mainonnan ja verkkomarkkinointimme tehoa (esimerkiksi laskemalla, montako kertaa klikkaat mainosta). Näitä tietoja voidaan hyödyntää sellaisenaan tai yhdessä muista lähteistä (kuten datakumppaneilta) saamiemme tietojen, yhteystietojesi ja Honeywell-tapahtumahistoriasi kanssa. Tältä pohjalta tarjotaan juuri sinulle verkkoselailuusi ja pääteltyihin kiinnostuksen kohteisiisi perustuvaa mainontaa ja markkinointia (räätälöityä mainontaa). Saat räätälöityjä mainoksia vain, jos sovellettava laki sen sallii ja olet antanut siihen luvan mainonta-/markkinointiasetuksissasi. Huomaa, että muiden kolmansien osapuolten evästeitä ja teknologioita säätelevät kunkin yrityksen oma tietosuojakäytäntö, ei tämä evästeilmoitus.

**Seuranta yli laite- ja sivustorajojen**

Me, palveluntuottajamme ja muut kolmannet osapuolet (kuten Google ja muut mainoskumppanit) voivat käyttää sinusta (joko Sivustollamme tai kolmannen osapuolen kautta) kerättyä informaatiota sinun tunnistamiseesi verkossa identifioimalla käyttämäsi Laitteet. Käytämme tätä informaatiota [kohdennettuun mainontaan](#targetedadvertising-finnish) useilla eri Laitteilla (seuranta yli laiterajojen) ja sivustoilla (seuranta yli sivustorajojen). Seuranta yli laiterajojen ja seuranta yli sivustorajojen antavat meille tilaisuuden ymmärtää paremmin asiakkaan toimintaa, kohdistaa viestit paremmin ja mitata mainoskampanjoita (sekä rajoittaa käyttäjäkohtaisia näyttökertoja). Se auttaa meitä myös tietämään, milloin Laitteet kuuluvat samalle käyttäjälle. Tällöin yhdellä laitteella oleva kieltoeväste tehoaa käyttäjän kaikissa Laitteissa.

**Evästeiden esto ja räätälöidyn mainonnan kielto**

Voit itse valita [Tietosuojakeskuksessamme](#) tai selaimesi asetuksissa, mitä evästeitä haluat sallia Laitteelle ja haluatko poistaa sivustoevästeitä. Lisätietoja evästeiden poistosta selaimen asetuksista löydät selainkohtaisista ohjeista: [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en), [Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies), [Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4468242/microsoft-edge-browsing-data-and-privacy), [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/clear-cookies-and-site-data-firefox), [Opera,](https://help.opera.com/en/latest/web-preferences/#cookies) Safari ([Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac), [iPhone, iPad tai iPod touch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265)).

Jos päätät estää evästeet, saatat huomata, että Sivustot eivät välttämättä toimi samalla tavalla. Jotkin evästeet ovat tarpeen, jotta tekemäsi valinnat tallentuvat: esimerkiksi yhteydenottokielto tai muiden evästetyyppien Laitteelle lisäämisen kielto. Jos poistat evästeet tietokoneelta, myös eväste, johon toiveesi mm. räätälöidyn mainonnan suhteen on tallennettu, poistetaan. Tällöin joudut tekemään samat valinnat uudelleen.

Käyttäjät voivat kieltää kolmansien osapuolten mainosverkostojen mainonnasta myös toimialajärjestöjen sivustoja hyödyntäen:

* Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) - [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/)
* Digital Advertising alliance (DAA) – (i) Globaalisti: [https://optout.aboutads.info/](https://optout.aboutads.info/); (ii) Euroopassa: [http://youronlinechoices.eu/](http://youronlinechoices.eu/)

Räätälöidyn mainonnan kielto estää näitä yrityksiä tarjoamasta sinulle kiinnostuksen kohteisiisi perustuvaa sisältöä tai mainoksia. Se ei kuitenkaan tarkoita, ettet enää näkisi mainontaa Sivustollamme tai muilla sivustoilla. Saatat edelleen nähdä Honeywellin mainoksia, mutta Honeywell tai kumppanimme eivät räätälöi niitä sinulle. Jos et halua henkilötietojasi käytettävän kolmansien osapuolten mainonnan sallimiseen tai näkemiesi mainosten personointiin, voit muuttaa asetuksiasi myös mm. seuraavissa palveluissa: Google, Facebook ja LinkedIn.

**Do Not Track (DNT)**

Joillakin verkkoselaimilla on valmius lähettää ”do-not-track”-signaali Sivustoille, joilla käyt. Koska eri selaimet toteuttavat ja aktivoivat tämän toiminnon eri tavoin, ei ole aina selvää, onko käyttäjä lähettänyt signaalin tietoisesti tai onko hän edes niistä tietoinen Emme välttämättä noudata näiden signaalien kehotusta. Voit myös estää tietyn seurantametodin (esimerkiksi evästeet) ja voit myös kieltäytyä kohdennetusta mainonnasta seuraamalla kohdan [Evästeiden esto ja räätälöidyn markkinoinnin kielto](#disablingcookies-finnish) ohjeita.

Nous utilisons également des Cookies tiers, qui sont des Cookies d’un domaine différent de celui du site Web que vous visitez et qui nous permettent, ainsi qu’au tiers propriétaire des Cookies et, dans certains cas, à d’autres participants des réseaux de Cookies, de vous identifier ou d’identifier votre appareil lorsque vous visitez différents sites Web. Nous utilisons le terme Cookies pour inclure un morceau de texte, des pixels, des gifs invisibles, des fichiers journaux, des balises Web ou d’autres technologies de suivi similaires qui sont placés sur vos Appareils.

**Il existe quatre types de Cookies que nous pouvons être amenés à utiliser:**

* **Les Cookies strictement nécessaires** sont indispensables au fonctionnement de nos Sites et pour vous fournir les services et informations que vous avez demandés. Les Cookies strictement nécessaires ne sont pas soumis à l’obligation de consentement.
* **Les Cookies fonctionnels** permettent d’améliorer la fonctionnalité et la personnalisation. Par exemple, ils permettent à nos Sites de se souvenir des informations que vous fournissez, par exemple vos préférences linguistiques, ainsi que de stocker des informations techniques utiles pour vos interactions avec nos Sites. Ils peuvent être définis par nos soins ou par des fournisseurs tiers dont nous avons ajouté les services sur nos Sites. Si vous n’autorisez pas ces Cookies, il est possible que certains ou tous ces services ne fonctionnent pas correctement.
* **Les cookies de performance** collectent des informations sur votre utilisation de nos Sites (par exemple, ils nous permettent de compter les visites et les sources de trafic) et nous aident à apprendre comment nos Sites fonctionnent afin que nous puissions apporter des améliorations pertinentes susceptibles d’améliorer votre expérience de navigation (par exemple, cela nous permet de savoir quelles pages sont les plus et les moins populaires). Toutes les informations que ces cookies collectent sont regroupées et sont donc anonymes.
* **Les Cookies publicitaires/de ciblage** collectent des données sur votre activité en ligne et identifient vos intérêts afin que nous puissions créer un profil vous concernant et proposer des publicités plus pertinentes en fonction de celui-ci. Ils permettent également d’éviter que les même publicités s’affichent continuellement, de s’assurer que les publicités sont affichées correctement et de sélectionner des publicités en fonction de vos intérêts.

Pour plus d’informations sur les Cookies utilisés par Honeywell, veuillez consulter notre [Centre de préférences en matière de confidentialité](#)

**Pourquoi utilisons-nous des Cookies et d’autres technologies similaires?**

Nous utilisons des Cookies et d’autres technologies de suivi similaires aux fins suivantes:

* Stocker vos préférences et paramètres;
* Vous permettre de vous connecter et de vous authentifier afin que vous puissiez accéder à nos Sites et vous déplacer d’une page à l’autre au sein de nos Sites;
* Sécuriser nos Sites, y compris la détection et la prévention de la fraude;
* Personnaliser les informations qui vous sont présentées en fonction de vos préférences de navigation, comme la langue et la région géographique;
* Surveiller les modèles de trafic des utilisateurs sur nos Sites et collecter des statistiques concernant l’utilisation de votre site Web pour nous aider à comprendre comment nos Sites fonctionnent et comment nous pouvons les améliorer à des fins telles que l’enrichissement de votre expérience de navigation et l’offre de services plus pertinents pour vous;
* Nous fournir des informations commerciales et marketing;
* Suivre les utilisateurs qui visitent, interagissent avec ou utilisent l’un(e) de nos sites, pages de réseaux sociaux, publicités en ligne et communications marketing (par exemple, les publicités sur lesquelles vous avez cliqué ou si un utilisateur a ouvert ou transféré un e-mail que nous lui avons envoyé); et
* [Publicité ciblée](#targetedadvertising-french); et
* [Suivi de plusieurs appareils et sites](#crossdevice-french).

**Qui utilise les informations stockées dans les Cookies et les technologies de suivi similaires?**

Les informations stockées dans les Cookies de nos sites sont utilisées exclusivement par nous (ou par des tiers agissant en notre nom), à l’exception des Cookies tiers qui sont utilisés et gérés par des tiers afin de fournir les services que nous demandons pour améliorer nos services et votre expérience lors de la navigation sur nos Sites. Pour de plus amples informations sur les Cookies propriétaires et tiers utilisés par Honeywell, veuillez visiter notre [Centre de préférences de confidentialité](#).

**Qu’en est-il des Cookies Flash ou des Objets locaux partagés?**  
  
Nous pouvons être amenés à utiliser des Cookies Flash ou des Objets locaux partagés (LSO Flash) pour stocker les préférences de votre site Web, personnaliser votre visite, prévenir la fraude et pour d’autres opérations du Site. Si vous ne souhaitez pas que des LSO Flash soient stockés sur votre ordinateur, vous pouvez modifier les paramètres de votre lecteur Flash de façon à bloquer le stockage des LSO Flash à l’aide des outils contenus dans le Panneau des paramètres de stockage du site Web. Vous pouvez également contrôler les LSO Flash en accédant au Panneau des paramètres de stockage globaux et en suivant les instructions (notamment celles expliquant comment supprimer les LSO Flash existants).

**Publicité ciblée**

Nous suivons et analysons à la fois l’utilisation individualisée et les informations statistiques agrégées liées à votre utilisation de nos Sites. Nous travaillons également en partenariat avec des tiers (tels que des annonceurs et des partenaires publicitaires) pour afficher de la publicité sur nos Sites, ainsi que gérer et diffuser de la publicité sur d’autres sites tiers. Ces tiers utilisent des Cookies et des technologies de suivi similaires pour collecter et utiliser certaines informations sur vos activités en ligne, que ce soit sur nos Sites ou sur d’autres sites tiers afin de mesurer et de suivre l’efficacité des publicités et de nos activités de marketing en ligne (par exemple, en collectant des données sur le nombre de fois où vous cliquez sur l’une de nos publicités). Ces informations peuvent être utilisées seules ou en combinaison avec des informations vous concernant que nous obtenons auprès d’autres sources (comme nos partenaires de données), vos coordonnées et l’historique des transactions Honeywell pour déduire vos intérêts et vous proposer des publicités et un marketing ciblés plus adaptés à vous en fonction de vos activités de navigation et de vos intérêts déduits («Publicités ciblées par centre d’intérêt»). Ces Publicités ciblées par centre d’intérêt ne seront diffusées que lorsque la loi applicable le permet et conformément à vos préférences en matière de publicité et de marketing. Veuillez noter que les Cookies et les technologies d’autres tiers sont régis par la politique de confidentialité spécifique de chaque société et non par le présent Avis relatif aux cookies.

**Suivi de plusieurs appareils et sites**

Nous, nos fournisseurs de services et d’autres tiers (tels que Google et d’autres partenaires publicitaires) pouvons utiliser les informations que nous recueillons à votre sujet (que ce soit directement à partir de nos Sites ou auprès d’un tiers) dans le but de vous reconnaître en ligne en identifiant les Appareils que vous utilisez. Nous utilisons ces informations pour vous proposer des [publicités ciblées](#targetedadvertising-french) sur plusieurs Appareils et sites différents («correspondance entre appareils») et sites («suivi intersite»). La correspondance entre appareils et le suivi intersite nous permettent de mieux comprendre l’activité de nos clients, d’améliorer notre capacité à cibler et à mesurer les campagnes publicitaires (y compris en limitant le nombre de fois où un utilisateur voit une publicité). Cela nous aide également à faire correspondre les Appareils afin de pouvoir faciliter vos choix de désinscription sur tous les Appareils dont nous savons qu’ils sont connectés à un Cookie de désactivation.

**Désactivation des Cookies et des Publicités ciblées par centre d’intérêt**

Vous pouvez faire des choix concernant la réception de Cookies en utilisant notre [Centre de préférences de confidentialité](#) ou en vous servant des paramètres de votre navigateur qui doivent vous permettre de supprimer et/ou de désactiver les Cookies de sites Web. Pour plus d’informations sur la suppression de vos Cookies dans votre navigateur Web, reportez-vous aux instructions de votre navigateur: [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en), [Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies), [Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4468242/microsoft-edge-browsing-data-and-privacy), [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/clear-cookies-and-site-data-firefox), [Opera,](https://help.opera.com/en/latest/web-preferences/#cookies) Safari ([Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac), [iPhone, iPad ou iPod touch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265)).

Si vous choisissez de désactiver les Cookies, vous constaterez peut-être que les Sites ne fonctionnent plus de la même manière. Certains Cookies sont nécessaires pour enregistrer et respecter les choix que vous avez faits, par exemple le refus d’être contacté ou d’avoir d’autres types de Cookies ajoutés à votre Appareil. Si vous supprimez des Cookies de votre ordinateur, le Cookie utilisé pour reconnaître vos préférences, y compris les Publicités ciblées par centre d’intérêt, sera également supprimé, ce qui vous obligera à effectuer à nouveau vos choix.

Les utilisateurs peuvent également se retirer des réseaux publicitaires tiers en utilisant divers sites Web d’associations professionnelles tels que:

* Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) - [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/)
* Digital Advertising alliance (DAA) – (i) Monde: [https://optout.aboutads.info/](https://optout.aboutads.info/); (ii) Europe: [http://youronlinechoices.eu/](http://youronlinechoices.eu/)

Lorsque vous désactivez les Publicités ciblées par centre d’intérêt, vous ne recevez plus de contenus ou de publicités ciblées par centre d’intérêt de la part de ces sociétés, mais cela ne signifie pas que vous ne recevrez plus de publicités sur notre site Web ou d’autres sites Web. Vous verrez peut-être encore des publicités Honeywell, mais celles-ci ne seront pas personnalisées pour vous par Honeywell ou nos partenaires. Si, à tout moment, vous ne souhaitez pas que vos informations personnelles soient utilisées pour permettre à des tiers d’afficher des publicités ou de personnaliser les publicités que vous voyez, vous pouvez également ajuster vos paramètres en utilisant les outils fournis par des tiers tels que Google, Facebook et LinkedIn.

**Ne pas suivre (DNT)**

Certains navigateurs Web peuvent transmettre des signaux «ne pas suivre» aux Sites avec lesquels vous communiquez. En raison des différences dans la façon dont les navigateurs Web intègrent et activent cette fonction, il n’est pas toujours possible de savoir si les utilisateurs ont l’intention de transmettre ces signaux ou s’ils en connaissent même l’existence. Nous ne pouvons pas agir en réponse à ces signaux. Vous pouvez également désactiver certains suivis (par exemple en désactivant des Cookies) ainsi que les publicités ciblées en suivant les instructions de la section [Désactivation des Cookies et des Publicités ciblées par centre d’intérêt](#disablingcookies-french)

Le présent Avis relatif aux témoins décrit la façon dont Honeywell International Inc. et ses sociétés affiliées (collectivement "**Honeywell"**, "**nous"**) utilisent les témoins et des technologies similaires installés sur les appareils, par exemple les ordinateurs, appareils mobiles ou tablettes ("**Appareils"**) des visiteurs ou des utilisateurs de notre site Web, de nos produits ou de nos applications ("**Sites"**).

Les témoins et technologies similaires peuvent traiter des renseignements personnels. Veuillez visiter:

* notre [Déclaration de confidentialité](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/privacy-statement#french-canadian) si vous souhaitez obtenir plus d’information sur la façon dont nous traitons vos renseignements personnels et afin de savoir comment exercer vos droits en tant que personne concernée.
* notre [Centre de préférences en matière de confidentialité](#) pour plus d’information sur les témoins précis que nous utilisons sur nos Sites et pour gérer vos préférences en matière de témoins.

**Que sont les témoins?**

Les témoins sont de petits fichiers texte que nos Sites placent sur vos Appareils. Lorsque vous visitez à nouveau nos Sites, nos technologies se connectent automatiquement aux témoins afin de vous identifier ou d’identifier votre Appareil et de se souvenir des informations vous concernant, par exemple vos préférences linguistiques ou vos informations de connexion. Nous utilisons également des témoins tiers, qui sont des témoins d’un domaine différent de celui du site Web que vous visitez et qui nous permettent, ainsi qu’au tiers propriétaire des témoins et, dans certains cas, à d’autres participants des réseaux de témoins, de vous identifier ou d’identifier votre Appareil lorsque vous visitez différents sites Web. Nous utilisons le terme «témoin» pour inclure un morceau de texte, des pixels, des GIF invisibles, des fichiers journaux, des balises Web ou d’autres technologies de suivi similaires qui sont placés sur vos Appareils.

**Nous pourrions utiliser quatre types de témoins:**

* **Les témoins strictement nécessaires** sont indispensables au fonctionnement de nos Sites et pour vous fournir les services et informations que vous avez demandés. Les témoins strictement nécessaires ne sont pas soumis à l’obligation de consentement.
* **Les témoins fonctionnels** permettent d’améliorer la fonctionnalité et la personnalisation.

Ils peuvent être définis par nos soins ou par des fournisseurs tiers dont nous avons ajouté les services sur nos Sites. Si vous n’autorisez pas ces témoins, il est possible que certains services ou même tous les services ne fonctionnent pas correctement.
* **Les témoins de performance** collectent des informations sur votre utilisation de nos Sites (par exemple, ils nous permettent de compter les visites et les sources de trafic) et nous aident à évaluer le rendement de nos Sites afin que nous puissions apporter des améliorations pertinentes susceptibles d’améliorer votre expérience de navigation (par exemple, cela nous permet de savoir quelles pages sont les plus et les moins populaires). Toutes les informations que ces témoins collectent sont regroupées et donc anonymes.
* **Les témoins publicitaires/de ciblage** collectent des données sur votre activité en ligne et déterminent vos intérêts afin que nous puissions créer un profil vous concernant et proposer des publicités plus pertinentes en fonction de celui-ci. Ils permettent également d’éviter que les mêmes publicités s’affichent continuellement, de s’assurer que les publicités sont affichées correctement et de sélectionner des publicités en fonction de vos intérêts.

**Aktualisierung: 11. Juni 2021**  

Dieser Cookie-Hinweis beschreibt, wie Honeywell International Inc. und die verbundenen Unternehmen (zusammen "**Honeywell**“, "**uns**“ oder "**wir**“) Cookies und ähnliche Technologien verwenden, die auf Geräten ("**Geräte**“) der Besucher oder Benutzer unserer Website, Produkte und/oder Anwendungen ("**Websites**“) installiert sind.

Cookies und ähnliche Technologien können personenbezogene Daten verarbeiten. Bitte besuchen Sie:

* unsere [Datenschutzerklärung](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/privacy-statement#german), wenn Sie weitere Informationen darüber erhalten möchten, wie wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten verarbeiten und wie Sie von Ihren Rechten als betroffene Person Gebrauch machen können
* unser [Center für Datenschutzeinstellungen](#), wenn Sie weitere Informationen zu den spezifischen Cookies, die wir auf unseren Websites verwenden, und zur Verwaltung Ihrer Cookie-Einstellungen erhalten möchten.

**Was sind Cookies?**

Cookies sind kleine Textdateien, die unsere Websites auf Ihren Geräten ablegen. Wenn Sie unsere Websites erneut besuchen, stellen unsere Technologien automatisch eine Verbindung mit dem Cookie her, um Sie oder Ihr Gerät zu identifizieren und Informationen zu Ihnen abzurufen, z. B. Ihre Spracheinstellungen oder Anmeldeinformationen. Darüber hinaus verwenden wir Cookies von Drittanbietern. Dabei handelt es sich um Cookies von einer anderen Domäne als der Domäne der von Ihnen besuchten Website. Dies ermöglicht es uns, dem Drittanbieter, von dem die Cookies stammen, und unter Umständen anderen Teilnehmern in Cookie-Netzwerken, Sie oder Ihr Gerät zu identifizieren, wenn Sie verschiedene Websites besuchen. Das Wort „Cookies“ umfasst Text, Pixel, transparente GIFs, Protokolldateien, Web-Beacons oder andere ähnliche Nachverfolgungstechnologien, die auf Ihren Geräten abgelegt werden.

**Es gibt vier Arten von Cookies, die wir möglicherweise verwenden:**

* **Absolut notwendige Cookies** sind notwendig, damit unsere Websites funktionieren und wir Ihnen die angeforderten Services und Informationen bereitstellen können. Absolut notwendige Cookies sind von der Zustimmungserfordernis ausgenommen.
* **Funktions-Cookies** ermöglichen eine bessere Funktionalität und Personalisierung. Beispielsweise können unsere Websites mit diesen Cookies von Ihnen angegebene Informationen, z. B. Ihre Spracheinstellungen, sowie technische Informationen speichern, die für Ihre Interaktionen mit unseren Websites nützlich sind. Sie können von uns oder von Drittanbietern gesetzt werden, deren Services wir unseren Websites hinzugefügt haben. Wenn Sie diese Cookies nicht erlauben, funktionieren möglicherweise einzelne oder alle Services nicht richtig.
* **Leistungs-Cookies** erfassen Informationen über Ihre Nutzung unserer Websites (z. B. ermöglichen sie uns, Besuche und Datenverkehrsquellen zu zählen) und helfen uns dabei, mehr über die Leistung unserer Websites zu erfahren. Dadurch können wir wichtige Verbesserungen vornehmen, die Ihre Browsererfahrung verbessern könnten (z. B. erfahren wir durch diese Cookies, welche Seiten am beliebtesten und welche am wenigsten beliebt sind). Alle von diesen Cookies erfassten Informationen werden aggregiert und sind daher anonym.
* **Werbe-/Targeting-Cookies** erfassen Informationen zu Ihren Online-Aktivitäten und identifizieren Ihre Interessen, sodass wir ein Profil für Sie erstellen und Ihnen Werbung anzeigen können, die besser zu Ihnen passt. Darüber hinaus erfüllen sie weitere Funktionen. Beispielsweise verhindern sie, dass laufend dieselben Werbeanzeigen angezeigt werden, stellen sicher, dass Werbeanzeigen korrekt dargestellt werden und wählen Werbeanzeigen basierend auf Ihren Interessen aus.

Weitere Informationen zu den von Honeywell verwendeten Cookies finden Sie in unserem [Center für Datenschutzeinstellungen.](#)

**Warum verwenden wir Cookies und ähnliche Technologien?**

Wir verwenden Cookies und andere ähnliche Nachverfolgungstechnologien für die folgenden Zwecke:

* Speichern Ihrer Einstellungen;
* Gewähren Ihrer Anmeldung und Authentifizierung, damit Sie auf unsere Websites zugreifen und innerhalb unserer Websites von Seite zu Seite navigieren können;
* Sichern unserer Websites, einschließlich der Erkennung und Vermeidung von Betrug;
* Anpassen der Ihnen angezeigten Informationen basierend auf Ihren Browservoreinstellungen, wie beispielsweise Sprache und Region
* Überwachen der Datenverkehrsmuster der Benutzer innerhalb unserer Websites und Erfassen von Statistiken zu Ihrer Website-Nutzung, um mehr über die Leistung unserer Websites und darüber zu erfahren, wie wir unsere Websites verbessern können, um beispielsweise Ihr Browsererlebnis verbessern und Services anbieten zu können, die besser zu Ihnen passen;
* Erfassen von geschäftlichen und Marketinginformationen;
* Nachverfolgen von Benutzern, die unsere Websites, Social-Media-Seiten, Online-Werbeanzeigen und Marketingkommunikation besuchen, nutzen oder mit diesen interagieren (z. B. Informationen dazu, auf welche Werbeanzeigen geklickt wurde oder ob ein Benutzer eine E-Mail, die wir ihm gesendet haben, geöffnet oder weitergeleitet hat); und
* [Gezielte Werbung](#targetedadvertising-german); sowie
* [Geräte- und websiteübergreifende Nachverfolgung](#crossdevice-german).

**Wer verwendet die in Cookies und ähnlichen Nachverfolgungstechnologien gespeicherten Informationen?**

Die in den Cookies unserer Websites gespeicherten Informationen werden ausschließlich von uns (oder von Drittanbietern, die in unserem Auftrag arbeiten) verwendet. Eine Ausnahme hierzu stellen die Drittanbieter-Cookies dar. Diese werden von externen Parteien verwendet und verwaltet, um von uns angeforderte Services bereitzustellen, mit denen wir unsere Services und Ihre Erfahrung bei der Navigation auf unseren Websites verbessern möchten. Weitere Informationen zu den von Honeywell verwendeten Erstanbieter- und Drittanbieter-Cookies finden Sie in unserem [Center für Datenschutzeinstellungen](#).

**Was ist mit Flash-Cookies und lokal freigegebenen Objekten?**

Möglicherweise verwenden wir Flash-Cookies oder lokal freigegebene Objekte (Local Shared Objects, „Flash-LSOs“), um Ihre Website-Einstellungen zu speichern, Ihren Besuch zu personalisieren, Betrugsaktivitäten zu verhindern oder andere Website-Vorgänge auszuführen. Wenn keine Flash-LSOs auf Ihrem Computer gespeichert werden sollen, können Sie die Einstellungen Ihres Flash Players mit den Tools in den Website-Speichereinstellungen entsprechend anpassen. Darüber hinaus können Sie Flash-LSOs kontrollieren, indem Sie zu den globalen Speichereinstellungen navigieren und die dort aufgeführten Anweisungen befolgen (dies kann Anweisungen umfassen, in denen beispielsweise das Löschen von vorhandenen Flash-LSOs erläutert wird).

**Gezielte Werbung**

Wir erfassen und analysieren sowohl die individuelle Nutzung als auch aggregierte Informationen zu Ihrer Nutzung unserer Websites. Darüber hinaus arbeiten wir mit Drittanbietern (wie beispielsweise Werbetreibenden und Anzeigenpartnern) zusammen, um Werbung auf unseren Websites anzuzeigen und Werbung auf den Websites von Drittanbietern zu verwalten und bereitzustellen. Diese Drittanbieter verwenden Cookies und ähnliche Nachverfolgungstechnologien, um bestimmte Informationen über Ihre Online-Aktivitäten auf unseren Websites oder anderen Websites von Drittanbietern zu erfassen und zu verwenden, um die Effektivität von Werbeanzeigen und unseren Online-Marketingaktivitäten zu messen und nachzuverfolgen (beispielsweise indem Daten darüber erfasst werden, wie oft Sie auf eine unserer Werbeanzeigen klicken). Diese Informationen können alleine oder in Kombination mit Informationen über Sie verwendet werden, die wir über andere Quellen (wie unsere Datenpartner), Ihre Kontaktinformationen und den Transaktionsverlauf bei Honeywell erhalten, um Rückschlüsse über Ihre Interessen zu ziehen und Ihnen basierend auf Ihren Browser-Aktivitäten und den abgeleiteten Interessen gezielte Werbeanzeigen und Marketingaktionen bereitzustellen, die besser auf sie zugeschnitten sind („interessenbezogene Werbung“). Diese interessenbezogene Werbung wird nur soweit nach geltendem Recht zulässig und entsprechend Ihren Einstellungen für Werbung/Marketing bereitgestellt. Bitte beachten Sie, dass die Cookies und Technologien anderer Drittanbieter der spezifischen Datenschutzrichtlinie des jeweiligen Unternehmens und nicht diesem Cookie-Hinweis unterliegen.

**Geräte- und websiteübergreifende Nachverfolgung**

Wir, unsere Dienstanbieter und andere Drittanbieter (wie beispielsweise Google und andere Anzeigenpartner) können die (direkt über unsere Websites oder über einen Drittarbeiter) über Sie erfassten Informationen verwenden, um die von Ihnen verwendeten Geräte zu identifizieren und Sie online wiederzuerkennen. Wir verwenden diese Informationen, um Ihnen [gezielte Werbung](#targetedadvertising-german) auf verschiedenen Geräten („geräteübergreifender Abgleich“) und Websites („websiteübergreifende Nachverfolgung“) bereitzustellen. Durch den geräteübergreifenden Abgleich und die websiteübergreifende Nachverfolgung können wir die Aktivitäten unserer Kunden besser verstehen, unsere Fähigkeit zur gezielten Werbung verbessern und Anzeigenkampagnen messen (dies umfasst die Beschränkung der Häufigkeit, mit der eine Werbung einem Benutzer angezeigt wird). Darüber hinaus helfen uns diese Maßnahmen bei der Zuordnung von Geräten, sodass wir Ihre Abwahloptionen auf allen Geräten übernehmen können, die mit einem abgewählten Cookie verbunden sind.

**Deaktivieren von Cookies und Abmelden von interessenbezogener Werbung**

Sie können festlegen, ob Sie Cookies erhalten möchten – entweder über unser [Center für Datenschutzeinstellungen](#) oder alternativ, indem Sie in Ihren Browsereinstellungen Website-Cookies löschen und/oder deaktivieren. Weitere Informationen zum Löschen der Cookies in Ihrem Webbrowser finden Sie in den Anweisungen zu Ihrem Browser: [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en),  [Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies), [Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4468242/microsoft-edge-browsing-data-and-privacy), [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/clear-cookies-and-site-data-firefox), [Opera](https://help.opera.com/en/latest/web-preferences/#cookies), Safari ([Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac), [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265), [iPad](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265), or [iPod touch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265)).

Wenn Sie Cookies deaktivieren, funktionieren Websites möglicherweise nicht mehr wie gewohnt. Einige Cookies sind zum Speichern Ihrer Einstellungen in Bezug darauf, dass Sie nicht kontaktiert werden möchten oder Ihrem Gerät keine anderen Arten von Cookies hinzugefügt werden sollen, erforderlich. Wenn Sie Cookies von Ihrem Computer löschen, wird auch das Cookie gelöscht, das zum Speichern Ihrer Einstellungen einschließlich interessenbezogener Werbung verwendet wird, sodass Sie diese Einstellungen erneut festlegen müssen.

Benutzer können sich auch über die Websites von verschiedenen Wirtschaftsverbänden von Drittanbietern-Werbenetzwerken abmelden, z. B.:

* Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) – [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/)
* Digital Advertising alliance (DAA) – (i) Global: [https://optout.aboutads.info/](https://optout.aboutads.info/); (ii) Europa: [http://youronlinechoices.eu/](http://youronlinechoices.eu/)

Wenn Sie sich von interessenbezogener Werbung abmelden, werden Ihnen von diesen Unternehmen keine interessenbezogenen Inhalte oder Anzeigen mehr bereitgestellt. Es bedeutet jedoch nicht, dass Sie über unsere Website oder andere Websites keine Werbung mehr erhalten werden. Ihnen werden möglicherweise weiterhin Anzeigen von Honeywell angezeigt.

**Frissítve: 2021. június 11.**

A jelen cookie-kkal kapcsolatos közlemény ismerteti, hogy a Honeywell International Inc. és leányvállalatai (együttesen „"**Honeywell**”, "**mi**” vagy "**minket**”) hogyan használnak cookie-kat és hasonló, a weboldalunk, a termékeink és/vagy alkalmazásaink ("**Webhelyek**”) látogatói vagy felhasználói számítógépére, mobileszközére vagy táblagépére ("**Eszközök**”) telepített technológiákat.

A cookie-k és hasonló technológiák személyes adatokat dolgozhatnak fel. Kérjük, tekintse meg a következőt:

* [Adatvédelmi nyilatkozatunk](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/privacy-statement#hungarian) – ha további információt szeretne kapni arról, hogy miként dolgozunk fel személyes adatait, illetve hogyan gyakorolhatja érintetti jogait
* [Adatvédelmi beállításközpontunk](#) – ha további információt szeretne kapni a Webhelyeinken használt adott cookie-król, illetve kezelni szeretné a cookie-beállításokat.

**Mik azok a cookie-k?**

A cookie-k kis szövegfájlok, amelyeket Webhelyeink az Ön Eszközein helyeznek el. Amikor újból felkeresi Webhelyeinket, technológiáink automatikusan csatlakoznak a cookie-hoz, hogy azonosítsák Önt vagy az Ön Eszközét, és betöltsék az Önnel kapcsolatos információkat, például a nyelvi preferenciákat vagy a bejelentkezési információkat. Harmadik féltől származó cookie-kat is használunk. amelyek a meglátogatott webhely domainjétől eltérő domainből származó cookie-k, és amelyek lehetővé teszik számunkra, a cookie-k tulajdonosa számára, illetve bizonyos esetekben a cookie-hálózatok más résztvevői számára, hogy azonosítsák Önt vagy az Ön Eszközét, amikor különböző webhelyeket keres fel. A „Cookie-k” szóval szöveget, képpontokat, átlátszó GIF-eket, naplófájlokat, webjelzőket vagy más hasonló, az Ön Eszközére kerülő nyomkövetési technológiát jelölünk.

**Négyféle cookie-t használhatunk:**

* **Alapvető fontosságú cookie-k** – a Webhelyeink működéséhez, és az Ön által kért szolgáltatások és információk biztosításához szükségesek. Az alapvető fontosságú cookie-kra nem vonatkozik beleegyezés-kérési követelmény.
* **Funkcionális cookie-k** – lehetővé teszik a speciális funkciók biztosítását és a személyre szabást. Például lehetővé teszik a Webhelyek számára az Ön által biztosított információk – pl. a nyelvi beállításokat – megjegyzését, valamint a webhelyeinken végzett műveletekhez hasznos technikai jellegű információkat tárolják. Ezeket mi vagy olyan külső szolgáltatók állíthatják be, amelyek szolgáltatásait hozzáadtuk a Webhelyeinkhez. Ha nem engedélyezi ezeket a cookie-kat, előfordulhat, hogy a szolgáltatások vagy egy részük nem fog megfelelően működni.
* **Teljesítménymérési cookie-k** – információkat gyűjtenek a Webhelyeink Ön általi használatáról (például lehetővé teszik számunkra a látogatások számának és a forgalmi forrásoknak a mérését), valamint segítenek felmérni Webhelyeink teljesítményét, hogy megfelelő, a böngészési élményt fokozó fejlesztéseket hajthassunk végre (például lehetővé teszik számunkra annak megállapítását, hogy mely oldalak a legnépszerűbbek és a legkevésbé népszerűek). A cookie-k által összegyűjtött összes információt összesített formában kezeljük, így névtelen.
* **Hirdetési/célzási cookie-k** – adatokat gyűjtenek az Ön online tevékenységéről, és azonosítják érdeklődési köreit, hogy ennek alapján profilt hozhassunk létre Önről, melynek alapján relevánsabb hirdetéseket tudunk megjeleníteni. Olyan funkciókat is ellátnak, mint például az azonos hirdetések ismételt megjelenésének megakadályozása, a hirdetések megfelelő megjelenítésének biztosítása, valamint az Ön érdeklődésének megfelelő hirdetések kiválasztása.

Ha további információt szeretne kapni a Honeywell által használt cookie-król, látogasson el az [Adatvédelmi beállításközpontba.](#)

**Miért használunk cookie-kat és hasonló technológiákat?**

A cookie-kat és hasonló nyomkövetési technológiákat a következő célokra használjuk:

* a preferenciák és beállítások tárolásához;
* az Ön bejelentkezésének és hitelesítésének lehetővé tételéhez annak érdekében, hogy hozzáférhessen Webhelyeinkhez, illetve navigálhasson a Webhelyeink oldalai között;
* a Webhelyeink védelméhez, többek között a csalások felderítéséhez és megelőzéséhez;
* az Önnek megjelenített információk böngészési beállításai – például a nyelv és a földrajzi régió – alapján történő személyre szabásához;
* a felhasználók Webhelyeinken belüli forgalmi mintáinak megfigyeléséhez, a webhelyek használatára vonatkozó statisztikák gyűjtéséhez, a Webhelyeink teljesítményének, valamint annak megismeréséhez, hogy hogyan javíthatjuk Webhelyeinket többek között a böngészési élmény javításához és az Ön számára relevánsabb szolgáltatások biztosításához;
* üzleti és marketinginformációk biztosításához;
* azoknak a felhasználóknak a nyomon követéséhez, akik megtekintik vagy felkeresik bármelyik Webhelyünket, közösségi médiabeli oldalunkat, online hirdetésünket és marketingkommunikációinkat, illetve bármilyen műveletet végeznek ezekkel (például annak kiderítéséhez, hogy mely hirdetésekre kattintanak rá a felhasználók, vagy annak észleléséhez, hogy a felhasználó megnyitott vagy továbbított egy tőlünk kapott e-mailt); valamint
* [célzott hirdetéshez; és](#targetedadvertising-hung)
* [eszközök közötti és webhelyek közötti nyomon követéshez.](#crossdevice-hung)

**Ki használja a cookie-kban és hasonló nyomkövetési technológiákban tárolt információkat?**

A Webhelyeink cookie-jaiban tárolt információkat kizárólag mi (vagy a nevünkben eljáró harmadik felek) használjuk fel, kivéve a harmadik féltől származó cookie-kat, amelyeket külső felek használnak és kezelnek a szolgáltatásaink, valamint az Ön Webhelyeinken történő navigációs élményének javítása érdekében általunk igényelt szolgáltatások nyújtásához. Ha további információt szeretne olvasni a Honeywell által használt saját és harmadik féltől származó cookie-król, látogasson el az [Adatvédelmi beállításközpontba](#)**.**

**Mi a helyzet a Flash-cookie-kkal vagy a helyi megosztott objektumokkal?**  
  
Flash-cookie-kat vagy helyi megosztott objektumokat („Flash LSO”) használhatunk az Ön webhelybeállításainak tárolására, a látogatása személyre szabására, a csalások megelőzésére és a webhely egyéb műveleteihez. Ha nem szeretné, hogy Flash LSO-kat tároljunk a számítógépén, a Flash-lejátszó beállításaiban letilthatja a Flash LSO-k tárolását a Website Storage Settings Panelen rendelkezésre álló eszközökkel. A Flash LSO-kat úgy is vezérelheti, hogy megnyitja a Global Storage Settings Panelt, és követi az utasításokat (amelyek többek között a meglévő Flash LSO-k törlésére vonatkozó utasításokat is tartalmazhatnak).

**Célzott hirdetés**

Nyomon követjük és elemezzük mind a Webhelyeink Ön általi használatával kapcsolatos egyedi felhasználást, mind az összesített statisztikai információkat. Harmadik felekkel (például hirdetőkkel és hirdetési partnerekkel) is együttműködünk a hirdetések Webhelyeinken történő megjelenítéséhez, valamint a hirdetések harmadik felek webhelyein történő kezeléséhez és megjelenítéséhez. Az ilyen harmadik felek cookie-kat és hasonló nyomkövetési technológiákat használnak bizonyos, az Ön online tevékenységeivel kapcsolatos információk gyűjtésére és felhasználására – történjenek ezek a tevékenységek akár a Webhelyeinken, akár harmadik felek webhelyein –, a hirdetések és az online marketingtevékenységünk hatékonyságának mérése és nyomon követése (például adatokat gyűjtünk arról, hogy hány alkalommal kattint rá Ön valamelyik hirdetésünkre). Ezeket az információkat önmagukban vagy az Önről más forrásokból (például adatpartnereinktől) beszerzett információkkal, az Ön elérhetőségi adataival és a Honeywell tranzakciós előzményadataival együtt használhatjuk fel arra, hogy következtessünk az Ön érdeklődési köreire, és olyan célzott hirdetéseket és marketinget biztosíthassunk Önnek, amelyek nagyobb mértékben Önre vannak szabva a böngészési tevékenységei és a kikövetkeztetett érdeklődési körei alapján („Érdeklődésen alapuló hirdetések”). Az ilyen érdeklődésen alapuló hirdetéseket csak akkor jelenítjük meg, ha ezt a hatályos törvények megengedi, és az Ön hirdetési/marketingbeállításaiban engedélyezve van. Felhívjuk figyelmét, hogy a harmadik felek cookie-jaira és technológiáira az egyes vállalatok saját adatvédelmi irányelvei vonatkoznak, nem pedig a jelen a cookie-kkal kapcsolatos értesítés.

**Eszközök közötti és webhelyek közötti nyomon követés**

Mi, szolgáltatóink és más harmadik felek (például a Google és más hirdetési partnerek) felhasználhatják az Önről gyűjtött információkat (akár közvetlenül a Webhelyeinkről, akár egy harmadik féltől) annak érdekében, hogy online felismerhessük Önt az Ön által használt Eszközök azonosításával. Ezeket az információkat arra használjuk, hogy [célzott hirdetéseket](#targetedadvertising-hung) jelenítsünk meg több különböző Eszközön („eszközök közötti egyeztetés”) és webhelyeken („webhelyek közötti nyomon követés”). Az eszközök közötti egyeztetés és a webhelyek közötti nyomon követés lehetővé teszi számunkra, hogy jobban megértsük ügyfeleink tevékenységét, javítsuk a hirdetési kampányok célzását és mérését (ideértve annak korlátozását is, hogy egy felhasználó számára hányszor jelenik meg egy adott hirdetés). Segít abban is, hogy összehangoljuk az Eszközöket, hogy megkönnyítsük az Ön leiratkozását az összes olyan Eszközön, amelyről tudjuk, hogy egy olyan cookie-hoz kapcsolódik, melyről Ön leiratkozott.

**A cookie-k letiltása és az érdeklődésen alapuló hirdetésről való leiratkozás**

[Az Adatvédelmi beállításközpontunk](#) használatával adhatja meg a cookie-k fogadásával kapcsolatos döntéseit, továbbá a böngészője beállításai is lehetővé teszik a webhelyek cookie-jainak törlését és/vagy letiltását. A cookie-k böngészőben történő törléséről további információt az adott böngésző dokumentációjában talál: [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=hu), [Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/hu-hu/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies), [Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/hu-hu/help/4468242/microsoft-edge-browsing-data-and-privacy), [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/hu-hu/kb/clear-cookies-and-site-data-firefox), [Opera,](https://help.opera.com/en/latest/web-preferences/#cookies) Safari ([Mac](https://support.apple.com/hu-hu/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac), [iPhone, iPad és iPod touch](https://support.apple.com/hu-hu/HT201265)).

Ha a cookie-k letiltása mellett dönt, előfordulhat, hogy a Webhelyek nem ugyanúgy működnek, mint cookie-kkal. Egyes cookie-kra azért van szükség, hogy rögzítsük és tiszteletben tartsuk azon döntéseit, amelyeket a kapcsolatfelvétel letiltásával, illetve más típusú cookie-k Eszközéhez való hozzáadása tekintetében hozott. Ha törli a cookie-kat a számítógépről, akkor törlődik a preferenciái (többek között az érdeklődésen alapuló hirdetéssel kapcsolatos beállításai) tárolására használt cookie is, így ismét meg kell adnia beállításait.

A felhasználók különféle szakmai szövetségek webhelyeinek, például a következőknek a használatával is letilthatják a harmadik felek hirdetési hálózatait:

* Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) – [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/)
* Digital Advertising alliance (DAA) – (i) globálisan: [https://optout.aboutads.info/](https://optout.aboutads.info/); (ii) Európában: [http://youronlinechoices.eu/](http://youronlinechoices.eu/)

Az érdeklődésen alapuló hirdetésekről való leiratkozással letiltja e társaságok érdeklődésen alapuló tartalmainak vagy hirdetéseinek megjelenítését, de ez nem jelenti azt, hogy Ön a továbbiakban nem fog hirdetéseket lázni a webhelyünkön vagy más webhelyeken. Továbbra is láthatja a Honeywell hirdetéseit, de ezeket nem fogják személyre szabni a Honeywell vagy partnerei. Ha bármikor úgy dönt, hogy nem szeretné, ha személyes adatait felhasználnák arra, hogy harmadik felek számára lehetővé tegyék a hirdetések megjelenítését, vagy személyre szabják az Ön számára megjelenített hirdetéseket, akkor a beállításokat olyan harmadik felek által biztosított eszközök használatával is módosíthatja, mint pl. a Google, a Facebook és a LinkedIn.

**Do Not Track (DNT)**

Egyes webböngészők "do not track” (követés letiltása) jeleket továbbíthatnak azoknak a Webhelyeknek, amelyekkel Ön kommunikál. Mivel az egyes webböngészők különbözőképpen valósítják meg és aktiválják ezt a funkciót, nem mindig egyértelmű, hogy a felhasználók szándékosan továbbítják-e ezeket a jeleket, illetve hogy egyáltalán tudomásuk van-e ezek létezéséről. Előfordulhat, hogy nem vesszük figyelembe ezeket a jeleket. Letilthatja a nyomon követés bizonyos fajtáit (pl. a cookie-k letiltásával), és a célzott hirdetésekről is leiratkozhat, ha követi a [A cookie-k letiltása és az érdeklődésen alapuló hirdetésről való leiratkozás](#disablingcookies-hung) szakaszban olvasható utasításokat.

La presente Informativa sui cookie descrive come Honeywell International Inc. e le sue affiliate (collettivamente “**Honeywell**”, "**nostro**" o “**noi**”) utilizzano cookie e tecnologie assimilabili installati su dispositivi quali computer, dispositivi mobili o tablet (“**Dispositivi**”) dei visitatori o degli utenti del nostro sito web, dei nostri prodotti e/o applicazioni (“**Siti**”).

Cookie e tecnologie assimilabili possono elaborare informazioni personali. Vi invitiamo a prendere visione di quanto segue:

* la nostra [Informativa sulla privacy](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/privacy-statement#italian) se desidera ricevere maggiori informazioni su come trattiamo le informazioni personali dell'utente e su come esercitare i propri diritti in materia di dati personali
* il nostro [Centro preferenze sulla privacy](#) per maggiori informazioni sui cookie specifici che utilizziamo sui nostri siti e per gestire le preferenze relative ai cookie.

**Cosa sono i cookie?**

I cookie sono piccoli file di testo che i nostri siti inviano e registrano nei dispositivi degli utenti. Quando l'utente visita nuovamente i nostri siti, le nostre tecnologie si collegano automaticamente al cookie per identificare l'utente o il suo dispositivo e richiamare informazioni sull'utente, come la preferenza della lingua o le informazioni di accesso. Utilizziamo anche cookie di terze parti, che sono cookie di un dominio diverso da quello del sito web che l'utente sta visitando e che permettono a noi, alla terza parte proprietaria dei cookie e, in alcuni casi, ad altri partecipanti alle reti di cookie di identificare l'utente o il suo dispositivo mentre visita diversi siti web. Utilizziamo la parola "cookie" per includere un pezzo di testo, pixel, clear gif, file di log, web beacon o altre tecnologie di tracciamento simili che sono installate sui dispositivi dell'utente.

**Esistono quattro tipi di cookie che possiamo utilizzare:**

* **I cookie strettamente necessari** sono essenziali per il funzionamento dei nostri Siti e per fornire all'utente i servizi e le informazioni che ha richiesto. I cookie strettamente necessari non richiedono alcun consenso.
* **I cookie funzionali** permettono una maggiore funzionalità e personalizzazione. Per esempio, consentono ai nostri siti di ricordare le informazioni fornite dall'utente, come le preferenze di lingua e di memorizzare informazioni tecniche utili per l'interazione con i nostri siti. Possono essere impostati da noi o da fornitori terzi i cui servizi siano stati aggiunti ai nostri siti. Se non si accettano questi cookie, alcuni o tutti questi servizi potrebbero non funzionare correttamente.
* **I cookie di prestazione** acquisiscono informazioni sull'utilizzo dei nostri siti (per esempio, ci consentono di contare il numero di visitatori e le fonti di traffico) e ci aiutano a conoscere le prestazioni dei nostri siti in modo da poter apportare miglioramenti rilevanti che potrebbero ottimizzare l'esperienza di navigazione degli utenti (per esempio, ci consentono di sapere quali siano le pagine più e quali le meno apprezzate). Tutte le informazioni acquisite da questi cookie sono aggregate e quindi anonime.
* **I cookie pubblicitari/di profilazione** acquisiscono dati sull'attività online dell'utente e identificano i suoi interessi in modo da poter creare un profilo dell'utente e fornire una pubblicità più mirata. Svolgono anche funzioni come evitare che gli stessi annunci riappaiano continuamente, garantire la corretta visualizzazione degli annunci e selezionare gli annunci in base agli interessi dell'utente.

Per maggiori informazioni sui cookie utilizzati da Honeywell vi invitiamo a visitare il nostro [Centro preferenze sulla privacy](#).

**Perché utilizziamo i cookie e altre tecnologie assimilabili?**

Utilizziamo i cookie e altre tecnologie di tracciamento assimilabili per i seguenti scopi:

* memorizzare preferenze e impostazioni;
* consentire l'accesso e l'autenticazione dell'utente in modo che possa accedere ai nostri siti e passare da una pagina all'altra all'interno dei nostri siti;
* proteggere i nostri siti, in particolare per il rilevamento e la prevenzione delle frodi;
* personalizzare le informazioni fornite all'utente in base alle preferenze di navigazione, quali lingua e area geografica;
* monitorare i modelli di traffico degli utenti all'interno dei nostri siti ed acquisire statistiche sull'utilizzo del sito web per aiutarci a comprendere le prestazioni dei nostri siti e in che modo possiamo migliorarli per ottimizzare l'esperienza di navigazione e offrire servizi di maggiore rilevanza per l'utente;
* fornirci informazioni commerciali e di marketing;
* tracciare gli utenti che visitano, interagiscono con, o utilizzano uno dei nostri siti, le pagine di social media, gli annunci pubblicitari online e le comunicazioni di marketing (per esempio, quali annunci pubblicitari sono stati cliccati o se un utente ha aperto o inoltrato una e-mail che gli abbiamo inviato); e
* [pubblicità mirata](#targetedadvertising-italian); e
* [tracciamento cross-device e cross-site](#crossdevice-italian).

**Chi utilizza le informazioni memorizzate nei cookie e nelle tecnologie di tracciamento assimilabili?**

Le informazioni memorizzate nei cookie dei nostri siti sono utilizzate esclusivamente da noi (o da terze parti che agiscono per nostro conto), ad eccezione dei cookie di terze parti che sono utilizzati e gestiti da soggetti esterni per fornire i servizi da noi richiesti per ottimizzare i nostri servizi e l'esperienza degli utenti durante la navigazione nei nostri siti. Per maggiori informazioni sui cookie di prima parte e di terze parti utilizzati da Honeywell, si rimanda al nostro [Centro preferenze sulla privacy](#).

**E riguardo ai cookie di Flash chiamati anche oggetti locali condivisi??**

Possiamo utilizzare cookie di Flash o oggetti locali condivisi (“Flash LSO”) per memorizzare le preferenze dell'utente sul sito web, personalizzare la visita, prevenire le frodi e per altre operazioni del sito. Se non si desidera che i Flash LSO vengano memorizzati sul proprio computer, è possibile regolare le impostazioni del proprio Flash player per bloccare la memorizzazione dei Flash LSO utilizzando gli strumenti contenuti nel pannello delle impostazioni di memorizzazione del sito web. È inoltre possibile controllare i Flash LSO andando al pannello delle impostazioni di archiviazione globale e seguendo le istruzioni (che possono includere istruzioni che spiegano, per esempio, come cancellare i Flash LSO esistenti).

**Pubblicità mirata**

Tracciamo e analizziamo sia l'uso individuale che le informazioni statistiche aggregate relative all'utilizzo dei nostri siti. Collaboriamo inoltre con terze parti (come inserzionisti e partner pubblicitari) per presentare annunci pubblicitari sui nostri siti e per gestire e servire inserzioni pubblicitarie su altri siti di terze parti. Queste terze parti utilizzano cookie e tecnologie di tracciamento assimilabili per acquisire e utilizzare alcune informazioni sulle attività online degli utenti, sia sui nostri siti che su altri siti di terze parti, per misurare e monitorare l'efficacia della pubblicità e delle nostre attività di marketing online (per esempio, registrando dati sul numero di volte in cui si fa clic su una delle nostre pubblicità). Queste informazioni possono essere utilizzate da sole o in combinazione con le informazioni sull'utente che otteniamo da altre fonti (come i nostri partner di dati), i dati di contatto e la cronologia delle transazioni di Honeywell per identificare gli interessi degli utenti e fornire loro pubblicità e marketing mirati che siano più adatti a loro in base alle loro attività di navigazione e agli interessi individuati ("Pubblicità basata sugli interessi"). Tale pubblicità basata sugli interessi sarà fornita solo se consentito dalla legge applicabile e in conformità con le preferenze di pubblicità/marketing espresse dall'utente. Si segnala che i cookie e le tecnologie di altre terze parti sono disciplinati dalla politica sulla privacy specifica di ciascuna società e non dalla presente Informativa sui cookie.

**Tracciamento cross-device e cross-site**

Noi, i nostri fornitori di servizi e altre terze parti (come Google e altri partner pubblicitari) possiamo utilizzare le informazioni che acquisiamo sugli utenti (direttamente dai nostri siti o da una terza parte) allo scopo di riconoscerli online identificando i dispositivi che utilizzano. Utilizziamo queste informazioni per offrire [pubblicità mirata](#targetedadvertising-italian) su più dispositivi diversi ("corrispondenza cross-device") e siti ("tracciamento cross-site"). La corrispondenza cross-device ed il tracciamento cross-site ci consentono di comprendere meglio l'attività dei nostri clienti, migliorare la nostra capacità di indirizzare e misurare le campagne pubblicitarie (compresa la limitazione del numero di volte che un utente vede un annuncio). Ci consentono inoltre di abbinare i dispositivi in modo da poter favorire le scelte di disattivazione (opt-out) dell'utente su tutti i dispositivi che sappiamo essere collegati a un cookie disattivato.

**Disabilitazione dei cookie e disattivazione (opt-out) della pubblicità basata sugli interessi dell'utente**

È possibile operare opportune scelte sulla ricezione dei cookie utilizzando il nostro [Centro preferenze sulla privacy](#) o, in alternativa, le impostazioni del proprio browser dovrebbero consentire di eliminare e/o disattivare i cookie del sito web. Per maggiori informazioni su come eliminare i cookie nel proprio browser web, fare riferimento alle istruzioni del browser: [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en),  [Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies), [Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4468242/microsoft-edge-browsing-data-and-privacy), [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/clear-cookies-and-site-data-firefox), [Opera](https://help.opera.com/en/latest/web-preferences/#cookies), Safari ([Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac), [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265), [iPad](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265), or [iPod touch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265)).

Se si sceglie di disabilitare i cookie, è possibile che i siti non funzionino allo stesso modo. Alcuni cookie sono necessari per registrare e rispettare le scelte che sono state fatte per non essere contattati o per non aggiungere altri tipi di cookie al proprio dispositivo. Se si eliminano i cookie dal computer, anche il cookie utilizzato per riconoscere le preferenze dell'utente, compresa la pubblicità basata sugli interessi, sarà eliminato, richiedendo all'utente di effettuare nuovamente le proprie scelte.

Gli utenti possono anche decidere di disattivare le reti pubblicitarie di terze parti attraverso l'uso di vari siti web di associazioni commerciali, quali:

* Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) - [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/)
* Digital Advertising alliance (DAA) – (i) Global: [https://optout.aboutads.info/](https://optout.aboutads.info/); (ii) Europe: [http://youronlinechoices.eu/](http://youronlinechoices.eu/)

La disattivazione della pubblicità basata sugli interessi dell'utente implica la rinuncia alla fornitura da parte di queste aziende di contenuti o annunci basati sui propri interessi, ma non significa che non si riceverà più alcuna pubblicità attraverso il nostro sito web o altri siti web. È possibile continuare a vedere gli annunci di Honeywell, ma tali annunci non saranno personalizzati da Honeywell o dai nostri partner. Se in qualsiasi momento non si desidera che i propri dati personali vengano utilizzati per consentire a terzi di visualizzare annunci pubblicitari o per personalizzare gli annunci visualizzati, è possibile modificare le impostazioni utilizzando gli strumenti forniti da terzi, quali Google, Facebook e LinkedIn.

**Do Not Track (DNT)**

Alcuni browser Web possono trasmettere segnali “do-not-track” ai siti con cui l'utente comunica. A causa delle diverse modalità con cui i browser Web integrano e attivano tale funzionalità, non è sempre chiaro se gli utenti desiderano che tali segnali vengano trasmessi o se invece non sono neppure al corrente del loro invio. Potremmo non agire in risposta a questi segnali. L'utente può anche disabilitare il tracciamento (per esempio disabilitando i cookie) e può anche disattivare la pubblicità mirata seguendo le istruzioni riportate nella sezione “[Disabilitazione dei cookie e disattivazione (opt-out) della pubblicità basata sugli interessi dell'utente](#disablingcookies-italian)”.

**쿠키와 유사 추적 기술에 저장되어 있는 정보는 누가 사용하나요?**

당사 사이트의 쿠키에 저장되어 있는 정보는 전적으로 당사(또는 당사를 대신하는 제3자)가 사용합니다. 단, 당사 서비스와 당사 사이트를 이용하는 이용자들의 이용 경험을 향상시키기 위해 당사의 요청에 따라 서비스를 제공하기 위해 외부 당사자들이 사용 및 관리하는 서드 파티 쿠키의 경우는 예외로 합니다. Honeywell이 사용하는 퍼스트 파티 및 서드 파티 쿠키에 관한 자세한 사항은 당사의 [개인정보 보호 설정 센터(Privacy Preference Center)](#) 에서 확인하실 수 있습니다.

**플래시 쿠키나 로컬 공유 객체(LSO)는 어떤가요?**  
  
당사는 이용자의 웹사이트 설정을 저장하고, 이용자의 방문을 개인 맞춤화하고, 사기를 방지하는 목적, 그리고 그 외 사이트 운영 목적으로 플래시 쿠키 또는 로컬 공유 객체("플래시 LSO")를 사용할 수 있습니다. 이용자가 컴퓨터에 저장되어 있는 플래시 LSO 사용을 원치 않는 경우, 웹사이트 저장 설정 패널(Website Storage Settings Panel)에 있는 도구를 사용해 플래시 LSO 저장을 차단하도록 플래시 플레이어 설정을 변경하면 됩니다. 또한, 전체 저장 설정 패널(Global Storage Settings Panel)로 가서 안내에 따라 플래시 LSO 설정을 변경할 수도 있습니다(안내에는 예를 들어 기존 플래시 LSO를 삭제하는 방법도 포함될 수 있습니다).

**표적 광고**

당사는 이용자의 당사 사이트 이용과 관련한 개인별 이용 정보와 취합된 통계 정보를 모두 추적하고 분석합니다. 또한 당사는 당사 사이트에 광고를 게재하고 다른 제3자 사이트에서 광고를 관리 및 게재하기 위해 제3자(광고주 및 광고 파트너 등)와 파트너 관계를 맺기도 합니다. 이러한 제3자는 광고의 효과성과 당사의 온라인 마케팅 활동을 측정 및 추적하기 위해 당사 사이트에서나 다른 제3자 사이트들에서 이용자의 온라인 활동에 관한 특정 정보를 수집 및 사용하기 위해 쿠키 및 유사 추적 기술을 사용합니다(예를 들어, 이용자가 당사 광고 중 하나를 클릭한 횟수에 관한 데이터를 수집). 이러한 정보는 이용자의 관심사를 추론하고 이용자의 브라우징 활동 및 추론한 관심사를 바탕으로 이용자에게 더 맞게 만들어진 표적 광고 및 마케팅("관심 기반 광고")을 전달하기 위해 단독으로, 또는 당사가 다른 출처(예: 당사 데이터 파트너)에서 이용자에 관해 수집하는 정보, 이용자의 연락처 정보 및 Honeywell 거래 이력 등과 결합해 사용될 수 있습니다. 이러한 관심 기반 광고는 관련 법률에서 허용하는 경우에 한해, 이용자의 광고/마케팅 선호 사항에 따라 제공됩니다. 다른 제3자의 쿠키 및 기술에는 본 쿠키 고지가 아니라 각 기업별 개인정보 보호 정책이 적용된다는 사실에 유의하시기 바랍니다.

**크로스 디바이스 및 크로스 사이트 추적**

당사, 당사의 서비스 제공자 및 기타 제3자(예: Google 및 기타 광고 파트너)는 이용자가 사용하는 디바이스를 식별해 온라인 상에서 이용자를 인지하기 위한 목적으로 당사가 이용자에 관해 (당사 사이트에서 직접 또는 제3자로부터) 수집한 정보를 사용할 수 있습니다. 당사는 여러 다른 디바이스("크로스 디바이스 매칭") 및 사이트("크로스 사이트 추적")에 걸쳐 이용자에게 [표적 광고](#targetedadvertisingkorean)를 제공하는 데 이 정보를 사용합니다. 당사는 크로스 디바이스 매칭과 크로스 사이트 추적을 통해 당사 고객들의 활동을 보다 잘 이해하고, 광고 캠페인의 표적을 정하고 측정하는 능력을 향상시킬 수 있습니다(이용자가 특정 광고를 보게 되는 횟수를 제한하는 것 포함). 또한, 당사는 이를 통해 디바이스를 매칭함으로써 당사가 옵트아웃된 쿠키에 연결되어 있다는 것을 아는 모든 디바이스에 걸쳐 이용자의 옵트아웃 선택을 적용할 수 있습니다.

**쿠키 비활성화 및 관심 기반 광고 선택 해제(옵트아웃)**

이용자는 [당사의 개인정보 보호 설정 센터(Privacy Preference Center)](#)를 이용해 쿠키 수신 관련 설정을 선택하거나, 브라우저 설정을 이용해 웹사이트 쿠키를 삭제 및/또는 비활성화할 수 있습니다. 웹 브라우저에서 쿠키를 삭제하는 방법에 관한 자세한 설명은 해당 브라우저의 지침을 참고하시기 바랍니다. [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en),  [Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies), [Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4468242/microsoft-edge-browsing-data-and-privacy), [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/clear-cookies-and-site-data-firefox), [Opera,](https://help.opera.com/en/latest/web-preferences/#cookies) Safari ([Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac), [iPhone, iPad, 또는 iPod touch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265)).

이용자가 쿠키를 비활성화하는 경우 사이트에서 작동하지 않는 부분이 생길 수 있습니다. 쿠키들 중에는 연락을 받지 않겠다거나 다른 유형의 쿠키가 내 디바이스에 추가되지 않도록 하는 것과 관련해 이용자가 하는 선택을 기록하고 존중하는 데 필요한 쿠키들이 있습니다. 이용자가 컴퓨터에서 쿠키를 삭제하는 경우, 관심 기반 광고를 포함해 이용자의 설정 선택을 인식하는 데 사용되는 쿠키도 삭제되기 때문에 이용자는 다시 선택을 해야 합니다.

또한 이용자는 다음과 같은 다양한 업계 협회 웹사이트 이용을 통해 제3자 광고 네트워크에서 선택 해제(옵트아웃)할 수도 있습니다.

* NAI(Network Advertising Initiative) - [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/)
* DAA(Digital Advertising Alliance) – (i) 글로벌: [https://optout.aboutads.info/](https://optout.aboutads.info/), (ii) 유럽: [http://youronlinechoices.eu/](http://youronlinechoices.eu/)

관심 기반 광고에서 옵트아웃하면 해당 기업들의 관심 기반 콘텐츠나 광고를 받지 않게 되지만, 그렇다고 해서 당사 웹사이트나 다른 웹사이트를 통해 광고를 전혀 받지 않게 되는 것은 아닙니다. Honeywell 광고가 계속 표시될 수는 있지만 그 광고는 Honeywell이나 당사 파트너가 그 이용자에 맞춤 게재하는 광고는 아닙니다. 어느 시점에든 이용자가 제3자가 광고를 게재하거나 자신에게 표시되는 광고를 개인 맞춤화하는 데 자신의 개인 정보를 이용하는 것을 원치 않는 경우 이용자는 Google, Facebook, LinkedIn 등 제3자가 제공하는 도구를 이용해 설정을 변경할 수도 있습니다.

**DNT(Do Not Track, 추적 금지)**

일부 웹 브라우저는 이용자가 방문하는 사이트에 “추적 금지” 신호를 전송할 수 있습니다. 웹 브라우저가 이 기능을 통합하고 실행하는 방식에 차이가 있기 때문에 이용자가 이러한 신호를 전송하도록 의도한 것인지 여부 또는 이용자가 이를 알고 있는지 여부가 명확하지 않을 수 있습니다. 당사는 이러한 신호에 반응하지 않을 수 있습니다. 또한 이용자는 특정 추적 기능을 비활성화(예: 쿠키를 비활성화하는 방법으로)할 수 있으며, [“쿠키 비활성화및 관심 기반 광고 선택 해제(옵트아웃)"](#disablingcookieskorean) 섹션에 나와 있는 설명에 따라 표적 광고를 옵트아웃할 수 있습니다.

**Gerichte reclame**

We traceren en analyseren zowel geïndividualiseerd gebruik als samengevoegde statistische informatie met betrekking tot uw gebruik van onze sites. We werken ook samen met derden (zoals adverteerders en advertentiepartners) om advertenties op onze sites weer te geven en om advertenties op andere sites van derden te beheren en weer te geven. Deze derde partijen gebruiken cookies en vergelijkbare traceringstechnologieën om bepaalde informatie over uw online activiteiten te verzamelen en te gebruiken, hetzij op onze sites, hetzij op andere sites van derden om de effectiviteit van advertenties en onze online marketingactiviteiten te meten en te traceren (bijvoorbeeld door gegevens te verzamelen over hoe vaak u op een van onze advertenties klikt). Deze informatie kan afzonderlijk worden gebruikt of in combinatie met informatie over u, die we verkrijgen uit andere bronnen (zoals onze gegevenspartners), uw contactgegevens en transactiegeschiedenis bij Honeywell om uw interesses af te leiden en u gerichte reclame en marketing te leveren die meer zijn afgestemd op u, op basis van uw browse-activiteiten en afgeleide interesses ("Op interesses gebaseerde reclame"). Dergelijke op interesses gebaseerde reclame wordt alleen geleverd indien toegestaan door de toepasselijke wetgeving en in overeenstemming met uw reclame-/marketingvoorkeuren. Merk op dat de cookies en technologieën van andere derde partijen zijn onderworpen aan het specifieke privacybeleid van elk bedrijf en niet door deze kennisgeving over cookies.

**Volgen over apparaten en sites**

Wij, onze dienstverleners en andere derde partijen (zoals Google en andere advertentiepartners) kunnen informatie die we over u verzamelen (rechtstreeks van onze sites of van een derde partij) gebruiken om u online te herkennen door het identificeren van de door u gebruikte apparaten. We gebruiken deze informatie om u [gerichte reclame](#targetedadvertising-netherlands) aan te bieden op meerdere verschillende apparaten ("cross-device matching") en sites ("cross-site tracking"). Cross-device matching en cross-site tracking stelt ons in staat om de activiteiten van onze klanten beter te begrijpen, ons vermogen te verbeteren om reclamecampagnes te richten en te meten (inclusief het beperken van het aantal keren dat een gebruiker een advertentie ziet). Het helpt ons ook apparaten te koppelen, zodat we uw keuzes voor uitschrijven kunnen vergemakkelijken over alle apparaten waarvan we weten dat ze zijn verbonden met een uitschrijfcookie.

**Cookies uitschakelen en uitschrijven voor op interesses gebaseerde reclame**

U kunt keuzes maken over het ontvangen van cookies door gebruik te maken van ons [Centrum voor privacyvoorkeuren](#) of u kunt websitecookies verwijderen en/of uitschakelen in uw browserinstellingen. Raadpleeg de instructies van uw browser voor meer informatie over het verwijderen van cookies in uw webbrowser: [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en),  [Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies), [Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4468242/microsoft-edge-browsing-data-and-privacy), [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/clear-cookies-and-site-data-firefox), [Opera](https://help.opera.com/en/latest/web-preferences/#cookies), Safari ([Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac), [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265), [iPad](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265), or [iPod touch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265)).

Sommige cookies zijn nodig om de keuzes die u hebt gemaakt vast te leggen en te respecteren met betrekking tot het feit dat er geen contact met u wordt opgenomen of dat er geen andere soorten cookies aan uw apparaat worden toegevoegd. Als u cookies verwijdert van uw computer, dan wordt de cookie die wordt gebruikt om uw voorkeuren te herkennen, inclusief op interesses gebaseerde reclame, ook verwijderd en moet u uw keuzes opnieuw maken.

Gebruikers kunnen zich ook afmelden voor advertentienetwerken van derden door het gebruik van verschillende websites van handelsverenigingen, zoals:

* Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) - [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/)

Als u zich uitschrijft voor op interesses gebaseerde reclame, dan wordt u uitgeschreven van het door deze bedrijven leveren van op interesses gebaseerde inhoud of advertenties, maar dit betekent niet dat u geen reclame meer ontvangt via onze website of andere websites. U ziet mogelijk nog steeds Honeywell-advertenties, maar deze advertenties worden niet aangepast aan u door Honeywell of onze partners. Als u op enig moment niet wilt dat uw persoonsgegevens worden gebruikt om derden toe te staan reclame weer te geven of om aan u getoonde reclame te personaliseren, dan kunt u uw instellingen ook aanpassen met behulp van de hulpmiddelen van dergelijk derden. Google, Facebook en LinkedIn.

**Niet volgen (Do Not Track - DNT)**

Sommige webbrowsers verzenden signalen voor "niet volgen" naar sites waarmee u communiceert. Vanwege verschillen in hoe webbrowsers deze functie verwerken en activeren, is het niet altijd duidelijk of gebruikers willen dat deze signalen worden verzonden of dat ze zich zelfs ook maar bewust zijn van deze signalen. We handelen mogelijk niet in reactie op deze signalen. U kunt ook bepaalde tracering uitschakelen (bijvoorbeeld door cookies uit te schakelen) en u kunt zich ook afmelden voor gerichte reclame door het volgen van de instructies in de paragraaf [cookies uitschakelen en afmelden voor op interesses gebaseerde reclame](#disablingcookies-netherlands).

**Oppdatert: 11. juni 2021**

Denne merknaden om informasjonskapsler beskriver hvordan Honeywell International Inc. og dets tilknyttede selskaper (samlet **"Honeywell"**, **"oss"** eller **"vi"**) bruker informasjonskapsler og lignende teknologi installert på enheter som en datamaskin, mobilenhet eller nettbrett (**"enheter"**) av besøkende til eller brukere av nettstedet vårt og våre produkter og/eller applikasjoner (**"nettsteder"**).

Informasjonskapsler og lignende teknologier kan behandle personopplysninger. Besøk gjerne:

* [personvernerklæringen](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/privacy-statement#norwegian) hvis du vil ha mer informasjon om hvordan vi behandler personopplysningene dine, og hvordan du kan utøve dine rettigheter som registrert
* [Senter for personverninnstillinger](#) for mer informasjon om de spesifikke informasjonskapslene vi bruker på våre nettsteder, og for å administrere innstillingene dine for informasjonskapsler.

**Hva er informasjonskapsler?**

Informasjonskapsler er små tekstfiler som nettstedene våre plasserer på enhetene dine. Når du besøker nettstedene våre på nytt, kobles teknologiene våre automatisk til informasjonskapselen for å identifisere deg eller enheten din og huske informasjon om deg, for eksempel språkinnstillinger eller påloggingsinformasjon. Vi bruker også tredjeparts informasjonskapsler, som er informasjonskapsler fra et annet domene enn domenet til nettstedet du besøker, og som tillater oss, tredjeparten som eier informasjonskapslene og i noen tilfeller andre deltakere i informasjonskapselnettverk å identifisere deg eller enheten din når du besøker ulike nettsteder. Med «informasjonskapsler» mener vi tekst, piksler, klare gif-filer, loggfiler, nettsignaler eller annen lignende sporingsteknologi som plasseres på enhetene dine.

**Det er fire typer informasjonskapsler vi kan bruke:**

* **Strengt nødvendige informasjonskapsler** er nødvendige for at nettstedene våre skal fungere og for å gi deg tjenestene og informasjonen du har bedt om. Strengt nødvendige informasjonskapsler er unntatt kravet om samtykke.
* **Funksjonelle informasjonskapsler** muliggjør forbedret funksjonalitet og personlig tilpasning. De gjør det mulig for nettstedene våre å huske opplysninger som du oppgir, for eksempel språkinnstillinger, samt lagre tekniske opplysninger som er nyttige for samhandlingen din med nettstedene våre. De kan plasseres av oss eller av tredjepartsleverandører som vi har lagt til tjenester fra på nettstedene våre. Hvis du ikke tillater disse informasjonskapslene, kan det hende at noen eller alle disse tjenestene ikke fungerer som de skal.
* **Ytelsesinformasjonskapsler** samler inn informasjon om din bruk av nettstedene våre (for eksempel lar de oss telle besøk og trafikkilder) og hjelper oss med å lære hvordan nettstedene våre fungerer, slik at vi kan gjøre relevante forbedringer som kan forbedre nettleseropplevelsen din (for eksempel kan vi finne ut hvilke sider som er mest og minst populære). All informasjon som disse informasjonskapslene samler inn, er anonym.
* **Reklame-/målrettingsinformasjonskapsler** samler inn data om aktiviteten din på nett og identifiserer interessene dine slik at vi kan opprette en profil for deg og vise reklame som er mer relevant for deg. De utfører også funksjoner som å forhindre at de samme annonsene vises igjen kontinuerlig, sørge for at annonsene vises riktig, og velge annonser som er basert på dine interesser.

Hvis du vil ha mer informasjon om informasjonskapslene som Honeywell bruker, kan du besøke [Senter for personverninnstillinger](#).

**Hvorfor bruker vi informasjonskapsler og annen lignende teknologi?**

Vi bruker informasjonskapsler og annen lignende sporingsteknologi for følgende formål:

* Lagre dine preferanser og innstillinger;
* Tillate deg å logge på og autentisere deg slik at du får tilgang til nettstedene våre og kan flytte fra side til side innenfor nettstedene våre;
* Sikre nettstedene våre, inkludert oppdagelse og forebygging av svindel;
* Skreddersy informasjonen som presenteres for deg basert på nettlesingsinnstillingene dine, for eksempel språk og geografisk region;
* Overvåke trafikkmønstrene til brukerne på nettstedene våre og samle statistikk om bruken din av nettstedet for å hjelpe oss med å forstå hvordan nettstedene våre fungerer, og hvordan vi kan forbedre nettstedene våre for formål som å forbedre nettleseropplevelsen og tilby tjenester som er mer relevante for deg;
* Gi oss forretnings- og markedsføringsinformasjon;
* Spore brukere som besøker, samhandler med eller bruker noen av våre nettsteder, sosiale mediesider, nettannonser og markedsføringskommunikasjon (for eksempel hvilke annonser som er klikket på, eller hvis en bruker har åpnet eller videresendt en e-post vi har sendt dem); og
* [Målrettet reklame](#targetedadvertising-norwegian); og
* [Sporing på tvers av enheter og på tvers av nettsteder](#crossdevice-norwegian).

**Hvem bruker informasjonen som er lagret i informasjonskapsler og lignende sporingsteknologi?**

Informasjonen som lagres i våre nettsteders informasjonskapsler, brukes utelukkende av oss (eller av tredjeparter som opptrer på våre vegne), med unntak av tredjeparts informasjonskapsler som brukes og administreres av eksterne parter for å tilby tjenester som vi har bedt om for å forbedre tjenestene våre og opplevelsen din når du navigerer på nettstedene våre. Hvis du vil ha mer informasjon om førsteparts- og tredjeparts informasjonskapsler som Honeywell bruker, kan du besøke [Senter for personverninnstillinger](#).

**Hva med Flash-informasjonskapsler eller lokale delte objekter?**

Vi kan bruke Flash-informasjonskapsler eller lokale delte objekter for å lagre nettstedsinnstillingene dine, tilpasse besøket ditt, forhindre svindel og for andre nettstedsoperasjoner. Hvis du ikke vil ha Flash-informasjonskapsler lagret på datamaskinen din, kan du endre innstillingene til Flash-spilleren slik at Flash-informasjonskapsler blokkeres ved hjelp av verktøyet i Innstillingspanel for lagring av nettsteder. Du kan også kontrollere Flash-informasjonskapsler ved å gå til Globalt innstillingspanel for lagring og følge instruksjonene (som kan inneholde instruksjoner som for eksempel forklarer hvordan du sletter eksisterende Flash-informasjonskapsler).

**Målrettet reklame**

Vi sporer og analyserer både individuell bruk og samlet statistisk informasjon relatert til din bruk av våre nettsteder. Vi samarbeider også med tredjeparter (for eksempel annonsører og annonsepartnere) for å vise reklame på nettstedene våre og for å administrere og vise reklame på andre tredjeparts nettsteder. Disse tredjepartene bruker informasjonskapsler og lignende sporingsteknologier for å samle inn og bruke bestemt informasjon om dine aktiviteter på nettet, enten på nettstedene våre eller andre tredjepartsnettsteder for å måle og spore effektiviteten til reklame og våre markedsføringsaktiviteter på nett (f.eks. ved å samle inn data om hvor mange ganger du klikker på en av annonsene våre). Denne informasjonen kan brukes alene eller i kombinasjon med informasjon om deg som vi får fra andre kilder (som våre datapartnere), dine kontaktopplysninger og Honeywell-transaksjonshistorikk for å utlede dine interesser og levere målrettede annonser og markedsføring som er mer skreddersydd for deg basert på dine nettleseraktiviteter og utledede interesser («interessebasert reklame»). Slik interessebasert reklame vil bare bli levert der det er tillatt i henhold til gjeldende lov og i samsvar med dine reklame-/markedsføringspreferanser. Vær oppmerksom på at informasjonskapsler og teknologier fra andre tredjeparter er underlagt det aktuelle selskapets spesifikke personvernregler og ikke denne merknaden om informasjonskapsler.

**Sporing på tvers av enheter og på tvers av nettsteder**

Vi, tjenesteleverandørene våre og andre tredjeparter (som Google og andre annonsepartnere) kan bruke informasjon vi samler inn om deg (enten direkte fra nettstedene våre eller fra en tredjepart) for å gjenkjenne deg på nett ved å identifisere enhetene du bruker. Vi bruker denne informasjonen til å gi deg [målrettet reklame](#targetedadvertising-norwegian) på tvers av flere ulike enheter ("samsvar mellom enheter") og nettsteder ("sporing på tvers av nettsteder"). Samsvar på tvers av enheter og sporing på tvers av nettsteder lar oss bedre forstå kundens aktivitet og dermed forbedre vår evne til å målrette og måle annonsekampanjer (inkludert begrensning av antall ganger en bruker ser en annonse). Det hjelper oss også å avstemme enheter slik at vi kan gjøre det enklere for deg å velge bort alle enhetene vi vet er koblet til en valgt informasjonskapsel.

**Deaktivere informasjonskapsler og velge bort interessebasert reklame**

Du kan ta valg om å motta informasjonskapsler ved å bruke vårt [Senter for personverninnstillinger](#), eller alternativt bør nettleserinnstillingene tillate deg å slette og/eller deaktivere informasjonskapsler på nettstedet. For mer informasjon om hvordan du sletter informasjonskapslene dine i nettleseren din, kan du se nettleserens instruksjoner: [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en), [Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies), [Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4468242/microsoft-edge-browsing-data-and-privacy), [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/clear-cookies-and-site-data-firefox), [Opera](https://help.opera.com/en/latest/web-preferences/#cookies), Safari ([Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac), [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265), [iPad eller iPod touch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265)).

Hvis du velger å deaktivere informasjonskapsler, kan det hende at nettsteder kanskje ikke fungerer på samme måte. Noen informasjonskapsler er nødvendige for å registrere og respektere valgene du har gjort med hensyn til ikke å bli kontaktet eller for at andre typer informasjonskapsler ikke skal legges til på enheten din. Hvis du sletter informasjonskapsler fra datamaskinen din, vil informasjonskapselen som brukes til å gjenkjenne preferansene dine, inkludert interessebasert reklame, også bli slettet, og du må angi valgene dine på nytt.

Brukere kan også velge bort tredjeparts annonsenettverk ved bruk av ulike nettsteder som tilhører bransjesammenslutninger, som:

* Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) - [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/)
* Digital Advertising alliance (DAA) – (i) Global: [https://optout.aboutads.info/](https://optout.aboutads.info/); (ii) Europa: [http://youronlinechoices.eu/](http://youronlinechoices.eu/)

Hvis du velger bort interessebasert reklame, velger du bort disse selskapenes levering av interessebasert innhold eller annonser til deg, men betyr ikke at du ikke lenger vil motta noen reklame via nettstedet vårt eller andre nettsteder. Du kan fremdeles se Honeywell-annonser, men disse annonsene blir ikke tilpasset til deg av Honeywell eller våre partnere. Hvis du på et eller annet tidspunkt ikke vil at personopplysningene dine skal brukes til å tillate tredjeparter å vise annonser eller til å tilpasse annonser som vises for deg, kan du også justere innstillingene dine ved å bruke verktøyene som tilbys av tredjeparter, som f.eks. Google, Facebook og LinkedIn.

**Ikke spor (DNT)**

Enkelte nettlesere kan sende "ikke-spor"-signaler til nettstedene som brukeren kommuniserer med. På grunn av forskjeller i hvordan nettlesere innlemmer og aktiverer denne funksjonen, er det ikke alltid klart om brukerne har til hensikt å overføre disse signalene, eller om de selv er klar over dem. Vi handler kanskje ikke som svar på disse signalene. Du kan også deaktivere bestemt sporing (f.eks. ved å deaktivere informasjonskapsler), og du kan også velge bort målrettet reklame ved å følge instruksjonene i avsnittet "[Deaktivere informasjonskapsler og velge bort interessebasert reklame](#disablingcookies-norwegian)".

**Data aktualizacji: 11 czerwca 2021 r.**  

W tych Informacjach o plikach cookie opisano, w jaki sposób firma Honeywell International Inc. i jej podmioty stowarzyszone (łącznie **"Honeywell”** lub **"my”**) wykorzystuje pliki cookie i podobne technologie zainstalowane na urządzeniach takich jak komputery, urządzenia mobilne lub tablety (**"Urządzenia”**) osób odwiedzających naszą witrynę internetową lub użytkowników tej witryny, naszych produktów i/lub aplikacji (**"Witryny”**).

Pliki cookie i podobne technologie mogą przetwarzać dane osobowe. Prosimy przejść do:

* naszego [Oświadczenia o ochronie prywatności](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/privacy-statement#polish), jeśli użytkownik chce dowiedzieć się więcej o tym, w jaki sposób przetwarzamy jego dane osobowe i jak egzekwować swoje prawa osoby, której dane dotyczą
* naszego [Centrum preferencji dotyczących prywatności](#), aby uzyskać więcej informacji o określonych plikach cookie używanych w naszych Witrynach i zarządzać preferencjami dotyczącymi tych plików.

**Co to są pliki cookie?**

Pliki cookie to małe pliki tekstowe umieszczane przez nasze Witryny na Urządzeniach użytkowników. Po ponownym odwiedzeniu Witryn nasze technologie automatycznie łączą się z plikiem cookie w celu identyfikacji użytkownika lub jego Urządzenia i przywołania informacji o użytkowniku takich jak preferencje językowe lub dane logowania. Używamy również plików cookie innych firm, które są plikami cookie z domeny innej niż domena odwiedzanej przez użytkownika strony internetowej i pozwalają nam, osobie trzeciej będącej właścicielem plików cookie, a w niektórych przypadkach innym uczestnikom sieci plików cookie, zidentyfikować użytkownika lub jego Urządzenie podczas odwiedzania różnych stron internetowych. Używamy słowa „pliki cookie”, aby dołączyć fragment tekstu, piksele, czyste pliki GIF, pliki dziennika, obrazy web beacon lub inną podobną technologię śledzenia, które są umieszczane na Urządzeniach użytkownika.

**Są cztery rodzaje plików cookie, których możemy używać:**

* **Niezbędne pliki cookie** są potrzebne do działania naszych Witryn i dostarczania użytkownikowi usług i informacji, o które prosił. Niezbędne pliki cookie są zwolnione z wymogu udzielania zgody.
* **Funkcjonalne pliki cookie** umożliwiają zwiększenie funkcjonalności i personalizacji. Przykładowo te pliki pozwalają naszym Witrynom zapamiętywać informacje udostępniane przez użytkownika takie jak preferencje językowe oraz gromadzić informacje techniczne przydatne w interakcjach użytkownika z Witrynami. Mogą one być ustawiane przez nas lub przez dostawców zewnętrznych, których usługi dodaliśmy do Witryn. Jeśli użytkownik nie wyrazi zgody na te pliki cookie, niektóre lub wszystkie z tych usług mogą nie działać poprawnie.
* **Pliki cookie związane z wydajnością** gromadzą informacje na temat korzystania z Witryn (np. pozwalają nam liczyć wizyty i źródła ruchu) i pomagają nam dowiedzieć się, w jaki sposób działają Witryny, abyśmy mogli wprowadzić odpowiednie ulepszenia, które mogłyby usprawnić ich przeglądanie (na przykład dzięki nim wiemy, które strony są najbardziej i najmniej popularne). Wszystkie informacje gromadzone przez te pliki cookie są agregowane, a zatem anonimowe.
* **Pliki cookie do obsługi reklam/targetowania** gromadzą dane na temat działań użytkownika online i identyfikują jego zainteresowania, abyśmy mogli stworzyć jego profil i dostarczyć reklamę, która jest do niego lepiej dopasowana. Pełnią również takie funkcje, jak zapobieganie ciągłemu pojawianiu się tych samych reklam, dbanie o prawidłowe wyświetlanie reklam oraz wybieranie reklam opartych na zainteresowaniach użytkownika.

Więcej informacji na temat plików cookie, z których korzysta firma Honeywell, można znaleźć w [Centrum preferencji dotyczących prywatności](#).

**Dlaczego korzystamy z plików cookie i innych podobnych technologii?**

Korzystamy z plików cookie i innych podobnych technologii śledzenia w następujących celach:

* przechowywanie preferencji i ustawień użytkownika;
* zezwalanie na logowanie i uwierzytelnianie użytkownika, aby mógł uzyskać dostęp do Witryn i przechodzić w nich pomiędzy stronami;
* zabezpieczanie naszych Witryn, w tym wykrywanie oszustw i zapobieganie im;
* dostosowywanie przedstawianych użytkownikowi informacji na podstawie jego preferencji w zakresie przeglądania takich jak język i obszar geograficzny;
* monitorowanie wzorców ruchu użytkowników w naszych Witrynach oraz zbieranie statystyk dotyczących korzystania z witryn internetowych przez użytkownika, abyśmy mogli zrozumieć sposób działania naszych Witryn i je ulepszać w celu usprawnienia procesu przeglądania i oferowania usług lepiej dopasowanych do potrzeb użytkownika;
* dostarczanie nam informacji biznesowych i marketingowych;
* śledzenie użytkowników, którzy korzystają z Witryn, stron mediów społecznościowych, reklam online i materiałów marketingowych lub je wyświetlają (np. które reklamy kliknięto i gdzie lub czy użytkownik otworzył lub przekazał wysłaną przez nas wiadomość e-mail);
* [reklama ukierunkowana](#targetedadvertising-polish);
* [śledzenie na różnych urządzeniach i w różnych witrynach](#crossdevice-polish).

**Kto korzysta z informacji zapisanych w plikach cookie i podobnych technologiach śledzenia?**

Informacje przechowywane w plikach cookie Witryn są wykorzystywane wyłącznie przez nas (lub osoby trzecie działające w naszym imieniu) z wyjątkiem plików cookie osób trzecich, które są używane i zarządzane przez strony zewnętrzne do świadczenia usług wymaganych przez nas w celu udoskonalenia naszych usług i obsługi użytkownika podczas nawigacji w Witrynach. Więcej informacji na temat plików cookie tej samej firmy i innych firm używanych przez firmę Honeywell można znaleźć w naszym [Centrum preferencji dotyczących prywatności](#).

**Co z plikami cookie Flash lub lokalnymi obiektami udostępnionymi?**

Możemy używać plików cookie Flash lub lokalnych obiektów udostępnionych („LOU Flash”) do przechowywania preferencji użytkownika dotyczących witryny internetowej, personalizacji jego wizyt, zapobiegania oszustwom i innych operacji w ramach witryny. Jeśli użytkownik nie chce, aby obiekty LOU Flash były przechowywane na jego komputerze, może dostosować ustawienia odtwarzacza Flash, aby zablokować pamięć LOU Flash za pomocą narzędzi z panelu ustawień przechowywania witryn internetowych. Może również sterować obiektami LOU Flash, przechodząc do Panelu globalnych ustawień przechowywania i postępując zgodnie z instrukcjami (które mogą na przykład obejmować instrukcje wyjaśniające, jak usunąć istniejące obiekty LOU Flash).

**Reklama ukierunkowana**

Śledzimy i analizujemy zarówno przypadki indywidualnego korzystania z Witryn, jak i zagregowane informacje statystyczne na ten temat. Współpracujemy również z osobami trzecimi (takimi jak reklamodawcy i partnerzy reklamowi) w celu wyświetlania reklam w Witrynach oraz zarządzania reklamami i wyświetlania ich w innych witrynach osób trzecich. Te osoby trzecie wykorzystują pliki cookie i podobne technologie śledzenia w celu gromadzenia i wykorzystywania niektórych informacji o działaniach online użytkownika, zarówno w naszych Witrynach, jak i innych witrynach osób trzecich, w celu pomiaru i monitorowania skuteczności reklam i naszych działań marketingowych online (na przykład poprzez zbieranie danych o tym, ile razy użytkownik klika jedną z naszych reklam). Informacje te mogą być wykorzystywane odrębnie lub w połączeniu z informacjami o użytkowniku, które uzyskujemy z innych źródeł (takich jak nasi partnerzy w zakresie danych), danymi kontaktowymi użytkownika i historią transakcji w firmie Honeywell, aby wyciągnąć wnioski dotyczące zainteresowań użytkownika i dostarczyć mu ukierunkowane reklamy i marketing, które są bardziej dostosowane do użytkownika na podstawie jego działań związanych z przeglądaniem i wywnioskowanych zainteresowań („Reklama oparta na zainteresowaniach”). Taka Reklama oparta na zainteresowaniach będzie dostarczana tylko wtedy, gdy jest to dozwolone przez obowiązujące prawo i zgodne z preferencjami reklamowymi/marketingowymi użytkownika. Należy pamiętać, że pliki cookie i technologie innych osób trzecich podlegają określonym zasadom dotyczącym ochrony prywatności każdej firmy, a nie tym Informacjom o plikach cookie.

**Śledzenie na różnych urządzeniach i w różnych witrynach.**

My, nasi dostawcy usług i inne osoby trzecie (takie jak Google i inni partnerzy reklamowi) możemy wykorzystywać informacje, które gromadzimy na temat użytkownika (bezpośrednio z Witryn lub od osób trzecich) w celu rozpoznawania użytkownika online poprzez identyfikację Urządzeń, z których korzysta. Używamy tych informacji do wyświetlania [ukierunkowanych reklam](#targetedadvertising-polish) na wielu różnych Urządzeniach („dopasowywanie na różnych urządzeniach”) i w witrynach („śledzenie w różnych witrynach”). Dopasowywanie na różnych urządzeniach i śledzenie w różnych witrynach pozwalają nam lepiej zrozumieć aktywność naszych klientów, poprawić możliwości kierowania kampaniami reklamowych i ich pomiaru (w tym ograniczyć liczbę wyświetleń danej reklamy przez użytkownika). Pomaga to nam również dopasować Urządzenia, dzięki czemu możemy ułatwić rezygnację z wyrażenia zgody przez użytkownika na wszystkich Urządzeniach, o których wiemy, że są połączone z plikiem cookie, z którego użytkownik zrezygnował.

**Wyłączanie plików cookie i rezygnacja z reklam opartych na zainteresowaniach**

Użytkownik może dokonywać wyborów dotyczących otrzymywania plików cookie za pomocą naszego [Centrum preferencji dotyczących prywatności](#). Usunięcie i/lub wyłączenie plików cookie witryny internetowej powinno być również możliwe za pomocą ustawień przeglądarki. Więcej informacji na temat usuwania plików cookie w przeglądarce internetowej można znaleźć w instrukcjach przeglądarek: [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en),  [Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies), [Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4468242/microsoft-edge-browsing-data-and-privacy), [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/clear-cookies-and-site-data-firefox), [Opera](https://help.opera.com/en/latest/web-preferences/#cookies), Safari ([Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac), [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265), [iPad](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265), or [iPod touch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265)).

Jeśli użytkownik zdecyduje się wyłączyć pliki cookie, Witryny mogą nie działać w ten sam sposób. Niektóre pliki cookie są niezbędne do rejestrowania i zapamiętują wybory użytkownika w odniesieniu do rezygnacji z kontaktu lub dodawania innych rodzajów plików cookie do Urządzenia użytkownika. Jeśli użytkownik usunie pliki cookie z komputera, plik cookie używany do rozpoznawania jego preferencji, w tym Reklamy opartej na zainteresowaniach, również zostanie usunięty, co wymaga ponownego dokonania wyboru.

Użytkownicy mogą również zrezygnować z korzystania z zewnętrznych sieci reklamowych za pośrednictwem witryn internetowych różnych stowarzyszeń branżowych, takich jak:

* Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) — [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/)
* Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) — (i) cały świat: [https://optout.aboutads.info/](https://optout.aboutads.info/); (ii) Europa: [http://youronlinechoices.eu/](http://youronlinechoices.eu/)

Rezygnacja z Reklamy opartej na zainteresowaniach spowoduje rezygnację z dostarczania przez te firmy treści lub reklam opartych na zainteresowaniach, ale nie oznacza to, że użytkownik nie będzie już otrzymywać żadnych reklam za pośrednictwem naszej witryny internetowej lub innych witryn internetowych. Użytkownik może nadal widzieć reklamy Honeywell, ale nie będą one dostosowywane do jego potrzeb przez firmę Honeywell lub naszych partnerów. Jeśli w dowolnym momencie użytkownik zdecyduje, że nie chce, aby jego dane osobowe były wykorzystywane w celu umożliwienia stronom trzecim wyświetlania reklam lub personalizacji wyświetlanych reklam, może również dostosować swoje ustawienia za pomocą narzędzi dostarczonych przez osoby trzecie, takie jak Google, Facebook i LinkedIn.

**Funkcja Do not track (Nie śledź/Bez śledzenia)**

Niektóre przeglądarki internetowe mogą przesyłać sygnały „nie śledź/bez śledzenia” do Witryn, z którymi użytkownik się komunikuje. W związku z tym, że przeglądarki zawierają i aktywują tę funkcję na różne sposoby, nie zawsze wiadomo, czy użytkownicy zamierzają przekazywać takie sygnały, a nawet czy w ogóle o nich wiedzą. Nie możemy podejmować działań w odpowiedzi na te sygnały. Użytkownik może również wyłączyć niektóre działania dotyczące śledzenia (np. wyłączenie plików cookie), a także zrezygnować z reklamy ukierunkowanej, postępując zgodnie z instrukcjami zawartymi w sekcji „[Wyłączanie plików cookie i rezygnacja z reklam opartych na zainteresowaniach](#disablingcookies-polish)”.

Quando volta a visitar os nossos Sites, as nossas tecnologias ligam-se automaticamente ao Cookie para identificar o utilizador ou o seu Dispositivo e recuperar informações sobre si, tais como a sua preferência de idioma ou informações de início de sessão. Utilizamos também cookies de terceiros, que são cookies de um domínio diferente do domínio do website que está a visitar e que permitem a nós, ao terceiro proprietário dos cookies e, em alguns casos, a outros participantes em redes de cookies, identificar o utilizador ou o seu Dispositivo ao visitar diferentes websites. Utilizamos a palavra "Cookies" para incluir uma porção de texto, píxeis, gifs limpos, ficheiros de registo, web beacons ou outra tecnologia semelhante de rastreamento que são colocados nos seus Dispositivos.

**Existem quatro tipos de cookies que podemos utilizar:**

* **Cookies estritamente necessários** são necessários para o funcionamento dos nossos Sites e para lhe fornecer os serviços e as informações que nos solicitou. Os cookies estritamente necessários estão isentos do requisito de consentimento.

Por exemplo, permitem que os nossos Sites memorizem informações que o utilizador faculta, como preferências de idioma, e armazenar informações técnicas úteis para as suas interações com os nossos Sites. Podem ser estabelecidos por nós ou por fornecedores terceiros cujos serviços adicionámos aos nossos Sites.  Se não permitir estes cookies, alguns ou todos estes serviços poderão não funcionar corretamente.
* **Cookies de desempenho** recolhem informações sobre a sua utilização dos nossos Sites (por exemplo, permite-nos contabilizar as visitas e as origens de tráfego) e ajudam-nos a conhecer o desempenho dos nossos Sites, para que possamos fazer melhorias relevantes que otimizariam a sua experiência de navegação (por exemplo, permite-nos saber quais são as páginas mais e as menos populares). Todas as informações que estes cookies recolhem são agregadas e, portanto, anónimas.
* **Cookies de publicidade/segmentação** recolhem dados sobre a sua atividade online e identificam os seus interesses, para que possamos criar um perfil para si e fornecer-lhe publicidade mais relevante. Também desempenham funções como impedir que os mesmos anúncios reapareçam continuamente, assegurar que os anúncios são devidamente apresentados, e selecionar anúncios que se baseiam nos seus interesses.

**Por que motivo utilizamos Cookies e outras tecnologias semelhantes?**

Utilizamos Cookies e outras tecnologias semelhantes de rastreio para os seguintes fins:

*  Armazenar as suas preferências e definições;
* Permitir ao utilizador iniciar sessão e ser autenticado para que possa aceder aos nossos Sites e passar de página em página nos nossos Sites;
* Proteger os nossos Sites, incluindo deteção e prevenção de fraudes;
* Adaptar as informações que lhe são apresentadas com base nas suas preferências de navegação, tais como o idioma e a região geográfica;

As informações armazenadas nos Cookies dos nossos Sites são utilizadas exclusivamente por nós (ou por terceiros a agir em nosso nome), com exceção dos Cookies de terceiros que são utilizados e geridos por entidades externas para fornecer serviços solicitados por nós para melhorar os nossos serviços e a sua experiência na navegação dos nossos Sites. Para obter mais informações sobre os cookies originais e de terceiros que a Honeywell utiliza, visite o nosso [Centro de Preferências de Privacidade](#)**.**

**E quanto aos Flash Cookies ou Objetos de Partilha Local (Local Shared Objects)?**  
  
Podemos utilizar Flash Cookies ou Objetos de Partilha Local ("Flash LSOs") para armazenar as preferências do seu website, personalizar a sua visita, prevenir fraudes e para outras operações do website. Se não quiser Flash LSOs armazenados no computador, pode ajustar as definições do Flash Player para bloquear o armazenamento de Flash LSOs com as ferramentas contidas no Painel de Definições de Armazenamento de Websites. Também pode controlar os Flash LSOs ao aceder ao Painel de Definições de Armazenamento Global e seguir as instruções (que podem incluir explicações, por exemplo, sobre como eliminar os Flash LSOs existentes).

**Publicidade Direcionada**

Rastreamos e analisamos tanto a utilização individualizada como a informação estatística agregada relacionada com a sua utilização dos nossos Sites. Também estabelecemos parcerias com terceiros (tais como anunciantes e parceiros de publicidade) para apresentar publicidade nos nossos Sites e para gerir e apresentar publicidade noutros sites de terceiros. Estes terceiros utilizam cookies e tecnologias de rastreio semelhantes para recolher e utilizar certas informações sobre as suas atividades online, quer nos nossos Sites, quer noutros sites de terceiros, para avaliar e rastrear a eficácia dos anúncios e das nossas atividades de marketing online (por exemplo, ao recolher dados sobre quantas vezes clica num dos nossos anúncios). Estas informações podem ser utilizadas isoladamente ou em combinação com informações sobre si que obtemos de outras origens (como os nossos parceiros de dados), os seus dados de contacto e o histórico de transações da Honeywell para inferir os seus interesses e apresentar-lhe anúncios e marketing direcionados que são mais adaptados com base nas suas atividades de navegação e interesses inferidos ("Publicidade Baseada em Interesses"). Esta Publicidade Baseada em Interesses só será apresentada quando permitido pela lei aplicável e de acordo com as suas preferências de publicidade/marketing. Tenha em atenção que as tecnologias e os cookies de outros terceiros são regulamentados pela política de privacidade específica de cada empresa e não por este Aviso de Cookies.

**Rastreio entre dispositivos e sites**

Nós, os nossos fornecedores de serviços e outros terceiros (como a Google e outros parceiros de publicidade) podemos utilizar informações que recolhemos sobre o utilizador (quer diretamente dos nossos Sites ou de terceiros) para efeitos de reconhecimento online, ao identificar os Dispositivos que este utiliza. Utilizamos estas informações para lhe apresentar [publicidade direcionada](#targetedadvertising-portuguese) através de vários Dispositivos diferentes ("correspondência entre dispositivos") e sites ("rastreio entre sites"). A correspondência entre dispositivos e o rastreio entre sites permitem-nos compreender melhor a atividade do nosso cliente, melhorar a nossa capacidade de direcionar e avaliar campanhas publicitárias (incluindo a limitação do número de vezes que um utilizador vê um anúncio). Ajuda-nos também a corresponder Dispositivos para que possamos facilitar as suas escolhas de opção de exclusão em todos os Dispositivos que sabemos estarem associados a um cookie desativado.

**Desativação de cookies e exclusão de Publicidade Baseada em Interesses**

Pode fazer escolhas sobre a receção de cookies ao utilizar o nosso [Centro de Preferências de Privacidade](#) ou, em alternativa, as definições do seu browser devem permitir-lhe eliminar e/ou desativar os cookies dos websites. Para obter mais informações sobre como eliminar os cookies no browser, consulte as instruções do seu browser: [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=pt),  [Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/pt-pt/windows/eliminar-e-gerir-cookies-168dab11-0753-043d-7c16-ede5947fc64d), [Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/pt-pt/windows/microsoft-edge-dados-de-navega%25C3%25A7%25C3%25A3o-e-privacidade-bb8174ba-9d73-dcf2-9b4a-c582b4e640dd), [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/pt-PT/kb/limpar-cookies-e-dados-de-site-no-firefox), [Opera,](https://help.opera.com/en/latest/web-preferences/#cookies) Safari ([Mac](https://support.apple.com/pt-pt/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac), [iPhone, iPad ou iPod touch](https://support.apple.com/pt-pt/HT201265)).

Se optar por desativar os cookies, poderá encontrar Sites que talvez não funcionem da mesma forma. Alguns cookies são necessários para registar e respeitar as escolhas efetuadas em relação a não entrarem em contacto consigo ou a não ter outros tipos de cookies adicionados ao seu Dispositivo. Se eliminar cookies do computador, o cookie utilizado para reconhecer as suas preferências, incluindo a Publicidade Baseada em Interesses, também será eliminado, o que requer que efetue novamente as suas escolhas.

Os utilizadores também podem optar pela exclusão de redes de anúncios de terceiros através da utilização de vários websites de associações comerciais, tais como:

* Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) - [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/)
* Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) – (i) Global: [https://optout.aboutads.info/](https://optout.aboutads.info/); (ii) Europa: [http://youronlinechoices.eu/](http://youronlinechoices.eu/)

A exclusão da Publicidade Baseada em Interesses irá excluir o utilizador do fornecimento de conteúdos ou anúncios baseados em interesses por parte destas empresas, mas não significa que deixará de receber qualquer publicidade através do nosso website ou de outros websites. Poderá ainda ver anúncios da Honeywell, mas esses anúncios não serão personalizados pela Honeywell ou pelos nossos parceiros. Se, em qualquer altura, não quiser que as suas informações pessoais sejam utilizadas para permitir a apresentação de anúncios por terceiros ou para personalizar os anúncios que lhe são apresentados, poderá também ajustar as definições ao utilizar as ferramentas disponibilizadas por terceiros, como Google, Facebook e LinkedIn.

**Não Monitorizar (Do Not Track - DNT)**

Alguns browsers podem transmitir sinais "não monitorizar" aos Sites com os quais comunica. Devido a diferenças na forma como os browsers incorporam e ativam esta funcionalidade, nem sempre é claro se os utilizadores pretendem que estes sinais sejam transmitidos ou se estão cientes dos mesmos.  Podemos não agir em resposta a estes sinais. Pode também desativar certos rastreios (por exemplo, ao desativar cookies) e pode também optar por não receber publicidade direcionada ao seguir as instruções na secção [Desativação de cookies e exclusão de Publicidade Baseada em Interesses](#disablingcookies-portuguese).

* **Module cookie strict necesare** sunt necesare pentru ca site-urile noastre să funcționeze și să vă ofere serviciile și informațiile pe care le-ați solicitat. Cookie-urile strict necesare sunt scutite de cerința de consimțământ.
* **Module cookie funcționale** permit funcționalitate și personalizare îmbunătățite. De exemplu, acestea permit site-urilor noastre să-și amintească informațiile pe care le furnizați, cum ar fi preferințele dvs. de limbă și să stocheze informații tehnice utile pentru interacțiunile dvs. cu site-urile noastre. Acestea pot fi setate de noi sau de furnizori terți ale căror servicii le-am adăugat la site-urile noastre.  Dacă nu permiteți aceste cookie-uri, este posibil ca unele sau toate aceste servicii să nu funcționeze corect.
* **Module cookie de performanță** colectează informații despre utilizarea site-urilor noastre (de exemplu, ne permite să numărăm vizitele și sursele de trafic) și ne ajută să aflăm cum funcționează site-urile noastre, astfel încât să putem face modificări relevante care ar putea îmbunătăți experiența dvs. de navigare (de exemplu, ne permite să știți ce pagini sunt cele mai populare și cele mai puțin populare). Toate informațiile pe care aceste module cookie le colectează sunt agregate și, prin urmare, anonime.
* **Module cookie de publicitate/direcționare** colectează date despre activitatea dvs. online și vă identifică interesele, astfel încât să putem crea un profil pentru dvs. și să vă oferim o publicitate care este mai relevantă pentru dvs. De asemenea, acestea îndeplinesc funcții precum prevenirea reapariției continue a acelorași anunțuri, asigurarea afișării corespunzătoare a anunțurilor și selectarea anunțurilor care se bazează pe interesele dvs.

**Publicitate orientată specific**

Urmărim și analizăm atât utilizarea individualizată, cât și informațiile statistice agregate legate de utilizarea site-urilor noastre. De asemenea, colaborăm cu terțe părți (cum ar fi agenții de publicitate și parteneri publicitari) pentru a afișa reclame pe site-urile noastre și pentru a gestiona și difuza reclame pe alte site-uri ale terțelor părți. Aceste terțe părți utilizează module cookie și tehnologii similare de urmărire pentru a colecta și utiliza anumite informații despre activitățile dvs. online, fie pe site-urile noastre sau pe alte site-uri ale terțelor părți pentru a măsura și urmări eficacitatea reclamelor și a activităților noastre de marketing online (de exemplu, prin colectarea de date de câte ori faceți clic pe una dintre reclamele noastre). Aceste informații pot fi folosite singure sau în combinație cu informații despre dvs. pe care le obținem din alte surse (cum ar fi partenerii noștri de date), detaliile dvs. de contact și istoricul tranzacțiilor Honeywell pentru a deduce interesele dvs. și pentru a vă oferi reclame și marketing orientate mai mult spre dvs. pe baza activităților dvs. de navigare și a intereselor deduse („Publicitate bazată pe interese”). O astfel de publicitate bazată pe interese va fi livrată numai acolo unde este permis de legislația aplicabilă și în conformitate cu preferințele dvs. de publicitate/marketing. Vă rugăm să rețineți că modulele cookie și tehnologiile altor terțe părți sunt guvernate de politica de confidențialitate specifică fiecărei companii și nu de această Notificare privind modulele cookie.

**Urmărire pe mai multe dispozitive și pe mai multe site-uri**

Noi, furnizorii noștri de servicii și alte terțe părți (cum ar fi Google și alți parteneri publicitari) putem folosi informațiile pe care le colectăm despre dvs. (fie direct de pe site-urile noastre sau de la o terță parte) în scopul recunoașterii dvs. online prin identificarea dispozitivelor pe care le utilizați. Folosim aceste informații pentru a vă oferi [publicitate direcționată](#targetedadvertising-rom) pe mai multe dispozitive diferite („potrivire pe mai multe dispozitive”) și site-uri („urmărire pe mai multe site-uri”). Potrivirea pe mai multe dispozitive și urmărirea pe mai multe site-uri ne permite să înțelegem mai bine activitatea clienților noștri, să ne îmbunătățim capacitatea de a viza specific și măsura campaniile publicitare (inclusiv limitarea numărului de câte ori un utilizator vede o reclamă). De asemenea, ne ajută să potrivim dispozitivele, astfel încât să vă putem facilita opțiunile de renunțare pe toate dispozitivele pe care le știm că sunt conectate la un cookie de renunțare.

**Dezactivarea modulelor cookie și renunțarea la publicitatea bazată pe interese**

Puteți face alegeri cu privire la primirea cookie-urilor utilizând Centrul [nostru de preferințe pentru confidențialitate](#) sau, alternativ, setările browser-ului dvs. ar trebui să vă permită să ștergeți și/sau să dezactivați cookie-urile site-ului web.

**Nu urmări (DNT)**

Unele browsere web pot transmite semnale „nu urmări” site-urilor cu care comunicați. Deoarece diferite browsere web încorporează și activează această caracteristică în mod diferit, nu este întotdeauna clar dacă utilizatorul intenționează ca aceste semnale să fie transmise, sau dacă are măcar cunoștință despre aceste semnale.  Este posibil să nu acționăm ca răspuns la aceste semnale. De asemenea, puteți dezactiva anumite urmăriri (de exemplu, prin dezactivarea cookie-urilor) și puteți, de asemenea, să renunțați la publicitatea direcționată urmând instrucțiunile din secțiunea „[Dezactivarea modulelor cookie și renunțarea la publicitatea bazată pe interese](#disablingcookies-rom)".

В настоящем Уведомлении о файлах cookie описывается, как Honeywell International Inc. и ее аффилированные лица (далее в совокупности именуемые (**"Honeywell", "мы", "нас"**) используют файлы cookie и аналогичные технологии, установленные на устройствах, таких как компьютер, мобильное устройство или планшет (**"Устройства"**), посетителей или пользователей нашего веб-сайта, продуктов и (или) приложений (**"Веб-сайты"**).

Файлы cookie и аналогичные технологии могут обрабатывать персональные данные. Вы можете посетить:

* веб-сайт с нашим [Заявлением о конфиденциальности](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/privacy-statement#russian), если вам необходимы дополнительные сведения о том, как мы обрабатываем персональные данные и как вы можете воспользоваться своими правами субъекта данных:
* наш [Центр настроек конфиденциальности](#) для получения дополнительной информации об используемых на наших Веб-сайтах конкретных файлах cookie и для управления своими настройками файлов cookie.

**Что такое файлы cookie?**

Файлы cookie — это небольшие текстовые файлы, которые наши Веб-сайты размещают на ваших устройствах. При повторном посещении наших Веб-сайтов наши технологии автоматически подключаются к файлам cookie, чтобы идентифицировать вас или ваше устройство и восстановить информацию о вас, например о ваших языковых предпочтениях или данных для входа. Мы также используем сторонние файлы cookie, которые представляют собой файлы cookie из домена, отличного от домена веб-сайта, который вы посещаете, что позволяет нам, третьей стороне, которой принадлежат эти файлы cookie, а в некоторых случаях и другим участникам сетей файлов cookie идентифицировать вас или ваше устройство при посещении вами разных веб-сайтов. Под словом cookie мы понимаем фрагменты текста, пиксели, прозрачные GIF-файлы, файлы журналов, веб-маяки или другие подобные технологии отслеживания, которые размещаются на ваших устройствах.

**Мы можем использовать четыре типа файлов cookie.**

* **Строго необходимые файлы cookie** необходимы для работы наших Веб-сайтов и предоставления вам запрашиваемых вами услуг и информации. Строго необходимые файлы cookie не требуют согласия для их использования.
* **Функциональные файлы cookie** обеспечивают расширенную функциональность и персонализацию. Например, эти файлы позволяют хранить информацию, предоставляемую вами, например настройки языка и техническую информацию, полезную для вашего взаимодействия с нашими Веб-сайтами. Они могут быть установлены нами или сторонними поставщиками, чьи услуги мы добавили на наши Веб-сайты. Если вы не разрешите использование этих файлов cookie, некоторые или все эти службы могут работать некорректно.
* **Файлы cookie, отвечающие за производительность**, собирают информацию об использовании вами наших Веб-сайтов (например, это позволяет нам подсчитывать посещения и источники трафика) и помогают нам узнавать, как работают наши Веб-сайты, чтобы мы могли вносить соответствующие улучшения, которые могут повысить для вас удобство работы с Веб-сайтами (например, это позволяет нам узнавать, какие страницы являются наиболее и наименее популярными). Вся информация, собираемая этими файлами cookie, является сводной и, следовательно, анонимной.
* **Рекламные/целевые файлы cookie** собирают данные о вашей онлайн-активности и определяют ваши интересы, чтобы мы могли создать для вас профиль и предоставлять более актуальную для вас рекламу. Они также выполняют такие функции, как предотвращение постоянного повторения одних и тех же рекламных объявлений, обеспечение правильного отображения рекламы и выбор рекламных объявлений, основанных на ваших интересах.

Для получения дополнительных сведений о файлах cookie, используемых компанией Honeywell, посетите наш [Центр настроек конфиденциальности](#).

**Почему мы используем файлы cookie и другие подобные технологии?**

Мы используем файлы cookie и другие подобные технологии отслеживания для следующих целей:

* сохранение ваших предпочтений и настроек;
* предоставление возможности входа в систему и аутентификации, чтобы вы могли получать доступ к нашим Веб-сайтам и переходить со страницы на страницу на наших Веб-сайтах;
* обеспечение безопасности наших Веб-сайтов, включая обнаружение и предотвращение мошенничества;
* адаптация предоставляемой вам информации на основе ваших предпочтений, таких как язык и географический регион;
* отслеживание моделей трафика пользователей на наших Веб-сайтах и сбор статистических данных об использовании вами наших Веб-сайтов для получения представления о том, как работают наши Веб-сайты и как мы можем улучшить их работу для того, чтобы улучшить ваше взаимодействие с нашими Веб-сайтами и предлагать вам наиболее подходящие услуги;
* предоставление нам деловой и маркетинговой информации;
* отслеживание пользователей, посещающих или использующих наши Веб-сайты, страницы в социальных сетях, онлайн-рекламу и маркетинговые материалы (например, по каким рекламным объявлениям был выполнен переход либо открыл ли или переслал ли пользователь электронное письмо, которое мы ему отправили);
* [таргетирование рекламы](#targetedadvertising-russian);
* [отслеживание пользователей, использующих разные устройства и разные веб-сайты](#crossdevice-russian).

**Кто использует информацию, хранящуюся в файлах cookie и аналогичных технологиях отслеживания?**

Информация, хранящаяся в файлах cookie наших Веб-сайтов, используется исключительно нами (или третьими лицами, действующими от нашего имени), за исключением сторонних файлов cookie, которые используются и управляются внешними сторонами для предоставления услуг, запрошенных нами для улучшения наших услуг и вашего опыта навигации по нашим Веб-сайтам. Для получения дополнительных сведений о наших и сторонних файлах cookie, используемых компанией Honeywell, посетите наш [Центр настроек конфиденциальности](#).

**Как обстоит дело с Flash-файлами cookie или локальными общими объектами (Local Shared Objects)?**

Мы можем использовать Flash-файлы cookie или локальные общие объекты (Flash LSO) для хранения ваших настроек веб-сайтов, персонализации ваших посещений веб-сайтов, предотвращения мошенничества и для других операций на веб-сайтах. Если вы не хотите, чтобы файлы Flash LSO хранились на вашем компьютере, вы можете настроить параметры проигрывателя Flash таким образом, чтобы блокировать хранение Flash LSO с помощью инструментов, содержащихся на панели параметров хранения данных веб-сайтов. Вы также можете управлять Flash LSO, перейдя на панель Глобальные параметры хранения» и следуя инструкциям (которые могут включать инструкции, объясняющие, например, как удалить существующие Flash LSO).

**Таргетированная реклама**

Мы отслеживаем и анализируем как индивидуальное использование, так и агрегированную статистическую информацию, связанную с использованием вами наших Веб-сайтов. Мы также сотрудничаем с третьими сторонами (такими как рекламодатели и партнеры по рекламе) для показа рекламы на наших Веб-сайтах, а также для управления и показа рекламы на сторонних веб-сайтах. Эти третьи лица используют файлы cookie и аналогичные технологии отслеживания для сбора и использования определенной информации о ваших действиях в Интернете, на наших Веб-сайтах либо на других сторонних сайтах для измерения и отслеживания эффективности рекламы и нашей маркетинговой деятельности в Интернете (например, путем сбора данных о том, сколько раз вы нажимаете на одно из наших рекламных объявлений). Эта информация может использоваться отдельно или в сочетании с информацией о вас, которую мы получаем из других источников (таких как наши партнеры по обработке данных), вашими контактными данными и историей транзакций Honeywell, чтобы определять ваши интересы и предоставлять вам целевую рекламу и маркетинг, ориентированные на вас на основе ваших действий в Интернете и предполагаемых интересов (Реклама на основе интересов). Такая реклама на основе интересов будет предоставляться только в том случае, если это разрешено действующим законодательством, а также в соответствии с вашими рекламными / маркетинговыми предпочтениями. Обратите внимание на то, что файлы cookie и технологии третьих лиц регулируются политикой конфиденциальности конкретной компании, а не настоящим Уведомлением о файлах cookie.

**Отслеживание пользователей, использующих разные устройства и разные веб-сайты**

Мы, наши поставщики услуг и другие третьи лица (такие как Google и другие партнеры по рекламе) можем использовать собираемые нами данные (напрямую с наших Веб-сайтов или от третьих лиц) для того, чтобы узнавать вас в Интернете, идентифицируя устройства, которые вы используете. Мы используем эту информацию, чтобы показывать вам [таргетированную рекламу](#targetedadvertising-russian) на разных устройствах (отслеживание разных устройств) и сайтах (отслеживание на разных сайтах). Отслеживание разных устройств и отслеживание на разных сайтах позволяет нам лучше понимать активность наших клиентов, улучшать наши возможности таргетинга и измерения рекламных кампаний (включая ограничение количества показов рекламы). Это также помогает нам сопоставлять устройства, чтобы в случае вашего отказа от использования файлов cookie мы могли отключить их на всех ваших устройствах, на которых используются такие файлы.

**Отключение файлов cookie и отказ от рекламы на основе интересов**

Вы можете настроить применение файлов cookie в нашем [Центре настроек конфиденциальности](#) либо настройки вашего браузера должны позволять вам удалять и (или) отключать файлы cookie веб-сайтов. Дополнительные сведения о том, как удалить файлы cookie в вашем веб-браузере, см. в инструкциях вашего браузера: [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en), [Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies), [Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4468242/microsoft-edge-browsing-data-and-privacy), [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/clear-cookies-and-site-data-firefox), [Opera](https://help.opera.com/en/latest/web-preferences/#cookies), Safari ([Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac), [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265), [iPad или iPod touch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265)).

Если вы решите отключить файлы cookie, вы можете столкнуться с изменениями в работе Веб-сайтов. Некоторые файлы cookie необходимы для сохранения и соблюдения ваших предпочтений, касающихся отказа от отправки вам сообщений или добавления других типов файлов cookie на ваше устройство. Если вы удалите файлы cookie со своего компьютера, файлы cookie, используемые для распознавания ваших предпочтений, в том числе в отношении рекламы на основе интересов, также будут удалены, и вам придется снова указывать свои предпочтения.

Пользователи также могут отказаться от услуг сторонних рекламных сетей, используя веб-сайты различных отраслевых ассоциаций, такие как:

* Network Advertising Initiative (Инициатива по рекламе в сети Интернет) — [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/)
* Digital Advertising alliance (Альянс цифровой рекламы, DAA)) — (i) глобальный веб-сайт: [https://optout.aboutads.info/](https://optout.aboutads.info/); (ii) Европа: [http://youronlinechoices.eu/](http://youronlinechoices.eu/)

После отказа от рекламы на основе интересов эти компании не будут предоставлять вам контент или рекламу на основе интересов, но это не означает, что вы больше не будете видеть рекламу на наших и других веб-сайтах. Вы по-прежнему будете видеть рекламу компании Honeywell, но она не будет адаптирована для вас компанией Honeywell или нашими партнерами. Если вы захотите, чтобы ваши персональные данные не использовались для показа или персонализации рекламы третьими лицами, вы можете изменить свои настройки с помощью инструментов, предоставляемых такими третьими лицами, например Google, Facebook и LinkedIn.

**Не отслеживать (DNT)**

Некоторые браузеры могут передавать сигналы о запрете на сбор информации о пользователе (Do Not Track) на Веб-сайты, с которыми он взаимодействует. Из-за различий в способах включения и активации этой функции в браузерах не всегда понятно, действительно ли пользователи хотят передать этот сигнал и знают ли они вообще о существовании такой возможности. Мы не можем действовать в ответ на эти сигналы. Вы также можете отключить отслеживание (например отключив файлы cookie) и отказаться от целевой рекламы, следуя инструкциям в разделе [Отключение файлов cookie и отказ от рекламы на основе интересов](#disablingcookies-russian).

Flash LSO môžete tiež ovládať tak, že prejdete na panel Nastavenia globálneho úložiska a budete postupovať podľa pokynov (ktoré môžu obsahovať pokyny, ktoré vysvetľujú napríklad odstránenie existujúcich Flash LSO).

**Cielená reklama**

Sledujeme a analyzujeme individualizované použitie a aj agregované štatistické informácie týkajúce sa vášho používania našich webových lokalít. Ďalej uzatvárame partnerstvá s tretími stranami (ako napríklad s inzerentmi a reklamnými partnermi), aby sme zobrazovali reklamu na našich webových lokalitách a spravovali a poskytovali reklamu na iných stránkach tretích strán. Tieto tretie strany používajú súbory cookie a podobné technológie sledovania na zhromažďovanie a používanie určitých informácií o vašich online aktivitách, či už na našich webových lokalitách alebo na iných stránkach tretích strán, na meranie a sledovanie efektívnosti reklám a našich online marketingových aktivít (napríklad zhromažďovaním údajov koľkokrát kliknete na niektorú z našich reklám). Tieto informácie môžu byť použité samostatne alebo v kombinácii s informáciami o vás, ktoré získavame z iných zdrojov (napríklad od našich dátových partnerov), vašimi kontaktnými údajmi a históriou transakcií spoločnosti Honeywell na vyvodenie vašich záujmov a doručenie cielených reklám a marketingu, ktoré sú pre vás viac prispôsobené na základe vašich aktivít prehliadania a odvodených záujmov („záujmovo orientovaná reklama“). Takáto záujmovo orientovaná reklama sa bude dodávať iba tam, kde to povoľujú príslušné zákony a v súlade s vašimi reklamnými/marketingovými preferenciami. Upozorňujeme, že súbory cookie a technológie tretích strán sa riadia konkrétnymi zásadami ochrany súkromia každej spoločnosti, a nie týmto oznámením o súboroch cookie.

**Sledovanie viacerých zariadení a viacerých stránok**

My, naši poskytovatelia služieb a ďalšie tretie strany (ako napríklad Google a ďalší reklamní partneri) môžeme použiť informácie, ktoré o vás zhromažďujeme (či už priamo z našich stránok alebo od tretej strany), na účely rozpoznať vás online identifikáciou zariadení, ktoré používate. Tieto informácie používame na to, aby sme vám poskytli [cielenú reklamu](#targetedadvertising-slovak) na viacerých rôznych zariadeniach („párovanie viacerých zariadení“) a stránkach („sledovanie viacerých stránok“). Párovanie viacerých zariadení a sledovanie viacerých stránok nám umožňuje lepšie pochopiť aktivitu našich zákazníkov, zlepšiť našu schopnosť zacieliť a merať reklamné kampane (vrátane obmedzenia počtu prípadov, keď sa používateľovi zobrazí reklama). Pomáha nám tiež párovať zariadenia, aby sme vám mohli uľahčiť vaše voľby odhlásenia na všetkých zariadeniach, o ktorých vieme, že sú pripojené k odhlásenému súboru cookie.

**Zakázanie súborov cookie a odhlásenie zo záujmovo orientovanej reklamy**

Ohľadom prijímania súborov cookie sa môžete rozhodnúť použitím nášho [Centra preferencií ochrany súkromia](#) alebo prípadne by vám mali nastavenia prehliadača umožniť odstránenie a/alebo zakázanie súborov cookie webových stránok. Ďalšie informácie o tom, ako odstrániť súbory cookie vo vašom webovom prehliadači, nájdete v pokynoch vášho prehliadača: [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en), [Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies), [Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4468242/microsoft-edge-browsing-data-and-privacy), [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/clear-cookies-and-site-data-firefox), [Opera](https://help.opera.com/en/latest/web-preferences/#cookies), Safari ([Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac), [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265), [iPad alebo iPod touch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265)).

Ak sa rozhodnete zakázať súbory cookie, môže sa stať, že webové lokality nebudú fungovať rovnakým spôsobom. Niektoré súbory cookie sú potrebné na zaznamenanie a rešpektovanie rozhodnutí, ktoré ste vykonali v súvislosti s tým, že vás nebudeme kontaktovať alebo že do vášho zariadenia nebudú pridané iné typy súborov cookie. Ak z počítača odstránite súbory cookie, odstránia sa aj súbory cookie, ktoré sa používajú na rozpoznanie vašich preferencií vrátane záujmovo orientovanej reklamy, čo od vás vyžaduje znova sa rozhodnúť.

Používatelia sa tiež môžu odhlásiť z reklamných sietí tretích strán pomocou použitia rôznych webových stránok obchodných združení, ako napríklad:

* Sieť Iniciatíva v oblasti reklamy (NAI) – [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/)
* Aliancia digitálnej reklamy (DAA) – (i) Celý svet: [https://optout.aboutads.info/](https://optout.aboutads.info/); (ii) Európa: [http://youronlinechoices.eu/](http://youronlinechoices.eu/)

Odhlásenie zo záujmovo orientovanej reklamy vás odhlási z doručovania záujmovo orientovaného obsahu alebo reklám od týchto spoločností, ale neznamená to, že už nebudete dostávať žiadnu reklamu prostredníctvom našich webových stránok alebo iných webových stránok. Stále sa vám môžu zobrazovať reklamy spoločnosti Honeywell, ale tieto reklamy vám spoločnosť Honeywell alebo naši partneri neprispôsobia. Ak kedykoľvek nebudete chcieť, aby boli vaše osobné údaje použité na umožnenie tretím stranám zobrazovať reklamy alebo prispôsobovať reklamy, ktoré sa vám zobrazujú, môžete svoje nastavenia upraviť aj pomocou nástrojov poskytovaných tretími stranami, ako sú napr. Google, Facebook a LinkedIn.

**Zákaz sledovania (DNT)**

Niektoré webové prehliadače môžu prenášať na webové lokality, s ktorými komunikujete, signály zakazujúce sledovanie. Z dôvodu rozdielov v spôsoboch, akými webové prehliadače integrujú a aktivujú túto funkciu, nie je vždy jasné, či používatelia chcú prenášať tieto signály alebo či o nich vôbec vedia. Na tieto signály nemusíme reagovať. Môžete tiež zakázať určité sledovanie (napr. zakázaním súborov cookie) a tiež sa môžete odhlásiť z cielenej reklamy postupovaním podľa pokynov v časti "[Zakázanie súborov cookie a odhlásenie zo záujmovo orientovanej reklamy](#disablingcookies-slovak)“.

Este aviso de cookies describe cómo Honeywell International Inc. y sus afiliados (conjuntamente "**Honeywell**", "**nos**" o "**nosotros**") utilizan cookies y tecnologías similares instaladas en dispositivos como ordenadores, móviles o tabletas ("**Dispositivos**") de los visitantes o usuarios de nuestra página web, productos y/o aplicaciones ("**Sitios**").

Las cookies y las tecnologías similares pueden procesar información personal. Consulte:

* nuestra [Declaración de privacidad](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/privacy-statement#spanish) si quiere obtener más información sobre cómo procesamos su información personal y cómo ejercer sus derechos como persona interesada
* nuestro [Centro de preferencias de privacidad](#) para obtener más información sobre las cookies específicas que utilizamos en nuestros Sitios con el fin de gestionar sus preferencias de cookies.

**¿Qué son las cookies?**

Las cookies son pequeños archivos de texto que nuestros Sitios colocan en sus Dispositivos. Cuando vuelve a visitar nuestros Sitios, nuestras tecnologías se conectan automáticamente con la cookie para identificarlo a usted o a su Dispositivo y recordar su información, como sus preferencias de idioma o su información de acceso. También utilizamos cookies de terceros, que son cookies de un dominio distinto al dominio que usted está visitando, lo que nos permite a nosotros, al tercero que posee las cookies y, en algunos casos, a otros participantes en redes de cookies identificarlo a usted o a su Dispositivo al visitar distintas páginas web. Con la palabra "cookies" nos referimos a fragmentos de texto, píxeles, gifs transparentes, archivos de registro, contadores de visitantes u otras tecnologías similares de seguimiento que se colocan en su Dispositivo.

**Hay cuatro tipos de cookies que podemos utilizar:**

* **Cookies estrictamente necesarias** que son requeridas por nuestros Sitios para poder funcionar y proporcionarle los servicios e información que ha solicitado. Las cookies estrictamente necesarias están exentas del requisito de consentimiento.
* **Cookies funcionales** que permiten una funcionalidad y personalización mejoradas. Por ejemplo, permiten que nuestros Sitios recuerden información que nos proporciona, como sus preferencias de idioma, y que almacenen información útil para sus interacciones con nuestros Sitios. Las podemos establecer nosotros o los proveedores externos cuyos servicios hemos añadido a nuestros Sitios. Si no acepta estas cookies, puede que todos o algunos de estos servicios no funcionen correctamente.
* **Cookies de rendimiento** que recogen información sobre el uso que hace de nuestros Sitios (p. ej., nos permiten contabilizar las visitas y las fuentes de tráfico) y nos ayudan a descubrir cómo funcionan nuestros Sitios para poder realizar las mejoras pertinentes que podrían aumentar su experiencia de navegación (p. ej., nos permiten saber qué páginas son las más y menos populares). Toda la información que recopilan estas cookies es colectiva y, por lo tanto, anónima.
* **Cookies de publicidad/segmentación** que recogen datos sobre su actividad en línea e identifican sus intereses para que podamos crear un perfil para usted y proporcionarle anuncios más relevantes. También realizan acciones como prevenir que siempre le aparezcan los mismos anuncios, asegurar que los anuncios se muestran correctamente y seleccionar anuncios basados en sus intereses.

Para obtener más información sobre las cookies que Honeywell utiliza, visite nuestro [Centro de preferencias de privacidad](#).

**¿Por qué utilizamos cookies y otras tecnologías similares?**

Utilizamos cookies y otras tecnologías similares de seguimiento para los siguientes propósitos:

* Guardar sus preferencias y configuración;
* Permitir que inicie sesión y se autentique para que pueda acceder a nuestros Sitios y se pueda mover entre páginas dentro de nuestros Sitios;
* Proteger nuestros Sitios incluidas la detección y la prevención de fraudes;
* Adaptar la información que se le presenta en función de sus preferencias de navegación, como el idioma y la región geográfica;
* Monitorizar los patrones de tráfico de los usuarios dentro de nuestros Sitios y recopilar estadísticas sobre el uso que dan a la página web para ayudarnos a comprender cómo responden nuestros Sitios y cómo podemos mejorarlos para, por ejemplo, aumentar su experiencia de navegación y ofrecer servicios que sean más relevantes para usted;
* Proveernos de información comercial y de marketing;
* Rastrear a los usuarios que visitan, interactúan o utilizan cualquiera de nuestros Sitios, páginas de redes sociales, anuncios en línea y comunicaciones de marketing (como en qué anuncios hizo clic o si un usuario ha abierto o reenviado un correo electrónico que le hemos enviado);
* [Publicidad dirigida](#targetedadvertising-spanish); y
* [Seguimiento cruzado entre dispositivos y entre páginas web](#crossdevice-spanish).

**¿Quién utiliza la información almacenada en las cookies y en las tecnologías de seguimiento similares?**

Solo nosotros exclusivamente (o terceros que actúan en nuestro nombre) utilizan la información almacenada en las cookies de nuestros Sitios, con la excepción de las cookies de terceros, que las utilizan y gestionan terceros para proporcionar servicios solicitados por nosotros a fin de mejorar nuestros servicios y su experiencia al navegar por nuestros Sitios. Para obtener más información sobre las cookies propias y de terceros que Honeywell utiliza, visite nuestro [Centro de preferencias de privacidad](#).

**¿Y qué pasa con las cookies u objetos compartidos locales Flash?**

Puede que utilicemos cookies u objetos compartidos locales Flash ("LSO Flash") para almacenar sus preferencias de sitios web, personalizar su visita, evitar fraudes y otras operaciones del sitio. Si no quiere que su ordenador almacene "LSO Flash", puede ajustar la configuración de su reproductor Flash para bloquear el almacenamiento de "LSO Flash" utilizando las herramientas contenidas en el panel de configuración de almacenamiento del sitio web. También puede controlar los "LSO Flash" accediendo al panel de configuración global de almacenamiento y siguiendo las instrucciones (que pueden explicar, por ejemplo, cómo eliminar los "LSO Flash" existentes).

**Publicidad dirigida**

Rastreamos y analizamos tanto el uso individual como la información estadística colectiva relacionada con el uso que da a nuestros Sitios. También nos asociamos con terceros (como anunciantes y socios publicitarios) para mostrar publicidad en nuestros Sitios y gestionar y ofrecer publicidad en sitios de terceros. Estos terceros utilizan cookies y tecnologías de seguimiento similares para recopilar y utilizar determinada información sobre sus actividades en línea, tanto en nuestros Sitios como en sitios de terceros, a fin de medir y rastrear la efectividad de la publicidad y de nuestras actividades de marketing (por ejemplo, recogiendo información de cuántas veces hace clic en uno de nuestros anuncios). Esta información puede usarse por sí sola o en combinación con información sobre usted que obtengamos de otras fuentes (como nuestros socios de datos), sus datos de contacto y el historial de transacciones de Honeywell para deducir sus intereses y proporcionarle publicidad y marketing dirigidos que se adapten más a usted en función de sus actividades de navegación e intereses deducidos ("Publicidad personalizada"). Esta publicidad personalizada solo se proporcionará donde lo permita la ley aplicable y de acuerdo con sus preferencias de publicidad/marketing. Tenga en cuenta que las cookies y tecnologías de otros terceros están reguladas por la política de privacidad específica de cada compañía y no por este aviso de cookies.

**Seguimiento cruzado entre dispositivos y entre páginas web**

Nosotros, nuestros proveedores de servicios y otros terceros (como Google y otros socios publicitarios) podemos utilizar la información que recopilamos sobre usted (ya sea directamente de nuestros Sitios o de un tercero) con el propósito de reconocerlo en línea mediante la identificación de los Dispositivos que utiliza. Utilizamos esta información para ofrecerle [publicidad dirigida](#targetedadvertising-spanish) a través de distintos Dispositivos ("coincidencia cruzada entre dispositivos") y sitios ("seguimiento cruzado entre páginas web"). La coincidencia cruzada entre dispositivos y el seguimiento cruzado entre páginas web nos permite entender mejor la actividad de nuestros clientes, mejorar nuestra habilidad para orientar y medir campañas publicitarias (incluida la limitación del número de veces que un usuario ve un anuncio). También nos ayuda a combinar Dispositivos para que podamos facilitar sus opciones de rechazo en todos los Dispositivos que sabemos que están conectados a una cookie de rechazo.

**Desactivar las cookies y rechazar la publicidad personalizada**

Puede decidir si quiere recibir cookies utilizando nuestro [centro de preferencias de privacidad](#) o, como alternativa, la configuración de su navegador debería permitirle eliminar y/o desactivar las cookies del sitio web. Para obtener más información sobre cómo eliminar las cookies en su navegador web, consulte las instrucciones de su navegador: [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en),  [Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies), [Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4468242/microsoft-edge-browsing-data-and-privacy), [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/clear-cookies-and-site-data-firefox), [Opera](https://help.opera.com/en/latest/web-preferences/#cookies), Safari ([Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac), [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265), [iPad](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265), or [iPod touch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265)).

Si elige desactivar las cookies, puede que encuentre Sitios que no funcionen de la misma forma. Algunas cookies son necesarias para registrar y respetar las elecciones que haya hecho con respecto a no contactarle o no añadir otros tipos de cookies a sus Dispositivos. Si elimina estas cookies de su ordenador, la cookie utilizada para reconocer sus preferencias, incluida la publicidad personalizada, también se eliminará, por lo que se le pedirá que vuelva a realizar las elecciones.

Los usuarios pueden rechazar participar en redes publicitarias de terceros mediante el uso de varios sitios web de asociaciones comerciales, como:

* Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) - [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/)
* Digital Advertising alliance (DAA) – (i) Global: [https://optout.aboutads.info/](https://optout.aboutads.info/); (ii) Europa: [http://youronlinechoices.eu/](http://youronlinechoices.eu/)

Rechazar la publicidad personalizada lo excluirá de recibir contenido personalizado o publicidad de estas empresas, pero no significa que no vaya a recibir más publicidad a través de nuestro sitio web o de otros sitios web. Puede que siga viendo anuncios de Honeywell, pero ni Honeywell ni nuestros socios habrán personalizado estos anuncios para usted. Si en algún momento no quiere que su información personal se utilice para permitir que terceros le muestren anuncios o para personalizar los anuncios que aparezcan, también puede ajustar su configuración utilizando las herramientas proporcionadas por terceros, como: Google, Facebook y LinkedIn.

**Do Not Track (DNT)**

Algunos navegadores pueden transmitir señales "do-not-track" (no rastrear) a los Sitios con los que usted se comunica. Debido a las diferencias en la forma en que los navegadores de web incorporan y activan esta función, no siempre está claro si los usuarios quieren que se transmitan estas señales, o ni siquiera si las conocen. Es posible que no actuemos en respuesta a estas señales. También puede desactivar un seguimiento en particular (por ejemplo, al desactivar las cookies) y rechazar la publicidad personalizada siguiendo las instrucciones que se encuentran en la sección "[Desactivar las cookies y rechazar la publicidad personalizada](#disablingcookies-spanish)".

Si tiene alguna duda sobre el uso de las cookies, contacte con nosotros a través de: [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com).

**Uppdaterad: 11 juni 2021**

Detta meddelande beskriver hur Honeywell International Inc. och dess dotterbolag (tillsammans ”**Honeywell**”, ”**oss**” eller ”**vi**”) använder kakor och liknande tekniker installerade på enheter som t.ex. datorer, mobila enheter eller surfplattor (”**Enheter**”) som härrör från besökare eller användare av vår webbplats, produkter och/eller applikationer (”**Webbplatser**”).

Cookies och liknande tekniker kan behandla personlig information. Gå till:

* vår [Integritetspolicy](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/privacy-statement#swedish) om du vill få mer information om hur vi behandlar dina personuppgifter och hur du utövar dina rättigheter som registrerad
* vårt [Inställningscenter för integritet](#) för mer information om de specifika cookies vi använder på våra webbplatser och för att hantera dina cookieinställningar.

**Vad är cookies?**

Cookies är små textfiler som lagras på dina enheter av webbplatser som du besöker. När du besöker våra webbplatser på nytt ansluter vår teknik automatiskt till denna cookie för att identifiera dig eller din enhet och komma ihåg information om dig, t.ex. språkinställningar eller inloggningsinformation. Vi använder också cookies från tredje part. Dessa är cookies från en domän som skiljer sig från domänen på den webbplats du besöker vilket tillåter oss, den tredje parten som äger dessa cookies och i vissa fall andra parter i cookienätverken att identifiera dig eller din enhet när du besöker olika webbplatser. När vi använder ordet ”Cookies” syftar vi på ett stycke text, pixlar, tydliga gif:ar, loggfiler, webbfyrar eller annan liknande spårningsteknik som lagras på dina enheter.

**Vi kan använda fyra olika typer av cookies:**

* **Strikt nödvändiga cookies** behövs för att våra webbplatser ska fungera och kunna tillhandahålla de tjänster och information som du har begärt. Strikt nödvändiga cookies är undantagna från kravet på samtycke.
* **Funktionella cookies** möjliggör förbättrad funktionalitet och personanpassning. Till exempel tillåter de att våra webbplatser kommer ihåg information som du tillhandahåller, t.ex. dina språkinställningar, samt lagra teknisk information som kan vara användbar för dina interaktioner med våra webbplatser. De kan ställas in av oss eller tredjepartsleverantörer vars tjänster vi har lagt till på våra webbplatser. Om du inte tillåter dessa cookies kan det hända att vissa eller alla av dessa tjänster inte fungerar korrekt.
* **Prestandacookies** samlar in information om din användning av våra webbplatser (så att vi t.ex. kan räkna besök och trafikkällor) och gör att vi kan se hur våra webbplatser presterar och därmed åstadkomma relevanta förbättringar för att göra din surfupplevelse ännu bättre (så att vi t.ex. kan få reda på vilka sidor som är mest, respektive minst, populära). All information som dessa cookies samlar in är aggregerad och följaktligen anonym.
* **Annonserings-/riktade cookies** samlar in data om din onlineaktivitet och identifierar dina intressen så att vi kan skapa en profil åt dig och därmed visa reklam som är mer relevant för just dig. Till deras funktioner hör också att t.ex förhindra att samma annonser visas om och om igen, se till att annonser visas korrekt samt välja annonser som baseras på dina intressen.

Gå till vårt [Inställningscenter för integritet](#) för mer information om de cookies som Honeywell använder.

**Varför använder vi cookies och andra liknande tekniker?**

Vi använder cookies och andra liknande spårningstekniker för följande ändamål:

* Lagra dina preferenser och inställningar;
* Tillåta dig att logga in och autentisera dig så att du kan komma åt våra webbplatser och gå från sida till sida inom våra webbplatser;
* Säkra våra webbplatser, inklusive upptäckt och förebyggande av bedrägerier;
* Skräddarsy information som presenteras för dig baserat på dina surfinställningar, t.ex. språk och geografiskt område;
* Övervaka användarnas trafikmönster på våra webbplatser och samla in statistik om din webbplatsanvändning för att hjälpa oss förstå hur våra webbplatser presterar och hur vi kan förbättra våra webbplatser för ändamål som att t.ex. förbättra din surfupplevelse och erbjuda tjänster som är mer relevanta för just dig;
* Förse oss med företags- och marknadsföringsinformation;
* Spåra användare som besöker, interagerar med eller använder någon av våra webbplatser, sidor på sociala medier, onlineannonser och marknadsföringskommunikation (t. ex. vilka annonser man klickade på eller om en användare har öppnat eller vidarebefordrat ett e-postmeddelande som vi har skickat); och
* [Riktad annonsering](#targetedadvertising-swedish); och
* [Spårning över flera enheter och flera webbplatser](#crossdevice-swedish).

**Vem använder informationen som lagras i cookies och liknande spårningstekniker?**

Informationen som lagras i våra webbplatsers kakor används uteslutande av oss (eller av tredje part som agerar för vår räkning), med undantag för cookies från tredje part som används och hanteras av externa parter i syfte att tillhandahålla tjänster som vi begärt för att kunna förbättra våra tjänster och din upplevelse när du navigerar på våra webbplatser. Gå till vårt [Inställningscenter för integritet](#) för mer information om de första- och tredjepartscookies som Honeywell använder.

**Vad gäller i fallet med Flash-cookies eller lokala delade objekt?**

Vi kan använda Flash-cookies eller lokala delade objekt (”Flash LSO”) för att lagra dina webbplatsinställningar, personanpassa ditt besök, förhindra bedrägeri och för annan webbplatsverksamhet. Om du inte vill att Flash LSO ska lagras på din dator kan du ändra inställningarna för din Flash Player för att blockera att Flash LSO lagras med hjälp av verktygen som finns i panelen Lagringsinställningar för webbplatser. Du kan även reglera hanteringen av Flash LSO genom att gå till panelen Globala sekretessinställningar och följa anvisningarna (vilka kan innehålla instruktioner som förklarar t.ex. hur man raderar befintliga Flash LSO).

**Riktad annonsering**

Vi spårar och analyserar både individualiserad användning och aggregerad statistisk information relaterad till din användning av våra webbplatser. Vi samarbetar också med tredje parter (som t.ex. annonsörer och annonspartners) för att visa reklam på våra webbplatser samt hantera och betjäna reklam på andra tredjepartswebbplatser. Dessa tredje parter använder cookies och liknande spårningstekniker för att samla in och använda viss information om dina onlineaktiviteter, antingen på våra webbplatser eller andra tredjepartswebbplatser, i syfte att mäta och spåra annonsernas effektivitet såväl som våra marknadsföringsaktiviteter online (t.ex. genom att samla in data om hur många gånger du klickar på en av våra annonser). Denna information kan användas ensam eller i kombination med information om dig som vi erhåller från andra källor (som våra datapartner), dina kontaktuppgifter och Honeywells transaktionshistorik för att driva dina intressen och tillhandahålla riktade annonser och marknadsföring som är mer skräddarsydd för just dig, baserat på dina surfaktiviteter och härledda intressen (”Intressebaserad annonsering”). Sådan intressebaserad annonsering kommer endast att tillhandahållas där det är tillåtet enligt tillämplig lag och i enlighet med dina annonserings-/marknadsföringsinställningar. Observera att andra tredjepartscookies och teknik styrs av varje företags specifika sekretesspolicy och inte detta meddelande om cookies.

**Spårning över flera enheter och flera webbplatser**

Vi, våra tjänsteleverantörer och andra tredje parter (som t.ex. Google och andra annonspartner) kan använda informationen vi samlar in om dig (vare sig direkt från våra webbplatser eller från tredje part) i syfte att känna igen dig online genom att identifiera de enheter som du använder. Vi använder den här informationen för att ge dig [riktad annonsering](#targetedadvertising-swedish) över flera olika enheter (”matchning över flera enheter”) och webbplatser (”spårning över flera platser”). Matchning över flera enheter och spårning över flera webbplatser gör det möjligt för oss att bättre förstå våra kunders aktivitet, förbättra vår förmåga att rikta in oss på och mäta annonskampanjer (inklusive att begränsa antalet gånger en användare ser en annons). Det hjälper oss också att matcha enheter så att vi kan underlätta dina val av borttagning på samtliga enheter som vi vet är anslutna till en sådan borttagningscookie.

**Inaktivera cookies och välja bort intressebaserad reklam**

Du kan välja hur du vill ta emot cookies i vårt [Inställningscenter för integritet](#), alternativt så bör dina webbläsarinställningar tillåta dig att radera och/eller inaktivera webbplatscookies. Mer information om hur du raderar cookies i din webbläsare hittar du i respektive webbläsares instruktioner: [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en), [Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies), [Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4468242/microsoft-edge-browsing-data-and-privacy), [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/clear-cookies-and-site-data-firefox), [Opera](https://help.opera.com/en/latest/web-preferences/#cookies), Safari ([Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac), [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265), [iPad eller iPod touch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265)).

Om du väljer att inaktivera cookies kan det hända att webbplatser kanske inte fungerar på samma sätt. Vissa cookies är nödvändiga för att kunna registrera och respektera de val du har gjort när det gäller att inte kontaktas eller att andra typer av cookies inte ska läggas till på din enhet. Om du tar bort cookies från din dator kommer den cookie som används för att känna igen dina inställningar, inklusive intressebaserad annonsering, att raderas och du behöver därför göra dina val på nytt.

Användare kan också välja bort tredje parters annonsnätverk genom användning av olika branschorganisationers webbplatser, som t.ex.:

* Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) - [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/)
* Digital Advertising alliance (DAA) – (i) Globalt: [https://optout.aboutads.info/](https://optout.aboutads.info/); (ii) Europa: [http://youronlinechoices.eu/](http://youronlinechoices.eu/)

Att välja bort intressebaserad annonsering kommer att välja bort dessa företags tillhandahållande av intressebaserat innehåll eller annonser till dig men betyder inte att du inte längre kommer att se någon annonsering alls på vår webbplats eller andra webbplatser. Du kan fortfarande se annonser från Honeywell, men dessa annonser kommer inte att vara anpassade för just dig av Honeywell eller någon av våra partner. Om du vid någon tidpunkt inte vill att din personliga information ska användas för att tillåta tredje parter att visa annonser eller att anpassa annonser som visas för dig kan du också justera dina inställningar med hjälp av de verktyg som tillhandahålls av tredje part, t.ex. Google, Facebook och LinkedIn.

**Spåra inte (DNT, Do Not Track)**

Vissa webbläsare kan skicka ”spåra inte”-signaler till webbplatser som du kommunicerar med. Eftersom olika webbläsare införlivar och aktiverar den här funktionen på olika sätt är det inte alltid klart om användarna verkligen avser att skicka de här signalerna eller om de ens är medvetna om dem. Det kan hända att vi inte agerar som svar på dessa signaler. Du kan också inaktivera viss spårning (t.ex. genom att inaktivera cookies) och du kan också välja bort riktad annonsering genom att följa instruktionerna i avsnittet ”[Inaktivera cookies och välja bort intressebaserad annonsering](#disablingcookies-swedish)”.

Bunlar, ziyaret ettiğiniz web sitesinin etki alanından farklı bir etki alanından bize, çerezlere sahip olan üçüncü tarafa ve bazı durumlarda, farklı web sitelerini ziyaret ederken çerez ağlarındaki diğer katılımcılara sizi veya Cihazınızı tanımlama olanağı sağlayan çerezlerdir. Cihazlarınıza yerleştirilen bir metin, piksel, net gif, günlük dosyası, web işaretçisi veya diğer benzer izleme teknolojilerini kapsamak için "Çerezler" kelimesini kullanıyoruz.

**Kullanabileceğimiz dört tür çerez vardır:**

* **Kesinlikle gerekli çerezler** Sitelerimizin çalışması ve talep ettiğiniz hizmetleri ve bilgileri size sağlaması için gereklidir. Kesinlikle gerekli çerezler, onay gerekliliğinden muaftır.
* **İşlevsel çerezler** gelişmiş işlevsellik ve kişiselleştirmeyi etkinleştirir. Örneğim, Sitelerimizin, dil tercihleriniz gibi sağladığınız bilgileri hatırlamasını ve Sitelerimizle etkileşiminiz için kullanışlı olan teknik bilgileri saklamasını sağlar. Bunlar bizim tarafımızdan veya Hizmetlerini Sitelerimize eklediğimiz üçüncü taraf sağlayıcılar tarafından belirlenebilir. Bu çerezlere izin vermezseniz, bu hizmetlerin bazıları veya tümü düzgün çalışmayabilir.
* **Performans çerezleri** Sitelerimizi kullanımınız hakkında bilgi toplar (örneğin, ziyaretleri ve trafik kaynaklarını saymamızı sağlar) ve Sitelerimizin nasıl performans gösterdiğini öğrenmemize yardımcı olur (örneğin, hangi sayfaların en çok ve en az popüler olduğunu öğrenmemizi sağlar), böylece tarama deneyiminizi iyileştirebilecek ilgili iyileştirmeler yapabiliriz. Bu çerezlerin topladığı tüm bilgiler bir araya getirilir ve bu nedenle bilgiler anonimdir.
* **Reklam/hedefleme çerezleri** sizin bir profilinizi oluşturabilmemiz ve sizinle daha alakalı reklamlar sunabilmemiz için çevrimiçi etkinliğiniz hakkında veri toplar ve ilgi alanlarınızı belirler. Aynı reklamların sürekli olarak yeniden görünmesini engelleme, reklamların düzgün görüntülenmesini sağlama ve ilgi alanlarınıza göre reklamları seçme gibi işlevleri de yerine getirirler.

**Neden Çerezleri ve diğer benzer teknolojileri kullanıyoruz?**

Çerezleri ve diğer benzer izleme teknolojilerini aşağıdaki amaçlarla kullanıyoruz:

* Tercihlerinizi ve ayarlarınızı saklamak;
* Sitelerimize erişebilmeniz ve Sitelerimizde sayfadan sayfaya geçebilmeniz için oturum açmanızı ve kimliğinizi doğrulamanızı sağlamak;
* Dolandırıcılık tespiti ve önlenmesi dahil olmak üzere Sitelerimizi güvenli hale getirmek;
* Dil ve coğrafi bölge gibi tarama tercihlerinize göre size sunulan bilgileri uyarlamak;
* Sitelerimizin nasıl performans gösterdiğini ve tarama deneyiminizi geliştirmek ve sizinle daha alakalı hizmetler sunmak gibi amaçlarla Sitelerimizi nasıl iyileştirebileceğimizi anlamamıza yardımcı olması için Sitelerimizdeki kullanıcıların trafik modellerini izlemek ve web sitenizin kullanımıyla ilgili istatistikler toplamak;
* Tarafımıza iş ve pazarlama bilgilerini sağlamak;
* Sitelerimizi, sosyal medya sayfalarımızı, çevrimiçi reklamlarımızı ve pazarlama iletişimlerimizi ziyaret eden, bunlarla etkileşime giren veya bunları kullanan kullanıcıları takip etmek (örneğin hangi reklamların tıklandığı veya bir kullanıcının kendilerine gönderdiğimiz bir e-postayı açıp açmadığı gibi); ve
* [Hedefli Reklamcılık](#targetedadvertising-turkish); ve
* [Cihazlar arası ve siteler arası izleme](#crossdevice-turkish).

**Çerezler ve benzeri izleme teknolojilerinde saklanan bilgileri kimler kullanır?**

Sitelerimizin Çerezlerinde saklanan bilgiler, hizmetlerimizi ve Sitelerimizde gezinirken yaşadığınız deneyimi iyileştirmek amacıyla tarafımızdan talep edilen hizmetleri sağlamak için dış taraflarca kullanılan ve yönetilen üçüncü taraf Çerezler hariç, münhasıran bizim tarafımızdan (veya bizim adımıza hareket eden üçüncü taraflarca) kullanılır. Honeywell'in kullandığı birinci taraf ve üçüncü taraf çerezler hakkında daha fazla bilgi için [Gizlilik Tercih Merkezi](#) sayfamızı ziyaret edin.

**Flash Çerezleri veya Yerel Paylaşılan Nesneler nedir?**

Web sitesi tercihlerinizi saklamak, ziyaretinizi kişiselleştirmek, dolandırıcılığı önlemek ve diğer site işlemleri için Flash Çerezlerini veya Yerel Paylaşılan Nesneleri ("Flash LSO'lar") kullanabiliriz. Flash LSO'ların bilgisayarınızda depolanmasını istemiyorsanız, Web Sitesi Depolama Ayarları Panelinde bulunan araçları kullanarak Flash player'ınızın ayarlarını Flash LSO'ların depolanmasını engelleyecek şekilde ayarlayabilirsiniz. Flash LSO'ları, Genel Saklama Ayarları Paneline gidip talimatları (örneğin, mevcut Flash LSO'ların nasıl silineceğini açıklayan talimatlar bulunabilir) takip ederek de kontrol edebilirsiniz.

**Hedefli Reklamcılık**

Sitelerimizi kullanımınızla ilgili hem bireyselleştirilmiş kullanımı hem de toplu istatistiksel bilgileri izleyip analiz ediyoruz. Bununla birlikte, Sitelerimizde reklam görüntülemek ve diğer üçüncü taraf sitelerindeki reklamları yönetmek ve sunmak için üçüncü taraflarla (reklam verenler ve reklam ortakları gibi) ortaklık yapıyoruz. Bu üçüncü taraflar, reklamların ve çevrimiçi pazarlama faaliyetlerimizin etkinliğini ölçmek ve izlemek amacıyla Sitelerimizde veya diğer üçüncü taraf sitelerinde çevrimiçi etkinlikleriniz hakkında belirli bilgileri toplamak ve kullanmak için çerezleri ve benzer izleme teknolojilerini kullanır (örneğin, reklamlarımızdan birine kaç kez tıkladığınız hakkında veri toplayarak). Bu bilgiler tek başına veya sizin hakkınızda diğer kaynaklardan (veri ortaklarımız gibi), iletişim bilgilerinizden ve Honeywell işlem geçmişinizden elde ettiğimiz bilgilerle birlikte, ilgi alanlarınızı ortaya çıkarmak ve tarama etkinliklerinizi ve çıkarılan ilgi alanlarınızı ("İlgi Alanına Dayalı Reklamcılık") temel alan size daha uygun hedefli reklamlar ve pazarlama sunmak için kullanılabilir. Bu tür İlgi Alanına Dayalı Reklamlar, yalnızca geçerli yasaların izin verdiği durumlarda ve reklamcılık/pazarlama tercihlerinize uygun olarak sunulacaktır. Diğer üçüncü taraf çerezlerinin ve teknolojilerinin bu Çerez Bildirimi tarafından kapsanmadığını; her bir şirketin özel gizlilik politikasına tabi olduğunu lütfen unutmayın.

**Cihazlar arası ve siteler arası izleme**

Biz, hizmet sağlayıcılarımız ve diğer üçüncü taraflar (Google ve diğer reklam ortakları gibi), sizin hakkınızda topladığımız bilgileri (doğrudan Sitelerimizden veya bir üçüncü taraftan), kullandığınız Cihazları tanımlayarak sizi çevrimiçi olarak tanımak amacıyla kullanabiliriz. Bu bilgileri, size birden çok farklı Cihazda ("cihazlar arası eşleştirme") ve sitelerde ("siteler arası izleme") [hedefli reklamlar](#targetedadvertising-turkish) sunmak için kullanırız. Cihazlar arası eşleştirme ve siteler arası izleme müşterimizin etkinliğini daha iyi anlamamıza, reklam kampanyalarını hedefleme ve ölçme yeteneğimizi geliştirmemize (bir kullanıcının bir reklamı görme sayısını sınırlamak dahil) olanak tanır. Ayrıca, devre dışı bırakılmış bir çereze bağlı olduğunu bildiğimiz tüm Cihazlarda devre dışı bırakma seçimlerinizi kolaylaştırabilmemiz için Cihazları eşleştirmemize yardımcı olur.

**Çerezleri ve İlgi Alanına Dayalı Reklamcılığı devre dışı bırakma**

Çerez alımı konusunda [Gizlilik Tercih Merkezimizi](#) kullanarak seçim yapabilirsiniz veya alternatif olarak tarayıcı ayarlarınız web sitesi çerezlerini silmenizi ve/veya devre dışı bırakmanızı sağlar. Çerezlerinizi web tarayıcınızda nasıl sileceğiniz hakkında daha fazla bilgi için tarayıcınızın talimatlarına bakın: [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en),  [Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies), [Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4468242/microsoft-edge-browsing-data-and-privacy), [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/clear-cookies-and-site-data-firefox), [Opera](https://help.opera.com/en/latest/web-preferences/#cookies), Safari ([Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac), [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265), [iPad](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265), or [iPod touch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265)).

Çerezleri devre dışı bırakmayı seçerseniz, Sitelerin aynı şekilde çalışmadığını görebilirsiniz. Bazı çerezler, sizinle iletişime geçilmemesine veya Cihazınıza başka türden çerezlerin eklenmemesine ilişkin yaptığınız seçimleri kaydetmek ve bu seçimlere uymak için gereklidir. Çerezleri bilgisayarınızdan silerseniz, İlgi Alanına Dayalı Reklamcılık dahil tercihlerinizi tanımak için kullanılan çerez de silinir ve seçimlerinizi tekrar yapmanız gerekir.

Kullanıcılar ayrıca aşağıdakiler gibi çeşitli ticaret derneği web sitelerini kullanarak üçüncü taraf reklam ağlarını devre dışı bırakabilir:

* Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) - [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/)
* Digital Advertising alliance (DAA) – (i) Genel: [https://optout.aboutads.info/](https://optout.aboutads.info/); (ii) Avrupa: [http://youronlinechoices.eu/](http://youronlinechoices.eu/)

İlgi Alanına Dayalı Reklamcılığı devre dışı bırakmak, bu şirketlerin size ilgi alanına dayalı içerik veya reklamlar sunmasını engelleyecektir, ancak bu işlem, web sitemiz veya diğer web siteleri aracılığıyla herhangi bir reklam almayacağınız anlamına gelmez. Honeywell reklamlarını görmeye devam edebilirsiniz, ancak bu reklamlar Honeywell veya ortaklarımız tarafından size göre özelleştirilmeyecektir. Herhangi bir zamanda kişisel bilgilerinizin üçüncü tarafların reklam göstermesine veya size gösterilen reklamları kişiselleştirmesine izin vermek için kullanılmasını istemiyorsanız, üçüncü taraflar tarafından sağlanan araçları kullanarak da ayarlarınızı değiştirebilirsiniz. Google, Facebook ve LinkedIn.

**Takip Edilmeme (Do Not Track, DNT)**

Bazı web tarayıcıları, iletişimde olduğunuz sitelere “do-not-track” (takip edilmeme) sinyalleri gönderebilir. Bu işlevin kapsanması ve etkinleştirilmesi açısından web tarayıcıları arasında bulunan farklar nedeniyle kullanıcıların bu sinyalin aktarılmasını isteyip istemedikleri ve hatta bu sinyallerin farkında olup olmadıkları her zaman açık değildir. Bu sinyallere göre hareket etmeyebiliriz. Bunun yanı sıra, belirli izleme faaliyetlerini devre dışı bırakabilirsiniz (örneğin çerezleri devre dışı bırakarak) ve ayrıca "[Çerezleri ve İlgi Alanına Dayalı Reklamcılığı devre dışı bırakma](#disablingcookies-turkish)" bölümündeki talimatları izleyerek hedefli reklamcılığı da devre dışı bırakabilirsiniz.

يصف إشعار ملفات تعريف الارتباط هذا كيف أن شركة Honeywell International Inc. والشركات التابعة لها (يُشار إليها إجمالًا باسم **Honeywellالخاص/ة بنا**، أو**نحن**) تستخدم ملفات تعريف الارتباط والتقنيات المشابهة المثبتة على أجهزة مثل الكمبيوتر، أو الهاتف المحمول، أو الجهاز اللوحي (**الأجهزة**) الخاصة بزائري -أو مستخدمي- موقعنا الإلكتروني، و/أو منتجاتنا، و/أو تطبيقاتنا (**المواقع**).

يمكن لملفات تعريف الارتباط والتقنيات المشابهة معالجة المعلومات الشخصية. يُرجى زيارة:

* · [بيان الخصوصية](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/privacy-statement#arabic) الخاص بنا إذا كنت ترغب في الحصول على مزيدٍ من المعلومات حول كيفية معالجتنا لمعلوماتك الشخصية، وكيفية ممارسة حقوق أصحاب البيانات لديك
* ·[مركز تفضيلات الخصوصية](#) الخاص بنا لمزيدٍ من المعلومات حول ملفات تعريف الارتباط المحددة التي نستخدمها على مواقعنا، ولإدارة تفضيلات ملفات تعريف الارتباط الخاصة بك.

**ما المقصود بملفات تعريف الارتباط؟**

ملفات تعريف الارتباط هي ملفات نصية صغيرة تضعها مواقعنا على أجهزتك. وعند زيارة مواقعنا مجددًا، تتصل تقنياتنا تلقائيًا بملف تعريف الارتباط للتعرف عليك أو على جهازك، وتستدعي المعلومات الخاصة بك، مثل معلومات تسجيل الدخول أو تفضيلات اللغة. كما نستخدم ملفات تعريف الارتباط التابعة لجهات خارجية. وهي ملفات تعريف ارتباط من مجالٍ مختلفٍ عن مجال موقع الويب الذي تزوره، والذي يسمح لنا، وللجهات الخارجية التي تمتلك ملفات تعريف الارتباط -وأحيانًا للمشاركين الآخرين في شبكات ملفات تعريف الارتباط- بالتعرف عليك أو على جهازك أثناء زيارتك لمواقع الويب المختلفة. ونحن نستخدم كلمة ملفات تعريف الارتباط لتضمين جزء من نص، أو وحدات بكسل، أو ملفات gif واضحة، أو ملفات سجلات، أو برامج ملحقة لتتبُّع الويب أو أي تقنية تتبُّع أخرى مماثلة يتم وضعها على أجهزتك.

**:وهناك أربعة أنواع من ملفات تعريف الارتباط التي يمكن أن نستخدمها**

**· ملفات تعريف الارتباط شديدة الأهمية** وتُعدّ ضروريةً لمواقعنا حتى تتمكن من العمل، ومن تزويدك بما طلبته من خدماتٍ ومعلومات. ويتم استثناء ملفات تعريف الارتباط شديدة الأهمية من شروط الموافقة.

* **ملفات تعريف الارتباط الوظيفية** تعمل على تمكين الوظائف المحسّنة والتخصيص. فهي -على سبيل المثال- تسمح لمواقعنا بتذكّر المعلومات التي تقدّمُها، مثل تفضيلات اللغة لديك، وتخزين المعلومات الفنية المفيدة لتفاعلاتك مع مواقعنا. وقد يتم تعيينها من قِبلنا أو من قِبل مزودي الجهات الخارجية الذين أضفنا خدماتهم إلى مواقعنا. وفي حال لم تسمح بملفات تعريف الارتباط هذه، فقد لا تعمل بعض هذه الخدمات أو كلّها بشكلٍ صحيحٍ.
* **ملفات تعريف الارتباط الخاصة بالأداء** تعمل على جمع معلوماتٍ حول استخدامك لمواقعنا (فهي تسمح لنا -على سبيل المثال- بإحصاء عدد الزيارات ومصادر حركة المرور)، كما تساعدنا في معرفة مستويات أداء مواقعنا حتى نتمكن من إجراء تحسيناتٍ ذات صلةٍ يمكنها أن تحسّن من تجربة التصفح لديك (فهي تُتيح لنا -على سبيل المثال- أن نتعرف على الصفحات الأكثر شيوعًا والصفحات الأقل شيوعًا). ويتم تجميع كل المعلومات التي تجمعها ملفات تعريف الارتباط هذه، لذلك تكون مجهولة المصدر.
* **ملفات تعريف الارتباط المخصصة للإعلان/الاستهداف** تجمع بياناتٍ حول نشاطك عبر الإنترنت وتحديد اهتماماتك؛ حتى نتمكن من إنشاء ملف تعريفٍ لك وتقديم إعلانات أكثر صلة بك. كما أنها تقوم بأداء وظائف أخرى مثل منع الظهور المستمر للإعلانات المكررة، والتأكّد من عرض الإعلانات بشكلٍ صحيح، واختيار الإعلانات المعتمدة على اهتماماتك.

لمزيدٍ من المعلومات حول ملفات تعريف الارتباط التي تستخدمها شركة Honeywell، يُرجى زيارة [مركز تفضيلات الخصوصية](#)**.**

**لمَ نستخدم ملفات تعريف الارتباط والتقنيات المماثلة الأخرى؟**

نستخدم ملفات تعريف الارتباط وتقنيات التتبُّع المماثلة الأخرى للأغراض التالية:

* تخزين التفضيلات والإعدادات الخاصة بك؛
* السماح لك بتسجيل الدخول والمصادقة عليك حتى تتمكن من الوصول إلى مواقعنا والتنقل داخلها من صفحة إلى أخرى؛
* تأمين مواقعنا بما يتضمّن الكشف عن حالات الاحتيال والوقاية منها؛
* تخصيص المعلومات المقدمة لك بناءً على تفضيلات التصفح الخاصة بك، مثل اللغة والمنطقة الجغرافية؛
* مراقبة أنماط حركة المستخدمين داخل مواقعنا وجمع الإحصائيات المتعلقة باستخدامك لموقع الويب؛ لمساعدتنا على فهم مستويات أداء مواقعنا وكيفية تحسينها لأغراضٍ مثل تعزيز تجربة التصفح الخاصة بك، وتقديم خدماتٍ أكثر صلة بك؛
* تزويدنا بالمعلومات التجارية والتسويقية؛
* تتبُّع المستخدمين الذين يزورون مواقعنا، وصفحات وسائل التواصل الاجتماعي الخاصة بنا، والإعلانات المعروضة عبر الإنترنت والاتصالات التسويقية، أو يتفاعلون معها، أو يستخدمونها (مثل الإعلانات التي يتم النقر عليها، أو مثل فتح المستخدم لرسالة بريد إلكتروني أرسلناها إليه، أو قيامه بإعادة توجيهها)؛ إلى جانب
* [الإعلانات المستهدفة](#targetedadvertisingarabic)؛ و
* [التتبُّع عبر الأجهزة وعبر المواقع](#crossdevicearabic).

**من يستخدم المعلومات المخزنة في ملفات تعريف الارتباط وتقنيات التتبّع المماثلة؟**

تُستخدم المعلومات المخزّنة في ملفات تعريف الارتباط الخاصة بمواقعنا بشكلٍ حصريٍّ من جِهتنا (أو من قِبل جهاتٍ خارجيةٍ تعمل بالنيابة عنا) -وهذا لا يتضمّن ملفات تعريف الارتباط الخاصة بالجهات الخارجية، والتي يتم استخدامها وإدارتها من قِبَل أطراف خارجية- وذلك لتوفير الخدمات المطلوبة من جانبنا؛ لتحسين خدماتنا وتحسين تجربتك عند التنقل في مواقعنا. لمزيدٍ من المعلومات حول ملفات تعريف الموقع الحالي وملفات تعريف الموقع غير المستخدم حاليًا، والتي تستخدمها شركة Honeywell، يُرجى زيارة [مركز تفضيلات الخصوصية](#) الخاص بنا**.**

**ماذا عن ملفات تعريف الارتباط (أو العناصر المحلية المشتركة) الخاصة بـ Flash؟**  
  
يمكن أن نستخدم ملفات تعريف الارتباط الخاصة بـ Flash أو العناصر المحلية المشتركة الخاصة بـ Flash (Flash LSOs) لتخزين تفضيلات موقع الويب لديك، وتخصيص زيارتك، والوقاية من محاولات الاحتيال، كما يمكن أن نستخدمها لعمليات الموقع الأخرى. وإذا كنت لا تريد تخزين العناصر المحلية المشتركة الخاصة بـ Flash Flash LSOs على جهاز الكمبيوتر الخاص بك، يمكنك ضبط إعدادات مُشغّل Flash لحظر تخزين عناصر Flash LSOs باستخدام الأدوات الموجودة في لوحة إعدادات تخزين موقع الويب. كما يمكنك التحكم في عناصر Flash LSOs بالانتقال إلى لوحة إعدادات التخزين العمومية واتباع التعليمات (والتي قد تتضمن تعليماتٍ تشرح -على سبيل المثال- كيفية حذف عناصر Flash LSOs الموجودة).

**الإعلانات المستهدفة**

نتتبّع كلًّا من الاستخدامات الفردية والمعلومات الإحصائية المجمّعة المتعلقة باستخدامك لمواقعنا ونحللها. كما نتشارك مع الجهات الخارجية (مثل المُعلِنين وشركاء الإعلانات) لعرض الإعلانات على مواقعنا وإدارتها على مواقع الجهات الخارجية الأخرى وعرضها عليها. تستخدم هذه الجهات الخارجية ملفات تعريف الارتباط وتقنيات التتبع المماثلة لجمع معلوماتٍ معينة حول أنشطتك عبر الإنترنت، واستخدامها إما على مواقعنا وإما على مواقع جهاتٍ خارجيةٍ أخرى؛ لقياس فعالية الإعلانات وأنشطتنا التسويقية عبر الإنترنت وتتبُّعها (على سبيل المثال: من خلال جمع البيانات المتعلّقة بعدد مرات النقر فوق أحد إعلاناتنا). كما يمكن استخدام هذه المعلومات منفردةً أو مع المعلومات المتعلقة بك -التي نحصل عليها من مصادر أخرى (مثل شركاء البيانات لدينا)- إلى جانب تفاصيل الاتصال الخاصة بك وسجل معاملات Honeywell لاستنتاج اهتماماتك وتقديم إعلاناتٍ مستهدفة، وحملات تسويقية مستهدفة تتناسب معك أكثر، وذلك بناءً على أنشطة التصفح والاهتمامات المستنتجة (الإعلانات القائمة على الاهتمامات). ولن يتم تقديم مثل هذه الإعلانات القائمة على الاهتمامات إلا في الحالات المسموح بها بموجب القانون المعمول به ووفقًا لتفضيلاتك الإعلانية/التسويقية. يُرجى ملاحظة أن ملفات تعريف الارتباط والتقنيات الخاصة بالجهات الخارجية الأخرى تحكمها سياسة الخصوصية الخاصة بكل شركة وأن هذا الإشعار ليس خاصًّا بملفات تعريف الارتباط.

**التتبُّع عبر الأجهزة وعبر المواقع**

يمكننا، كما يمكن لمقدمي خدماتنا والجهات الخارجية الأخرى -مثل Google وشركاء الإعلانات الآخرين- استخدام المعلومات التي نجمعها عنك -سواء أكان ذلك مباشرةً من مواقعنا أم من جهةٍ خارجية- لأغراض التعرّف عليك عبر الإنترنت من خلال تحديد الأجهزة التي تستعملها. ونحن نستخدم هذه المعلومات لتقديم إعلانات تستهدفك عبر العديد من الأجهزة المختلفة ("المطابقة عبر الأجهزة") والمواقع المختلفة ("التتبُّع عبر المواقع"). تُمكّننا المطابقة عبر الأجهزة والتتبع عبر المواقعمن فهم نشاط عملائنا بشكلٍ أفضل، وتحسين قدرتنا على استهدافهم بالحملات الإعلانية وقياسها (وهذا يتضمن تقييد عدد المرات التي يرى فيها المستخدم أحد الإعلانات). كما تساعدنا في مطابقة الأجهزة لنتمكن من تسهيل اختيارات إلغاء الاشتراك عبر جميع الأجهزة التي نعرف أنها متصلة بملف تعريف ارتباط إلغاء الاشتراك.

**تعطيل ملفات تعريف الارتباط وإلغاء الاشتراك في الإعلانات القائمة على الاهتمامات**

يمكنك تحديد اختياراتك بشأن استلام ملفات تعريف الارتباط باستخدام [مركز تفضيلات الخصوصية](#) الخاص بنا، أو -بدلًا من ذلك- يجب أن تسمح لك إعدادات المتصفح الخاص بك بحذف و/أو تعطيل ملفات تعريف الارتباط الخاصة بموقع الويب. لمزيد من المعلومات حول كيفية حذف ملفات تعريف الارتباط في متصفح الويب الخاص بك، راجع إرشادات المتصفح الخاص بك: [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en)، أو [Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies)، أو [Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4468242/microsoft-edge-browsing-data-and-privacy)، أو [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/clear-cookies-and-site-data-firefox)، أو [Opera، أو](https://help.opera.com/en/latest/web-preferences/#cookies) Safari ([Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac)، أو [iPhone، أو iPad، أو iPod touch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265)).

إذا اخترت تعطيل ملفات تعريف الارتباط، فقد تجد أن المواقع لم تعد تعمل بالطريقة نفسها. بعض ملفات تعريف الارتباط ضرورية لتسجيل الخيارات التي حددتها ومراعاتها فيما يتعلق بعدم الاتصال أو عدم إضافة أنواع أخرى من ملفات تعريف الارتباط إلى جهازك. وإذا قمت بحذف ملفات تعريف الارتباط من جهاز الكمبيوتر الخاص بك، فسيتم كذلك حذف ملف تعريف الارتباط المستخدم للتعرّف على تفضيلاتك، بما في ذلك الإعلانات القائمة على الاهتمامات، وهذا يستدعي منك تحديد اختياراتك مرةً أخرى.

كما يمكن للمستخدمين إلغاء الاشتراك في شبكات الإعلانات التابعة لجهاتٍ خارجيةٍ من خلال استخدام مواقع الويب الخاصة بالاتحادات التجارية المختلفة مثل:

* مبادرة إعلان شبكة الاتصال (NAI) - [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/)
* تحالف الإعلان الرقمي (DAA) - (1) عالمي: [https://optout.aboutads.info](https://optout.aboutads.info/) ؛ (2) أوروبا: [http://youronlinechoices.eu](http://youronlinechoices.eu/)

سيؤدي إلغاء الاشتراك في الإعلانات القائمة على الاهتمامات إلى إلغاء اشتراكك فيما تقدّمه هذه الشركات من محتوى أو إعلاناتٍ قائمة على الاهتمامات، ولكن لا يعني هذا أنك لن تتلقى أي إعلانات من خلال موقعنا الإلكتروني أو من خلال مواقع الويب الأخرى. قد تظل إعلانات Honeywell تظهر لك ولكن لن يتم تخصيص هذه الإعلانات لك من جانبنا في Honeywell ولا من جانب شركائنا. إذا كنت ترغب بأي وقت في عدم السماح للجهات الخارجية باستخدام معلوماتك الشخصية مُطلقًا بما يُمكِّنها من تشغيل الإعلانات المعروضة لك أو تخصيصها، يمكنك كذلك ضبط إعداداتك باستخدام الأدوات التي توفرها جهات خارجية مثل: Google، و Facebook، و LinkedIn.

**عدم التتبُّع (DNT)**

قد ترسل بعض متصفحات الويب إشارات عدم التتبُّع إلى المواقع التي تستخدمها. ونظرًا إلى الاختلافات في كيفية دمج متصفحات الويب لهذه الميزة وتفعيلها، فليس من الواضح دومًا ما إذا كان المستخدمون يخططون لإرسال هذه الإشارات، أو ما إذا كانوا على علمٍ بها أو لا. يمكننا ألا نستجيب لهذه الإشارات. كما يمكنك تعطيل تتبُّع معين (من خلال تعطيل ملفات تعريف الارتباط مثلًا)، ويمكنك كذلك إلغاء الاشتراك في [الإعلانات المستهدفة](#targetedadvertisingarabic) باتباع التعليمات الواردة في قسم [تعطيل ملفات تعريف الارتباط وإلغاء الاشتراك في الإعلانات القائمة على الاهتمامات](#disablingcookiesarabic)

**定向广告宣传**

我们跟踪和分析与您对我们站点的使用相关的个性化使用情况和汇总统计信息。 我们还与第三方（如广告商和广告合作伙伴）合作，在我们站点上展示广告，并在其他第三方站点上管理和提供广告宣传。 这些第三方使用 Cookie 和类似的跟踪技术来收集和使用有关您在我们站点或其他第三方站点上的在线活动的某些信息，从而衡量和跟踪广告和我们在线营销活动的有效性（例如，收集您点击我们某一广告的次数）。 这些信息可以单独使用，也可以与我们从其他来源（如我们的数据合作伙伴）、您的详细联系方式和 Honeywell 交易历史纪录中获得的有关您的信息结合使用，以便推断您的兴趣并根据您的浏览活动和推断的兴趣为您提供更有针对性的[定向广告](#targetedadvertisingchinese)和营销（“基于兴趣的广告”）。 此类基于兴趣的广告只会在适用法律允许且符合您的广告/营销偏好的情况下投放。 请注意，其他第三方的 Cookie 和技术受各家公司自身的隐私政策而非本 Cookie 声明的约束。

**跨设备和跨网站跟踪**

我们、我们的服务提供商和其他第三方（例如 Google 和其他广告合作伙伴）可能会使用我们收集的有关您的信息（无论是直接从我们的站点还是从第三方获取），以便通过识别您使用的设备来在线识别您。 我们使用该信息跨多个不同设备（“跨设备匹配”）和网站（“跨网站跟踪”）为您提供 [定向广告](#targetedadvertisingchinese)宣传。 跨设备匹配和跨网站跟踪让我们能够更好地了解客户的活动，提高我们定位和衡量广告活动的能力（包括限制用户看到广告的次数）。 它还可以帮助我们匹配设备，以便在您选择禁用某个 Cookie 时，在您的所有设备上均予以禁用。

**禁用 Cookie 并拒收基于兴趣的广告宣传**

您可以使用我们的[隐私偏好中心](#)来选择接收 Cookie，或者借助您的浏览器设置来删除和/或禁用网站 Cookie。 有关如何在网络浏览器中删除 Cookie 的更多信息，请参阅浏览器的说明。这些浏览器包括 [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en)、[Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies)、[Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4468242/microsoft-edge-browsing-data-and-privacy)、[Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/clear-cookies-and-site-data-firefox)、[Opera、](https://help.opera.com/en/latest/web-preferences/#cookies)Safari（[Mac、](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac)[iPhone、iPad 或 iPod Touch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265)）。

如果您选择禁用 Cookie，您可能会发现站点的工作方式发生改变。 有些 Cookie 是必要的，它们可记录您对是否接受联系或是否将其他类型的 Cookie 添加到设备的选择，并在日后予以执行。 如果您从计算机中删除 Cookie，用于识别您的偏好（包括基于兴趣的广告宣传）的 Cookie 也将被删除，需要您重新进行选择。

用户还可以使用各种行业协会网站选择退出第三方广告网络，例如：

* 网络广告倡议 (NAI)—[http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/)
* 数字广告联盟 (DAA) - (i) 全球： [https://optout.aboutads.info/](https://optout.aboutads.info/)；(ii) 欧洲： [http://youronlinechoices.eu/](http://youronlinechoices.eu/)

选择退出基于兴趣的广告宣传将使您拒绝这些公司向您提供基于兴趣的内容或广告，但并不意味着您将不再通过我们的网站或其他网站收到任何广告。 您可能仍会看到 Honeywell 广告，但 Honeywell 或我们的合作伙伴不会为您定制这些广告。 在任何时候，如果您不希望您的个人信息被第三方用于展示广告或对展示给您的广告进行个性化定制，您也可以使用第三方提供的工具调整您的设置，例如： Google、Facebook 和 LinkedIn。

**请勿跟踪 (DNT)**

有些 Web 浏览器可能会向您访问的站点传送“禁止跟踪”信号。 由于 Web 浏览器合入和激活此功能的方式不同，因此我们并非总能确定用户是否希望传送这种信号或者是否知道这种信号的存在。 我们可能不会针对这些信号采取任何措施。 您还可以禁用某些跟踪功能（例如通过禁用 Cookie），并且您还可以按照“[禁用 Cookie 并拒收基于兴趣的广告宣传](#disablingcookieschinese)“部分中的说明选择拒收定向广告宣传。

Denne cookieerklæring beskriver, hvordan Honeywell International Inc. og dets datterselskaber (samlet **"Honeywell"**, **"os"** eller **"vi"**) bruger cookies og lignende teknologier, der installeres på enheder som f.eks. en computer, mobilenhed eller tablet (**"Enheder"**) fra besøgende på, eller brugere af, vores hjemmeside, produkter og/eller applikationer (**"Sider"**).

Cookies og lignende teknologier kan behandle personlige oplysninger. Besøg venligst:

* vores [databeskyttelseserklæring](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/privacy-statement#danish), hvis du vil have flere oplysninger om, hvordan vi behandler dine personoplysninger, og hvordan du gør brug af dine rettigheder som registreret
* vores [indstillingscenter for databeskyttelse](#) for flere oplysninger om de specifikke cookies, vi bruger på vores sider, og for at administrere dine cookieindstillinger.

**Hvad er cookies?**

Cookies er små tekstfiler, som vores sider gemmer på dine enheder. Når du besøger vores sider flere gange, opretter vores teknologier automatisk forbindelse til cookien for at identificere dig eller din enhed og huske oplysninger om dig, såsom dine sprogpræferencer eller loginoplysninger. Vi bruger også tredjepartscookies, som er cookies fra et andet domæne end domænet på den hjemmeside, du besøger, som giver os, den tredjepart, der ejer de pågældende cookies og i nogle tilfælde andre deltagere i cookienetværket, mulighed for at identificere dig eller din enhed, når du besøger forskellige hjemmesider. Vi bruger ordet »cookies«, når vi taler om et stykke tekst, pixels, gennemsigtige gifs, logfiler, web beacons eller anden lignende sporingsteknologi, der gemmes på dine enheder.

**Der er fire cookietyper, som vi kan bruge:**

* **Strengt nødvendige cookies** er nødvendige for at vores sider kan fungere og levere de tjenester og oplysninger, du har anmodet om, til dig. Strengt nødvendige cookies er undtaget fra kravet om samtykke.
* **Funktionelle cookies** muliggør forbedret funktionalitet og tilpasning. Disse giver for eksempel vores sider mulighed for at huske oplysninger, som du angiver, f.eks. dine sprogindstillinger, og gemme tekniske oplysninger, der er nyttige for dine interaktioner med vores sider. De kan indstilles af os eller af tredjepartsudbydere, hvis tjenester vi har tilføjet til vores sider.  Hvis du ikke tillader disse cookies, vil nogle eller alle disse tjenester muligvis ikke fungere korrekt.
* **Præstationscookies** indsamler oplysninger om din brug af vores sider (f.eks. giver de os mulighed for at tælle antal besøg og trafikkilder) og hjælper os med at finde ud af, hvordan vores sider klarer sig, så vi kan foretage relevante forbedringer, der kan forbedre din browseroplevelse (f.eks. giver de os mulighed for at se, hvilke sider der er de mest og mindst populære). Alle oplysninger, som disse cookies indsamler, er aggregerede og derfor anonyme.
* **Annoncerings-/målretningscookies** indsamler data om din onlineaktivitet og identificerer dine interesser, så vi kan oprette en profil om dig og levere annoncer, der er mere relevante for dig. De udfører også funktioner, som eksempelvis at forhindre de samme annoncer i løbende at blive vist igen, sikre, at annoncer vises korrekt, og vælge annoncer, der er baseret på dine interesser.

Du kan få flere oplysninger om de cookies, Honeywell bruger, ved at besøge vores [indstillingscenter for databeskyttelse](#).

**Hvorfor bruger vi cookies og andre lignende teknologier?**

Vi bruger cookies og andre lignende sporingsteknologier til følgende formål:

* At gemme dine præferencer og indstillinger;
* At give dig mulighed for at logge ind og godkende dig, så du kan tilgå vores sider, og gå fra webside til webside inden for vores sider;

**Päivitetty: 11. kesäkuuta 2021**

Tässä Evästeilmoituksessa kuvataan, miten Honeywell International Inc. ja sen tytäryhtiöt (yhdessä ”**Honeywell**” tai ”**me**”) käyttää kävijöiden tai käyttäjien tietokoneeseen, mobiililaitteeseen tai tablettiin (”**Laitteet**”) asennettuja evästeitä tai vastaavia teknologioita sivustollamme tai tuotteissamme ja/tai sovelluksissamme (”**Sivustot**”).

Evästeet ja vastaavat teknologiat voivat käsitellä henkilötietoja. Lue lisää:

* [Tietosuojalausunto](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/privacy-statement#finnish), josta saat lisätietoja henkilötietojesi käsittelystä ja rekisteröidyn oikeuksiesi käytöstä
* [Tietosuojakeskuksessa](#), jos haluat lisätietoja Sivustoillamme käytetyistä evästeistä tai tehdä muutoksia evästeasetuksiisi.

**Mitä evästeet ovat?**

Evästeet ovat pieniä tekstitiedostoja, joita Sivustomme sijoittavat Laitteisiisi. Kun tulet Sivustoillemme uudelleen, teknologiamme havaitsee evästeen ja tunnistaa sinut tai laitteesi ja muistaa tietoja sinusta, kuten kieliasetuksesi tai kirjautumistietosi. Käytämme myös kolmannen osapuolen evästeitä, joiden verkkotunnus poikkeaa omastamme. Nämä evästeet sallivat meidän, kyseisen kolmannen osapuolen ja joissakin tapauksissa muidenkin yhteisen evästeverkoston jäsenten tunnistaa sinut tai Laitteesi, kun käyt eri sivustoilla. Termi ”Evästeet” käsittää teksti-, pikseli-, gif- ja lokitiedostot, verkkomajakat ja muut seurantatekniikat, joita sijoitetaan Laitteisiisi.

**Käytössämme voi olla neljä evästetyyppiä:**

* **Välttämättömiä evästeitä** tarvitaan, jotta Sivustomme toimisivat ja voisivat tarjota sinulle pyytämiäsi palveluita ja tietoja. Välttämättömien evästeiden käyttöön ei vaadita palvelun käyttäjän suostumusta.
* **Toiminnalliset evästeet** mahdollistavat parannellun toiminnot ja personoinnin. Ne sallivat Sivustojemme esimerkiksi muistaa antamiasi tietoja, kuten kielivalinnan, ja tallentaa teknisiä tietoja, joista on hyötyä käyttäessäsi Sivustoja. Ne ovat joko meidän tai meille palveluita tuottavan kolmannen osapuolen asettamia. Jos et salli näitä evästeitä, jotkin tai kaikki näistä palveluista eivät ehkä toimi oikein.
* **Suorituskykyevästeet** keräävät tietoja Sivustojen käytöstäsi (esimerkiksi laskevat käyntejä ja tuloreittejä) ja antavat meille Sivustojen toiminnasta tietoa, jonka pohjalta voimme parantaa selailukokemustasi (esimerkiksi antamalla tietoa suosituimmista ja vähiten suosituista sivuistamme). Kaikki näiden evästeiden keräämä tieto tulee meille anonyymeina koosteina.
* **Mainonta-/kohdennusevästeet** keräävät tietoja aktiivisuudestasi verkossa. Ne tunnistavat kiinnostuksen kohteesi, jotta voimme luoda sinulle profiilin ja näyttää sopivampia mainoksia. Niiden toimintoihin kuuluu myös esimerkiksi saman mainoksen jatkuvan näytön estäminen, ilmoitusten oikein näkymisestä huolehtiminen sekä kiinnostuksen kohteisiisi perustuvien mainosten valinta.

Lisätietoja Honeywellin käyttämistä evästeistä löydät [Tietosuojakeskuksesta.](#)

**Miksi käytämme evästeitä ja vastaavia teknologioita?**

Evästeillä ja vastaavilla seurantateknologioilla on seuraavia tehtäviä:

* Asetustesi tallessapito
* Ne sallivat sisäänkirjautumisen ja tunnistautumisen, jotta pääset käyttämään Sivustoja ja siirtymään sivulta toiselle
* Ne suojaavat Sivustojamme muun muassa petosyrityksiltä
* Ne räätälöivät sinulle näytettävän informaation selainasetusten, kuten kielen ja sijainnin, perusteella
* Ne seuraavat käyttäjien liikkumista Sivustoilla ja keräävät tilastotietoa Sivuston käytöstäsi. Näin ymmärrämme paremmin Sivustomme suoriutumista ja saamme parannusideoita, joilla voimme esimerkiksi sujuvoittaa selailua ja tarjota sinulle relevantimpia palveluita.
* Ne tarjoavat meille informaatiota yritystoimintaan ja markkinointiin
* Ne seuraavat kävijöitä Sivustoillamme, sosiaalisen median sivuillamme, verkkomainoksissamme ja markkinointiviesteissämme sekä näissä tapahtuvaa vuorovaikutusta (esimerkiksi mitä mainoksia klikataan, tai onko käyttäjä avannut tai lähettänyt edelleen lähettämämme sähköpostin)
* [Kohdennettu mainonta](#targetedadvertising-finnish)
* [Seuranta yli laite- ja sivustorajojen](#crossdevice-finnish)

**Kuka käyttää evästeiden ja vastaavien seurantateknologioiden keräämää tietoa?**

Sivustojemme evästeisiin tallennettuja tietoja käytämme yksinomaan me itse (tai toimeksiannolla toimivat kolmannet osapuolet). Poikkeus tähän ovat kolmansien osapuolten evästeet, joita käyttävät ja hallinnoivat ulkopuoliset tahot, jotka ovat saaneet meiltä toimeksiannon parantaa palveluitamme ja navigointikokemustasi. Lisätietoja Honeywellin käyttämistä omista ja kolmannen osapuolen evästeistä on löydät [Tietosuojakeskuksestamme.](#)

**Entä Flash-evästeet (Local Shared Objects)?**  
  
Flash-evästeillä (Flash LSO) voimme tallentaa sivustomieltymyksesi, personoida sivustokäyntisi, estää petoksia ja toteuttaa muita sivustotoimintoja. Jos et halua, että laitteellesi tallennetaan Flash-evästeitä, voit käydä Flash Playerin asetuksissa estämässä niiden tallennuksen sivustotallennusasetusten paneelissa. Voit hallita Flash-LSO:ita myös laitteen tallennusasetuksissa seuraamalla ohjeita (niissä voidaan esimerkiksi neuvoa, miten poistat koneella jo olevat Flash LSO:t).

**Kohdennettu mainonta**

Seuraamme ja analysoimme Sivustojemme käytöstä kertovaa yksilöllistä dataa sekä koontitilastoja. Hyödynnämme myös ulkopuolisia kumppaneita (kuten mainostajia ja mainosalustoja) näyttääksemme Sivustoillamme muiden mainoksia ja omia mainoksiamme muiden sivustoilla. Nämä tahot käyttävät evästeitä ja vastaavia seurantateknologioita informaation keruuseen ja käyttöön verkkotoiminnastasi joko meidän Sivustoillamme tai muilla sivustoilla. Näin he mittaavat ja seuraavat mainonnan ja verkkomarkkinointimme tehoa (esimerkiksi laskemalla, montako kertaa klikkaat mainosta). Näitä tietoja voidaan hyödyntää sellaisenaan tai yhdessä muista lähteistä (kuten datakumppaneilta) saamiemme tietojen, yhteystietojesi ja Honeywell-tapahtumahistoriasi kanssa. Tältä pohjalta tarjotaan juuri sinulle verkkoselailuusi ja pääteltyihin kiinnostuksen kohteisiisi perustuvaa mainontaa ja markkinointia (räätälöityä mainontaa). Saat räätälöityjä mainoksia vain, jos sovellettava laki sen sallii ja olet antanut siihen luvan mainonta-/markkinointiasetuksissasi. Huomaa, että muiden kolmansien osapuolten evästeitä ja teknologioita säätelevät kunkin yrityksen oma tietosuojakäytäntö, ei tämä evästeilmoitus.

**Seuranta yli laite- ja sivustorajojen**

Me, palveluntuottajamme ja muut kolmannet osapuolet (kuten Google ja muut mainoskumppanit) voivat käyttää sinusta (joko Sivustollamme tai kolmannen osapuolen kautta) kerättyä informaatiota sinun tunnistamiseesi verkossa identifioimalla käyttämäsi Laitteet. Käytämme tätä informaatiota [kohdennettuun mainontaan](#targetedadvertising-finnish) useilla eri Laitteilla (seuranta yli laiterajojen) ja sivustoilla (seuranta yli sivustorajojen). Seuranta yli laiterajojen ja seuranta yli sivustorajojen antavat meille tilaisuuden ymmärtää paremmin asiakkaan toimintaa, kohdistaa viestit paremmin ja mitata mainoskampanjoita (sekä rajoittaa käyttäjäkohtaisia näyttökertoja). Se auttaa meitä myös tietämään, milloin Laitteet kuuluvat samalle käyttäjälle. Tällöin yhdellä laitteella oleva kieltoeväste tehoaa käyttäjän kaikissa Laitteissa.

**Evästeiden esto ja räätälöidyn mainonnan kielto**

Voit itse valita [Tietosuojakeskuksessamme](#) tai selaimesi asetuksissa, mitä evästeitä haluat sallia Laitteelle ja haluatko poistaa sivustoevästeitä. Lisätietoja evästeiden poistosta selaimen asetuksista löydät selainkohtaisista ohjeista: [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en), [Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies), [Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4468242/microsoft-edge-browsing-data-and-privacy), [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/clear-cookies-and-site-data-firefox), [Opera,](https://help.opera.com/en/latest/web-preferences/#cookies) Safari ([Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac), [iPhone, iPad tai iPod touch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265)).

Jos päätät estää evästeet, saatat huomata, että Sivustot eivät välttämättä toimi samalla tavalla. Jotkin evästeet ovat tarpeen, jotta tekemäsi valinnat tallentuvat: esimerkiksi yhteydenottokielto tai muiden evästetyyppien Laitteelle lisäämisen kielto. Jos poistat evästeet tietokoneelta, myös eväste, johon toiveesi mm. räätälöidyn mainonnan suhteen on tallennettu, poistetaan. Tällöin joudut tekemään samat valinnat uudelleen.

Käyttäjät voivat kieltää kolmansien osapuolten mainosverkostojen mainonnasta myös toimialajärjestöjen sivustoja hyödyntäen:

* Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) - [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/)
* Digital Advertising alliance (DAA) – (i) Globaalisti: [https://optout.aboutads.info/](https://optout.aboutads.info/); (ii) Euroopassa: [http://youronlinechoices.eu/](http://youronlinechoices.eu/)

Räätälöidyn mainonnan kielto estää näitä yrityksiä tarjoamasta sinulle kiinnostuksen kohteisiisi perustuvaa sisältöä tai mainoksia. Se ei kuitenkaan tarkoita, ettet enää näkisi mainontaa Sivustollamme tai muilla sivustoilla. Saatat edelleen nähdä Honeywellin mainoksia, mutta Honeywell tai kumppanimme eivät räätälöi niitä sinulle. Jos et halua henkilötietojasi käytettävän kolmansien osapuolten mainonnan sallimiseen tai näkemiesi mainosten personointiin, voit muuttaa asetuksiasi myös mm. seuraavissa palveluissa: Google, Facebook ja LinkedIn.

**Do Not Track (DNT)**

Joillakin verkkoselaimilla on valmius lähettää ”do-not-track”-signaali Sivustoille, joilla käyt. Koska eri selaimet toteuttavat ja aktivoivat tämän toiminnon eri tavoin, ei ole aina selvää, onko käyttäjä lähettänyt signaalin tietoisesti tai onko hän edes niistä tietoinen Emme välttämättä noudata näiden signaalien kehotusta. Voit myös estää tietyn seurantametodin (esimerkiksi evästeet) ja voit myös kieltäytyä kohdennetusta mainonnasta seuraamalla kohdan [Evästeiden esto ja räätälöidyn markkinoinnin kielto](#disablingcookies-finnish) ohjeita.

Mikäli sinulla on kysyttävää evästeiden käytöstämme, voit ottaa meihin yhteyttä kirjoittamalla osoitteeseen [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com).

Vous verrez peut-être encore des publicités Honeywell, mais celles-ci ne seront pas personnalisées pour vous par Honeywell ou nos partenaires. Si, à tout moment, vous ne souhaitez pas que vos informations personnelles soient utilisées pour permettre à des tiers d’afficher des publicités ou de personnaliser les publicités que vous voyez, vous pouvez également ajuster vos paramètres en utilisant les outils fournis par des tiers tels que Google, Facebook et LinkedIn.

**Ne pas suivre (DNT)**

Certains navigateurs Web peuvent transmettre des signaux «ne pas suivre» aux Sites avec lesquels vous communiquez. En raison des différences dans la façon dont les navigateurs Web intègrent et activent cette fonction, il n’est pas toujours possible de savoir si les utilisateurs ont l’intention de transmettre ces signaux ou s’ils en connaissent même l’existence. Nous ne pouvons pas agir en réponse à ces signaux. Vous pouvez également désactiver certains suivis (par exemple en désactivant des Cookies) ainsi que les publicités ciblées en suivant les instructions de la section [Désactivation des Cookies et des Publicités ciblées par centre d’intérêt](#disablingcookies-french)

Pour toute question sur notre utilisation des Cookies, veuillez nous contacter à l’adresse: [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com.).

**Mis à jour: 11 juin 2021**

Le présent Avis relatif aux témoins décrit la façon dont Honeywell International Inc. et ses sociétés affiliées (collectivement "**Honeywell"**, "**nous"**) utilisent les témoins et des technologies similaires installés sur les appareils, par exemple les ordinateurs, appareils mobiles ou tablettes ("**Appareils"**) des visiteurs ou des utilisateurs de notre site Web, de nos produits ou de nos applications ("**Sites"**).

Les témoins et technologies similaires peuvent traiter des renseignements personnels. Veuillez visiter:

* notre [Déclaration de confidentialité](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/privacy-statement#french-canadian) si vous souhaitez obtenir plus d’information sur la façon dont nous traitons vos renseignements personnels et afin de savoir comment exercer vos droits en tant que personne concernée.
* notre [Centre de préférences en matière de confidentialité](#) pour plus d’information sur les témoins précis que nous utilisons sur nos Sites et pour gérer vos préférences en matière de témoins.

**Que sont les témoins?**

Les témoins sont de petits fichiers texte que nos Sites placent sur vos Appareils. Lorsque vous visitez à nouveau nos Sites, nos technologies se connectent automatiquement aux témoins afin de vous identifier ou d’identifier votre Appareil et de se souvenir des informations vous concernant, par exemple vos préférences linguistiques ou vos informations de connexion. Nous utilisons également des témoins tiers, qui sont des témoins d’un domaine différent de celui du site Web que vous visitez et qui nous permettent, ainsi qu’au tiers propriétaire des témoins et, dans certains cas, à d’autres participants des réseaux de témoins, de vous identifier ou d’identifier votre Appareil lorsque vous visitez différents sites Web. Nous utilisons le terme «témoin» pour inclure un morceau de texte, des pixels, des GIF invisibles, des fichiers journaux, des balises Web ou d’autres technologies de suivi similaires qui sont placés sur vos Appareils.

**Nous pourrions utiliser quatre types de témoins:**

* **Les témoins strictement nécessaires** sont indispensables au fonctionnement de nos Sites et pour vous fournir les services et informations que vous avez demandés. Les témoins strictement nécessaires ne sont pas soumis à l’obligation de consentement.
* **Les témoins fonctionnels** permettent d’améliorer la fonctionnalité et la personnalisation. Par exemple, ces témoins permettent à nos sites de se rappeler certains renseignements que vous fournissez, comme vos préférences linguistiques, de même que des données techniques utiles pour l’utilisation de nos sites. Ils peuvent être définis par nos soins ou par des fournisseurs tiers dont nous avons ajouté les services sur nos Sites. Si vous n’autorisez pas ces témoins, il est possible que certains services ou même tous les services ne fonctionnent pas correctement.
* **Les témoins de performance** collectent des informations sur votre utilisation de nos Sites (par exemple, ils nous permettent de compter les visites et les sources de trafic) et nous aident à évaluer le rendement de nos Sites afin que nous puissions apporter des améliorations pertinentes susceptibles d’améliorer votre expérience de navigation (par exemple, cela nous permet de savoir quelles pages sont les plus et les moins populaires). Toutes les informations que ces témoins collectent sont regroupées et donc anonymes.
* **Les témoins publicitaires/de ciblage** collectent des données sur votre activité en ligne et déterminent vos intérêts afin que nous puissions créer un profil vous concernant et proposer des publicités plus pertinentes en fonction de celui-ci. Ils permettent également d’éviter que les mêmes publicités s’affichent continuellement, de s’assurer que les publicités sont affichées correctement et de sélectionner des publicités en fonction de vos intérêts.

Pour plus d’informations sur les témoins utilisés par Honeywell, veuillez consulter notre [Centre de préférences en matière de confidentialité](#)

**Pourquoi utilisons-nous des témoins et d’autres technologies similaires?**

Nous utilisons des témoins et d’autres technologies de suivi similaires aux fins suivantes:

* Stocker vos préférences et paramètres;
* Vous permettre de vous connecter et de vous authentifier afin que vous puissiez accéder à nos Sites et vous déplacer d’une page à l’autre au sein de nos Sites;
* Sécuriser nos Sites, y compris la détection et la prévention de la fraude;
* Personnaliser les informations qui vous sont présentées en fonction de vos préférences de navigation, comme la langue et la région géographique;
* Surveiller les habitudes de consultation des utilisateurs sur nos Sites et collecter des statistiques concernant votre utilisation du site Web pour nous aider à comprendre l’efficacité de nos Sites et les manières dont nous pouvons les améliorer à des fins telles que l’enrichissement de votre expérience de navigation et l’offre de services plus pertinents pour vous;
* Nous fournir des informations commerciales et marketing;
* Suivre les utilisateurs qui visitent nos Sites et nos pages de réseaux sociaux ou interagissent avec nos publicités en ligne et communications marketing (p. ex. les publicités sur lesquelles on a cliqué ou l’ouverture ou le transfert d’un courriel que nous avons envoyé à l’utilisateur);
* [Utiliser des publicités ciblées](#targetedadvertising-frenchca);
* [Suivre plusieurs appareils et sites](#crossdevice-frenchca).

**Qui utilise les informations stockées dans les témoins et les technologies de suivi similaires?**

Les informations stockées dans les témoins de nos Sites sont utilisées exclusivement par nous (ou par des tiers agissant en notre nom), à l’exception des témoins tiers qui sont utilisés et gérés par des tiers afin de fournir les services que nous demandons pour améliorer nos services et votre expérience lors de la navigation sur nos Sites. Pour de plus amples informations sur les témoins propriétaires et tiers utilisés par Honeywell, veuillez visiter notre [Centre de préférences en matière de confidentialité](#)

**Qu’en est-il des témoins ou des objets locaux partagés Flash?**  
  
Nous pouvons être amenés à utiliser des témoins ou des objets locaux partagés Flash (OLP Flash) pour stocker les préférences de votre site Web, personnaliser votre visite, prévenir la fraude et pour d’autres opérations du Site. Si vous ne souhaitez pas que des OLP Flash soient stockés sur votre ordinateur, vous pouvez modifier les paramètres de votre lecteur Flash de façon à bloquer le stockage des OLP Flash à l’aide des outils contenus dans le panneau des paramètres de stockage du site Web. Vous pouvez également contrôler les OLP Flash en accédant au panneau des paramètres de stockage globaux et en suivant les instructions (notamment celles expliquant comment supprimer les OLP Flash existants).

**Publicité ciblée**

Nous suivons et analysons à la fois l’utilisation individualisée et les informations statistiques agrégées liées à votre utilisation de nos Sites. Nous travaillons également en partenariat avec des tiers (comme des annonceurs et des partenaires publicitaires) pour afficher de la publicité sur nos Sites, ainsi que gérer et diffuser de la publicité sur d’autres sites tiers. Ces tiers utilisent des témoins et des technologies de suivi similaires pour collecter et utiliser certaines informations sur vos activités en ligne, que ce soit sur nos Sites ou sur d’autres sites tiers afin de mesurer et de suivre l’efficacité des publicités et de nos activités de marketing en ligne (par exemple, en collectant des données sur le nombre de fois où vous cliquez sur l’une de nos publicités). Ces informations peuvent être utilisées seules ou en combinaison avec des informations vous concernant que nous obtenons auprès d’autres sources (comme nos partenaires de données), vos coordonnées et l’historique des transactions Honeywell pour déduire vos intérêts et vous proposer des publicités et un marketing ciblés plus adaptés à vous en fonction de vos activités de navigation et de vos intérêts déduits («Publicités ciblées par centre d’intérêt»). Ces Publicités ciblées par centre d’intérêt ne seront diffusées que lorsque la loi applicable le permet et conformément à vos préférences en matière de publicité et de marketing. Veuillez noter que les témoins et les technologies d’autres tiers sont régis par la politique de confidentialité spécifique de chaque société et non par le présent Avis relatif aux témoins.

**Suivi de plusieurs appareils et sites**

Nous, nos fournisseurs de services et d’autres tiers (tels que Google et d’autres partenaires publicitaires) pouvons utiliser les informations que nous recueillons à votre sujet (que ce soit directement à partir de nos Sites ou auprès d’un tiers) dans le but de vous reconnaître en ligne en déterminant les Appareils que vous utilisez. Nous utilisons ces informations pour vous proposer des [publicités ciblées](#targetedadvertising-frenchca) sur plusieurs Appareils et sites différents (correspondance entre appareils) et sites (suivi intersite). La correspondance entre appareils et le suivi intersite nous permettent de mieux comprendre l’activité de nos clients, d’améliorer notre capacité à cibler et à mesurer les campagnes publicitaires (y compris en limitant le nombre de fois où un utilisateur voit une publicité). Cela nous aide également à faire correspondre les Appareils afin de pouvoir faciliter vos choix de désinscription sur tous les Appareils dont nous savons qu’ils sont connectés à un témoin de désactivation.

**Désactivation des témoins et des Publicités ciblées par centre d’intérêt**

Vous pouvez faire des choix concernant la réception de témoins en utilisant notre [Centre de préférences en matière de confidentialité](#) ou en vous servant des paramètres de votre navigateur qui doivent vous permettre de supprimer ou de désactiver les témoins de sites Web. Pour plus d’informations sur la suppression de vos témoins dans votre navigateur Web, reportez-vous aux instructions de votre navigateur: [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=fr), [Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/fr-ca/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies), [Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/fr-ca/help/4468242/microsoft-edge-browsing-data-and-privacy), [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/fr-CA/kb/clear-cookies-and-site-data-firefox), [Opera,](https://help.opera.com/fr/latest/web-preferences/#cookies) Safari ([Mac](https://support.apple.com/fr-ca/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac), [iPhone, iPad ou iPod touch](https://support.apple.com/fr-ca/HT201265)).

Si vous choisissez de désactiver les témoins, vous constaterez peut-être que les Sites ne fonctionnent plus de la même manière. Certains témoins sont nécessaires pour enregistrer et respecter les choix que vous avez faits, par exemple le refus d’être contacté ou d’avoir d’autres types de témoins ajoutés à votre Appareil. Si vous supprimez des témoins de votre ordinateur, le témoin utilisé pour reconnaître vos préférences, y compris les Publicités ciblées par centre d’intérêt, sera également supprimé, ce qui vous obligera à effectuer à nouveau vos choix.

Les utilisateurs peuvent également se retirer des réseaux publicitaires tiers en utilisant divers sites Web d’associations professionnelles tels que:

* Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) - [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/)
* Digital Advertising alliance (DAA) – (i) Monde: [https://optout.aboutads.info/](https://optout.aboutads.info/); (ii) Europe: [http://youronlinechoices.eu/](http://youronlinechoices.eu/)

Lorsque vous désactivez les Publicités ciblées par centre d’intérêt, vous ne recevez plus de contenus ou de publicités ciblées par centre d’intérêt de la part de ces sociétés, mais cela ne signifie pas que vous ne recevrez plus de publicités sur notre site Web ou d’autres sites Web. Vous verrez peut-être encore des publicités Honeywell, mais celles-ci ne seront pas personnalisées pour vous par Honeywell ou nos partenaires. Si, à tout moment, vous ne souhaitez pas que vos renseignements personnels soient utilisés pour permettre à des tiers d’afficher des publicités ou de personnaliser les publicités que vous voyez, vous pouvez également ajuster vos paramètres en utilisant les outils fournis par des tiers tels que Google, Facebook et LinkedIn.

**Ne pas suivre (DNT)**

Certains navigateurs Web peuvent envoyer des signaux «ne pas suivre» aux Sites avec lesquels vous communiquez. Comme l’intégration et l’activation de cette fonction diffèrent d’un navigateur à l’autre, il peut être difficile de déterminer si l’utilisateur permet sciemment la transmission de ces signaux ou s’il a conscience de l’existence d’un tel mécanisme. Nous ne pouvons pas agir en réponse à ces signaux. Vous pouvez également désactiver certains suivis (par exemple en désactivant des témoins) ainsi que les publicités ciblées en suivant les instructions de la section ["Désactivation des témoins et des Publicités ciblées par centre d’intérêt"](#disablingcookies-frenchca).

Dieser Cookie-Hinweis beschreibt, wie Honeywell International Inc. und die verbundenen Unternehmen (zusammen "**Honeywell**“, "**uns**“ oder "**wir**“) Cookies und ähnliche Technologien verwenden, die auf Geräten ("**Geräte**“) der Besucher oder Benutzer unserer Website, Produkte und/oder Anwendungen ("**Websites**“) installiert sind.

Cookies und ähnliche Technologien können personenbezogene Daten verarbeiten. Bitte besuchen Sie:

* unsere [Datenschutzerklärung](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/privacy-statement#german), wenn Sie weitere Informationen darüber erhalten möchten, wie wir Ihre personenbezogenen Daten verarbeiten und wie Sie von Ihren Rechten als betroffene Person Gebrauch machen können

**Was sind Cookies?**

Cookies sind kleine Textdateien, die unsere Websites auf Ihren Geräten ablegen. Wenn Sie unsere Websites erneut besuchen, stellen unsere Technologien automatisch eine Verbindung mit dem Cookie her, um Sie oder Ihr Gerät zu identifizieren und Informationen zu Ihnen abzurufen, z. B. Ihre Spracheinstellungen oder Anmeldeinformationen. Darüber hinaus verwenden wir Cookies von Drittanbietern. Dabei handelt es sich um Cookies von einer anderen Domäne als der Domäne der von Ihnen besuchten Website. Dies ermöglicht es uns, dem Drittanbieter, von dem die Cookies stammen, und unter Umständen anderen Teilnehmern in Cookie-Netzwerken, Sie oder Ihr Gerät zu identifizieren, wenn Sie verschiedene Websites besuchen. Das Wort „Cookies“ umfasst Text, Pixel, transparente GIFs, Protokolldateien, Web-Beacons oder andere ähnliche Nachverfolgungstechnologien, die auf Ihren Geräten abgelegt werden.

**Es gibt vier Arten von Cookies, die wir möglicherweise verwenden:**

* **Absolut notwendige Cookies** sind notwendig, damit unsere Websites funktionieren und wir Ihnen die angeforderten Services und Informationen bereitstellen können. Absolut notwendige Cookies sind von der Zustimmungserfordernis ausgenommen.
* **Funktions-Cookies** ermöglichen eine bessere Funktionalität und Personalisierung. Beispielsweise können unsere Websites mit diesen Cookies von Ihnen angegebene Informationen, z. B. Ihre Spracheinstellungen, sowie technische Informationen speichern, die für Ihre Interaktionen mit unseren Websites nützlich sind. Sie können von uns oder von Drittanbietern gesetzt werden, deren Services wir unseren Websites hinzugefügt haben. Wenn Sie diese Cookies nicht erlauben, funktionieren möglicherweise einzelne oder alle Services nicht richtig.
* **Leistungs-Cookies** erfassen Informationen über Ihre Nutzung unserer Websites (z. B. ermöglichen sie uns, Besuche und Datenverkehrsquellen zu zählen) und helfen uns dabei, mehr über die Leistung unserer Websites zu erfahren. Dadurch können wir wichtige Verbesserungen vornehmen, die Ihre Browsererfahrung verbessern könnten (z. B. erfahren wir durch diese Cookies, welche Seiten am beliebtesten und welche am wenigsten beliebt sind). Alle von diesen Cookies erfassten Informationen werden aggregiert und sind daher anonym.
* **Werbe-/Targeting-Cookies** erfassen Informationen zu Ihren Online-Aktivitäten und identifizieren Ihre Interessen, sodass wir ein Profil für Sie erstellen und Ihnen Werbung anzeigen können, die besser zu Ihnen passt. Darüber hinaus erfüllen sie weitere Funktionen. Beispielsweise verhindern sie, dass laufend dieselben Werbeanzeigen angezeigt werden, stellen sicher, dass Werbeanzeigen korrekt dargestellt werden und wählen Werbeanzeigen basierend auf Ihren Interessen aus.

Weitere Informationen zu den von Honeywell verwendeten Cookies finden Sie in unserem [Center für Datenschutzeinstellungen.](#)

**Warum verwenden wir Cookies und ähnliche Technologien?**

Wir verwenden Cookies und andere ähnliche Nachverfolgungstechnologien für die folgenden Zwecke:

* Speichern Ihrer Einstellungen;
* Gewähren Ihrer Anmeldung und Authentifizierung, damit Sie auf unsere Websites zugreifen und innerhalb unserer Websites von Seite zu Seite navigieren können;
* Sichern unserer Websites, einschließlich der Erkennung und Vermeidung von Betrug;
* Anpassen der Ihnen angezeigten Informationen basierend auf Ihren Browservoreinstellungen, wie beispielsweise Sprache und Region
* Überwachen der Datenverkehrsmuster der Benutzer innerhalb unserer Websites und Erfassen von Statistiken zu Ihrer Website-Nutzung, um mehr über die Leistung unserer Websites und darüber zu erfahren, wie wir unsere Websites verbessern können, um beispielsweise Ihr Browsererlebnis verbessern und Services anbieten zu können, die besser zu Ihnen passen;
* Erfassen von geschäftlichen und Marketinginformationen;
* Nachverfolgen von Benutzern, die unsere Websites, Social-Media-Seiten, Online-Werbeanzeigen und Marketingkommunikation besuchen, nutzen oder mit diesen interagieren (z. B. Informationen dazu, auf welche Werbeanzeigen geklickt wurde oder ob ein Benutzer eine E-Mail, die wir ihm gesendet haben, geöffnet oder weitergeleitet hat); und
* [Gezielte Werbung](#targetedadvertising-german); sowie
* [Geräte- und websiteübergreifende Nachverfolgung](#crossdevice-german).

**Wer verwendet die in Cookies und ähnlichen Nachverfolgungstechnologien gespeicherten Informationen?**

Die in den Cookies unserer Websites gespeicherten Informationen werden ausschließlich von uns (oder von Drittanbietern, die in unserem Auftrag arbeiten) verwendet. Eine Ausnahme hierzu stellen die Drittanbieter-Cookies dar. Diese werden von externen Parteien verwendet und verwaltet, um von uns angeforderte Services bereitzustellen, mit denen wir unsere Services und Ihre Erfahrung bei der Navigation auf unseren Websites verbessern möchten. Weitere Informationen zu den von Honeywell verwendeten Erstanbieter- und Drittanbieter-Cookies finden Sie in unserem [Center für Datenschutzeinstellungen](#).

**Was ist mit Flash-Cookies und lokal freigegebenen Objekten?**

Möglicherweise verwenden wir Flash-Cookies oder lokal freigegebene Objekte (Local Shared Objects, „Flash-LSOs“), um Ihre Website-Einstellungen zu speichern, Ihren Besuch zu personalisieren, Betrugsaktivitäten zu verhindern oder andere Website-Vorgänge auszuführen. Wenn keine Flash-LSOs auf Ihrem Computer gespeichert werden sollen, können Sie die Einstellungen Ihres Flash Players mit den Tools in den Website-Speichereinstellungen entsprechend anpassen. Darüber hinaus können Sie Flash-LSOs kontrollieren, indem Sie zu den globalen Speichereinstellungen navigieren und die dort aufgeführten Anweisungen befolgen (dies kann Anweisungen umfassen, in denen beispielsweise das Löschen von vorhandenen Flash-LSOs erläutert wird).

**Gezielte Werbung**

Wir erfassen und analysieren sowohl die individuelle Nutzung als auch aggregierte Informationen zu Ihrer Nutzung unserer Websites. Darüber hinaus arbeiten wir mit Drittanbietern (wie beispielsweise Werbetreibenden und Anzeigenpartnern) zusammen, um Werbung auf unseren Websites anzuzeigen und Werbung auf den Websites von Drittanbietern zu verwalten und bereitzustellen. Diese Drittanbieter verwenden Cookies und ähnliche Nachverfolgungstechnologien, um bestimmte Informationen über Ihre Online-Aktivitäten auf unseren Websites oder anderen Websites von Drittanbietern zu erfassen und zu verwenden, um die Effektivität von Werbeanzeigen und unseren Online-Marketingaktivitäten zu messen und nachzuverfolgen (beispielsweise indem Daten darüber erfasst werden, wie oft Sie auf eine unserer Werbeanzeigen klicken). Diese Informationen können alleine oder in Kombination mit Informationen über Sie verwendet werden, die wir über andere Quellen (wie unsere Datenpartner), Ihre Kontaktinformationen und den Transaktionsverlauf bei Honeywell erhalten, um Rückschlüsse über Ihre Interessen zu ziehen und Ihnen basierend auf Ihren Browser-Aktivitäten und den abgeleiteten Interessen gezielte Werbeanzeigen und Marketingaktionen bereitzustellen, die besser auf sie zugeschnitten sind („interessenbezogene Werbung“). Diese interessenbezogene Werbung wird nur soweit nach geltendem Recht zulässig und entsprechend Ihren Einstellungen für Werbung/Marketing bereitgestellt. Bitte beachten Sie, dass die Cookies und Technologien anderer Drittanbieter der spezifischen Datenschutzrichtlinie des jeweiligen Unternehmens und nicht diesem Cookie-Hinweis unterliegen.

**Geräte- und websiteübergreifende Nachverfolgung**

Wir, unsere Dienstanbieter und andere Drittanbieter (wie beispielsweise Google und andere Anzeigenpartner) können die (direkt über unsere Websites oder über einen Drittarbeiter) über Sie erfassten Informationen verwenden, um die von Ihnen verwendeten Geräte zu identifizieren und Sie online wiederzuerkennen. Wir verwenden diese Informationen, um Ihnen [gezielte Werbung](#targetedadvertising-german) auf verschiedenen Geräten („geräteübergreifender Abgleich“) und Websites („websiteübergreifende Nachverfolgung“) bereitzustellen. Durch den geräteübergreifenden Abgleich und die websiteübergreifende Nachverfolgung können wir die Aktivitäten unserer Kunden besser verstehen, unsere Fähigkeit zur gezielten Werbung verbessern und Anzeigenkampagnen messen (dies umfasst die Beschränkung der Häufigkeit, mit der eine Werbung einem Benutzer angezeigt wird). Darüber hinaus helfen uns diese Maßnahmen bei der Zuordnung von Geräten, sodass wir Ihre Abwahloptionen auf allen Geräten übernehmen können, die mit einem abgewählten Cookie verbunden sind.

**Deaktivieren von Cookies und Abmelden von interessenbezogener Werbung**

Sie können festlegen, ob Sie Cookies erhalten möchten – entweder über unser [Center für Datenschutzeinstellungen](#) oder alternativ, indem Sie in Ihren Browsereinstellungen Website-Cookies löschen und/oder deaktivieren. Weitere Informationen zum Löschen der Cookies in Ihrem Webbrowser finden Sie in den Anweisungen zu Ihrem Browser: [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en),  [Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies), [Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4468242/microsoft-edge-browsing-data-and-privacy), [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/clear-cookies-and-site-data-firefox), [Opera](https://help.opera.com/en/latest/web-preferences/#cookies), Safari ([Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac), [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265), [iPad](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265), or [iPod touch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265)).

Wenn Sie Cookies deaktivieren, funktionieren Websites möglicherweise nicht mehr wie gewohnt. Einige Cookies sind zum Speichern Ihrer Einstellungen in Bezug darauf, dass Sie nicht kontaktiert werden möchten oder Ihrem Gerät keine anderen Arten von Cookies hinzugefügt werden sollen, erforderlich. Wenn Sie Cookies von Ihrem Computer löschen, wird auch das Cookie gelöscht, das zum Speichern Ihrer Einstellungen einschließlich interessenbezogener Werbung verwendet wird, sodass Sie diese Einstellungen erneut festlegen müssen.

Benutzer können sich auch über die Websites von verschiedenen Wirtschaftsverbänden von Drittanbietern-Werbenetzwerken abmelden, z. B.:

* Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) – [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/)
* Digital Advertising alliance (DAA) – (i) Global: [https://optout.aboutads.info/](https://optout.aboutads.info/); (ii) Europa: [http://youronlinechoices.eu/](http://youronlinechoices.eu/)

Wenn Sie sich von interessenbezogener Werbung abmelden, werden Ihnen von diesen Unternehmen keine interessenbezogenen Inhalte oder Anzeigen mehr bereitgestellt. Es bedeutet jedoch nicht, dass Sie über unsere Website oder andere Websites keine Werbung mehr erhalten werden. Ihnen werden möglicherweise weiterhin Anzeigen von Honeywell angezeigt. Diese werden jedoch nicht von Honeywell oder unseren Partnern auf Sie zugeschnitten. Wenn Sie zu irgendeinem Zeitpunkt nicht möchten, dass Ihre personenbezogenen Daten dafür verwendet werden, Drittanbietern die Anzeige von Werbung oder die Personalisierung der Ihnen angezeigten Werbung zu ermöglichen, können Sie Ihre Einstellungen auch mithilfe der von Drittanbietern wie beispielsweise Google, Facebook und LinkedIn bereitgestellten Tools anpassen.

**Do Not Track (DNT, Nicht nachverfolgen)**

Einige Webbrowser übermitteln möglicherweise „Do Not Track“-Signale an die Websites, mit denen Sie kommunizieren. Aufgrund der Unterschiede bei der Integration und der Aktivierung dieser Funktion in den verschiedenen Webbrowsern ist es nicht immer klar, ob die Übertragung dieser Signale von den Benutzern beabsichtigt ist oder ob sie sich darüber überhaupt bewusst sind. Möglicherweise reagieren wir nicht auf diese Signale. Darüber hinaus können Sie bestimmte Nachverfolgungen deaktivieren (z. B. durch die Deaktivierung von Cookies) und sich von gezielter Werbung abmelden, indem Sie die Anweisungen im Abschnitt [Deaktivieren von Cookies und Abmelden von interessenbezogener Werbungbefolgen.](#disablingcookies-german)

A jelen cookie-kkal kapcsolatos közlemény ismerteti, hogy a Honeywell International Inc. és leányvállalatai (együttesen „"**Honeywell**”, "**mi**” vagy "**minket**”) hogyan használnak cookie-kat és hasonló, a weboldalunk, a termékeink és/vagy alkalmazásaink ("**Webhelyek**”) látogatói vagy felhasználói számítógépére, mobileszközére vagy táblagépére ("**Eszközök**”) telepített technológiákat.

A cookie-k és hasonló technológiák személyes adatokat dolgozhatnak fel. Kérjük, tekintse meg a következőt:

* [Adatvédelmi nyilatkozatunk](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/privacy-statement#hungarian) – ha további információt szeretne kapni arról, hogy miként dolgozunk fel személyes adatait, illetve hogyan gyakorolhatja érintetti jogait
* [Adatvédelmi beállításközpontunk](#) – ha további információt szeretne kapni a Webhelyeinken használt adott cookie-król, illetve kezelni szeretné a cookie-beállításokat.

**Mik azok a cookie-k?**

A cookie-k kis szövegfájlok, amelyeket Webhelyeink az Ön Eszközein helyeznek el. Amikor újból felkeresi Webhelyeinket, technológiáink automatikusan csatlakoznak a cookie-hoz, hogy azonosítsák Önt vagy az Ön Eszközét, és betöltsék az Önnel kapcsolatos információkat, például a nyelvi preferenciákat vagy a bejelentkezési információkat. Harmadik féltől származó cookie-kat is használunk. amelyek a meglátogatott webhely domainjétől eltérő domainből származó cookie-k, és amelyek lehetővé teszik számunkra, a cookie-k tulajdonosa számára, illetve bizonyos esetekben a cookie-hálózatok más résztvevői számára, hogy azonosítsák Önt vagy az Ön Eszközét, amikor különböző webhelyeket keres fel. A „Cookie-k” szóval szöveget, képpontokat, átlátszó GIF-eket, naplófájlokat, webjelzőket vagy más hasonló, az Ön Eszközére kerülő nyomkövetési technológiát jelölünk.

**Négyféle cookie-t használhatunk:**

* **Alapvető fontosságú cookie-k** – a Webhelyeink működéséhez, és az Ön által kért szolgáltatások és információk biztosításához szükségesek. Az alapvető fontosságú cookie-kra nem vonatkozik beleegyezés-kérési követelmény.
* **Funkcionális cookie-k** – lehetővé teszik a speciális funkciók biztosítását és a személyre szabást.

Ezeket mi vagy olyan külső szolgáltatók állíthatják be, amelyek szolgáltatásait hozzáadtuk a Webhelyeinkhez. Ha nem engedélyezi ezeket a cookie-kat, előfordulhat, hogy a szolgáltatások vagy egy részük nem fog megfelelően működni.
* **Teljesítménymérési cookie-k** – információkat gyűjtenek a Webhelyeink Ön általi használatáról (például lehetővé teszik számunkra a látogatások számának és a forgalmi forrásoknak a mérését), valamint segítenek felmérni Webhelyeink teljesítményét, hogy megfelelő, a böngészési élményt fokozó fejlesztéseket hajthassunk végre (például lehetővé teszik számunkra annak megállapítását, hogy mely oldalak a legnépszerűbbek és a legkevésbé népszerűek). A cookie-k által összegyűjtött összes információt összesített formában kezeljük, így névtelen.
* **Hirdetési/célzási cookie-k** – adatokat gyűjtenek az Ön online tevékenységéről, és azonosítják érdeklődési köreit, hogy ennek alapján profilt hozhassunk létre Önről, melynek alapján relevánsabb hirdetéseket tudunk megjeleníteni. Olyan funkciókat is ellátnak, mint például az azonos hirdetések ismételt megjelenésének megakadályozása, a hirdetések megfelelő megjelenítésének biztosítása, valamint az Ön érdeklődésének megfelelő hirdetések kiválasztása.

* a felhasználók Webhelyeinken belüli forgalmi mintáinak megfigyeléséhez, a webhelyek használatára vonatkozó statisztikák gyűjtéséhez, a Webhelyeink teljesítményének, valamint annak megismeréséhez, hogy hogyan javíthatjuk Webhelyeinket többek között a böngészési élmény javításához és az Ön számára relevánsabb szolgáltatások biztosításához;
* üzleti és marketinginformációk biztosításához;
* azoknak a felhasználóknak a nyomon követéséhez, akik megtekintik vagy felkeresik bármelyik Webhelyünket, közösségi médiabeli oldalunkat, online hirdetésünket és marketingkommunikációinkat, illetve bármilyen műveletet végeznek ezekkel (például annak kiderítéséhez, hogy mely hirdetésekre kattintanak rá a felhasználók, vagy annak észleléséhez, hogy a felhasználó megnyitott vagy továbbított egy tőlünk kapott e-mailt); valamint
* [célzott hirdetéshez; és](#targetedadvertising-hung)
* [eszközök közötti és webhelyek közötti nyomon követéshez.](#crossdevice-hung)

**Ki használja a cookie-kban és hasonló nyomkövetési technológiákban tárolt információkat?**

Flash-cookie-kat vagy helyi megosztott objektumokat („Flash LSO”) használhatunk az Ön webhelybeállításainak tárolására, a látogatása személyre szabására, a csalások megelőzésére és a webhely egyéb műveleteihez. Ha nem szeretné, hogy Flash LSO-kat tároljunk a számítógépén, a Flash-lejátszó beállításaiban letilthatja a Flash LSO-k tárolását a Website Storage Settings Panelen rendelkezésre álló eszközökkel. A Flash LSO-kat úgy is vezérelheti, hogy megnyitja a Global Storage Settings Panelt, és követi az utasításokat (amelyek többek között a meglévő Flash LSO-k törlésére vonatkozó utasításokat is tartalmazhatnak).

**Célzott hirdetés**

Nyomon követjük és elemezzük mind a Webhelyeink Ön általi használatával kapcsolatos egyedi felhasználást, mind az összesített statisztikai információkat. Harmadik felekkel (például hirdetőkkel és hirdetési partnerekkel) is együttműködünk a hirdetések Webhelyeinken történő megjelenítéséhez, valamint a hirdetések harmadik felek webhelyein történő kezeléséhez és megjelenítéséhez. Az ilyen harmadik felek cookie-kat és hasonló nyomkövetési technológiákat használnak bizonyos, az Ön online tevékenységeivel kapcsolatos információk gyűjtésére és felhasználására – történjenek ezek a tevékenységek akár a Webhelyeinken, akár harmadik felek webhelyein –, a hirdetések és az online marketingtevékenységünk hatékonyságának mérése és nyomon követése (például adatokat gyűjtünk arról, hogy hány alkalommal kattint rá Ön valamelyik hirdetésünkre). Ezeket az információkat önmagukban vagy az Önről más forrásokból (például adatpartnereinktől) beszerzett információkkal, az Ön elérhetőségi adataival és a Honeywell tranzakciós előzményadataival együtt használhatjuk fel arra, hogy következtessünk az Ön érdeklődési köreire, és olyan célzott hirdetéseket és marketinget biztosíthassunk Önnek, amelyek nagyobb mértékben Önre vannak szabva a böngészési tevékenységei és a kikövetkeztetett érdeklődési körei alapján („Érdeklődésen alapuló hirdetések”). Az ilyen érdeklődésen alapuló hirdetéseket csak akkor jelenítjük meg, ha ezt a hatályos törvények megengedi, és az Ön hirdetési/marketingbeállításaiban engedélyezve van. Felhívjuk figyelmét, hogy a harmadik felek cookie-jaira és technológiáira az egyes vállalatok saját adatvédelmi irányelvei vonatkoznak, nem pedig a jelen a cookie-kkal kapcsolatos értesítés.

**Eszközök közötti és webhelyek közötti nyomon követés**

Mi, szolgáltatóink és más harmadik felek (például a Google és más hirdetési partnerek) felhasználhatják az Önről gyűjtött információkat (akár közvetlenül a Webhelyeinkről, akár egy harmadik féltől) annak érdekében, hogy online felismerhessük Önt az Ön által használt Eszközök azonosításával. Ezeket az információkat arra használjuk, hogy [célzott hirdetéseket](#targetedadvertising-hung) jelenítsünk meg több különböző Eszközön („eszközök közötti egyeztetés”) és webhelyeken („webhelyek közötti nyomon követés”). Az eszközök közötti egyeztetés és a webhelyek közötti nyomon követés lehetővé teszi számunkra, hogy jobban megértsük ügyfeleink tevékenységét, javítsuk a hirdetési kampányok célzását és mérését (ideértve annak korlátozását is, hogy egy felhasználó számára hányszor jelenik meg egy adott hirdetés). Segít abban is, hogy összehangoljuk az Eszközöket, hogy megkönnyítsük az Ön leiratkozását az összes olyan Eszközön, amelyről tudjuk, hogy egy olyan cookie-hoz kapcsolódik, melyről Ön leiratkozott.

**A cookie-k letiltása és az érdeklődésen alapuló hirdetésről való leiratkozás**

[Az Adatvédelmi beállításközpontunk](#) használatával adhatja meg a cookie-k fogadásával kapcsolatos döntéseit, továbbá a böngészője beállításai is lehetővé teszik a webhelyek cookie-jainak törlését és/vagy letiltását. A cookie-k böngészőben történő törléséről további információt az adott böngésző dokumentációjában talál: [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=hu), [Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/hu-hu/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies), [Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/hu-hu/help/4468242/microsoft-edge-browsing-data-and-privacy), [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/hu-hu/kb/clear-cookies-and-site-data-firefox), [Opera,](https://help.opera.com/en/latest/web-preferences/#cookies) Safari ([Mac](https://support.apple.com/hu-hu/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac), [iPhone, iPad és iPod touch](https://support.apple.com/hu-hu/HT201265)).

Ha a cookie-k letiltása mellett dönt, előfordulhat, hogy a Webhelyek nem ugyanúgy működnek, mint cookie-kkal. Egyes cookie-kra azért van szükség, hogy rögzítsük és tiszteletben tartsuk azon döntéseit, amelyeket a kapcsolatfelvétel letiltásával, illetve más típusú cookie-k Eszközéhez való hozzáadása tekintetében hozott. Ha törli a cookie-kat a számítógépről, akkor törlődik a preferenciái (többek között az érdeklődésen alapuló hirdetéssel kapcsolatos beállításai) tárolására használt cookie is, így ismét meg kell adnia beállításait.

A felhasználók különféle szakmai szövetségek webhelyeinek, például a következőknek a használatával is letilthatják a harmadik felek hirdetési hálózatait:

* Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) – [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/)
* Digital Advertising alliance (DAA) – (i) globálisan: [https://optout.aboutads.info/](https://optout.aboutads.info/); (ii) Európában: [http://youronlinechoices.eu/](http://youronlinechoices.eu/)

Az érdeklődésen alapuló hirdetésekről való leiratkozással letiltja e társaságok érdeklődésen alapuló tartalmainak vagy hirdetéseinek megjelenítését, de ez nem jelenti azt, hogy Ön a továbbiakban nem fog hirdetéseket lázni a webhelyünkön vagy más webhelyeken. Továbbra is láthatja a Honeywell hirdetéseit, de ezeket nem fogják személyre szabni a Honeywell vagy partnerei. Ha bármikor úgy dönt, hogy nem szeretné, ha személyes adatait felhasználnák arra, hogy harmadik felek számára lehetővé tegyék a hirdetések megjelenítését, vagy személyre szabják az Ön számára megjelenített hirdetéseket, akkor a beállításokat olyan harmadik felek által biztosított eszközök használatával is módosíthatja, mint pl. a Google, a Facebook és a LinkedIn.

**Do Not Track (DNT)**

Egyes webböngészők "do not track” (követés letiltása) jeleket továbbíthatnak azoknak a Webhelyeknek, amelyekkel Ön kommunikál. Mivel az egyes webböngészők különbözőképpen valósítják meg és aktiválják ezt a funkciót, nem mindig egyértelmű, hogy a felhasználók szándékosan továbbítják-e ezeket a jeleket, illetve hogy egyáltalán tudomásuk van-e ezek létezéséről. Előfordulhat, hogy nem vesszük figyelembe ezeket a jeleket. Letilthatja a nyomon követés bizonyos fajtáit (pl. a cookie-k letiltásával), és a célzott hirdetésekről is leiratkozhat, ha követi a [A cookie-k letiltása és az érdeklődésen alapuló hirdetésről való leiratkozás](#disablingcookies-hung) szakaszban olvasható utasításokat.

La presente Informativa sui cookie descrive come Honeywell International Inc. e le sue affiliate (collettivamente “**Honeywell**”, "**nostro**" o “**noi**”) utilizzano cookie e tecnologie assimilabili installati su dispositivi quali computer, dispositivi mobili o tablet (“**Dispositivi**”) dei visitatori o degli utenti del nostro sito web, dei nostri prodotti e/o applicazioni (“**Siti**”).

Cookie e tecnologie assimilabili possono elaborare informazioni personali. Vi invitiamo a prendere visione di quanto segue:

* la nostra [Informativa sulla privacy](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/privacy-statement#italian) se desidera ricevere maggiori informazioni su come trattiamo le informazioni personali dell'utente e su come esercitare i propri diritti in materia di dati personali
* il nostro [Centro preferenze sulla privacy](#) per maggiori informazioni sui cookie specifici che utilizziamo sui nostri siti e per gestire le preferenze relative ai cookie.

**Cosa sono i cookie?**

I cookie sono piccoli file di testo che i nostri siti inviano e registrano nei dispositivi degli utenti. Quando l'utente visita nuovamente i nostri siti, le nostre tecnologie si collegano automaticamente al cookie per identificare l'utente o il suo dispositivo e richiamare informazioni sull'utente, come la preferenza della lingua o le informazioni di accesso. Utilizziamo anche cookie di terze parti, che sono cookie di un dominio diverso da quello del sito web che l'utente sta visitando e che permettono a noi, alla terza parte proprietaria dei cookie e, in alcuni casi, ad altri partecipanti alle reti di cookie di identificare l'utente o il suo dispositivo mentre visita diversi siti web. Utilizziamo la parola "cookie" per includere un pezzo di testo, pixel, clear gif, file di log, web beacon o altre tecnologie di tracciamento simili che sono installate sui dispositivi dell'utente.

**Esistono quattro tipi di cookie che possiamo utilizzare:**

* **I cookie strettamente necessari** sono essenziali per il funzionamento dei nostri Siti e per fornire all'utente i servizi e le informazioni che ha richiesto. I cookie strettamente necessari non richiedono alcun consenso.
* **I cookie funzionali** permettono una maggiore funzionalità e personalizzazione. Per esempio, consentono ai nostri siti di ricordare le informazioni fornite dall'utente, come le preferenze di lingua e di memorizzare informazioni tecniche utili per l'interazione con i nostri siti. Possono essere impostati da noi o da fornitori terzi i cui servizi siano stati aggiunti ai nostri siti. Se non si accettano questi cookie, alcuni o tutti questi servizi potrebbero non funzionare correttamente.
* **I cookie di prestazione** acquisiscono informazioni sull'utilizzo dei nostri siti (per esempio, ci consentono di contare il numero di visitatori e le fonti di traffico) e ci aiutano a conoscere le prestazioni dei nostri siti in modo da poter apportare miglioramenti rilevanti che potrebbero ottimizzare l'esperienza di navigazione degli utenti (per esempio, ci consentono di sapere quali siano le pagine più e quali le meno apprezzate). Tutte le informazioni acquisite da questi cookie sono aggregate e quindi anonime.
* **I cookie pubblicitari/di profilazione** acquisiscono dati sull'attività online dell'utente e identificano i suoi interessi in modo da poter creare un profilo dell'utente e fornire una pubblicità più mirata. Svolgono anche funzioni come evitare che gli stessi annunci riappaiano continuamente, garantire la corretta visualizzazione degli annunci e selezionare gli annunci in base agli interessi dell'utente.

Per maggiori informazioni sui cookie utilizzati da Honeywell vi invitiamo a visitare il nostro [Centro preferenze sulla privacy](#).

**Perché utilizziamo i cookie e altre tecnologie assimilabili?**

Utilizziamo i cookie e altre tecnologie di tracciamento assimilabili per i seguenti scopi:

* memorizzare preferenze e impostazioni;
* consentire l'accesso e l'autenticazione dell'utente in modo che possa accedere ai nostri siti e passare da una pagina all'altra all'interno dei nostri siti;
* proteggere i nostri siti, in particolare per il rilevamento e la prevenzione delle frodi;
* personalizzare le informazioni fornite all'utente in base alle preferenze di navigazione, quali lingua e area geografica;
* monitorare i modelli di traffico degli utenti all'interno dei nostri siti ed acquisire statistiche sull'utilizzo del sito web per aiutarci a comprendere le prestazioni dei nostri siti e in che modo possiamo migliorarli per ottimizzare l'esperienza di navigazione e offrire servizi di maggiore rilevanza per l'utente;
* fornirci informazioni commerciali e di marketing;
* tracciare gli utenti che visitano, interagiscono con, o utilizzano uno dei nostri siti, le pagine di social media, gli annunci pubblicitari online e le comunicazioni di marketing (per esempio, quali annunci pubblicitari sono stati cliccati o se un utente ha aperto o inoltrato una e-mail che gli abbiamo inviato); e
* [pubblicità mirata](#targetedadvertising-italian); e
* [tracciamento cross-device e cross-site](#crossdevice-italian).

**Chi utilizza le informazioni memorizzate nei cookie e nelle tecnologie di tracciamento assimilabili?**

Le informazioni memorizzate nei cookie dei nostri siti sono utilizzate esclusivamente da noi (o da terze parti che agiscono per nostro conto), ad eccezione dei cookie di terze parti che sono utilizzati e gestiti da soggetti esterni per fornire i servizi da noi richiesti per ottimizzare i nostri servizi e l'esperienza degli utenti durante la navigazione nei nostri siti. Per maggiori informazioni sui cookie di prima parte e di terze parti utilizzati da Honeywell, si rimanda al nostro [Centro preferenze sulla privacy](#).

**E riguardo ai cookie di Flash chiamati anche oggetti locali condivisi??**

Possiamo utilizzare cookie di Flash o oggetti locali condivisi (“Flash LSO”) per memorizzare le preferenze dell'utente sul sito web, personalizzare la visita, prevenire le frodi e per altre operazioni del sito. Se non si desidera che i Flash LSO vengano memorizzati sul proprio computer, è possibile regolare le impostazioni del proprio Flash player per bloccare la memorizzazione dei Flash LSO utilizzando gli strumenti contenuti nel pannello delle impostazioni di memorizzazione del sito web. È inoltre possibile controllare i Flash LSO andando al pannello delle impostazioni di archiviazione globale e seguendo le istruzioni (che possono includere istruzioni che spiegano, per esempio, come cancellare i Flash LSO esistenti).

**Pubblicità mirata**

Tracciamo e analizziamo sia l'uso individuale che le informazioni statistiche aggregate relative all'utilizzo dei nostri siti. Collaboriamo inoltre con terze parti (come inserzionisti e partner pubblicitari) per presentare annunci pubblicitari sui nostri siti e per gestire e servire inserzioni pubblicitarie su altri siti di terze parti. Queste terze parti utilizzano cookie e tecnologie di tracciamento assimilabili per acquisire e utilizzare alcune informazioni sulle attività online degli utenti, sia sui nostri siti che su altri siti di terze parti, per misurare e monitorare l'efficacia della pubblicità e delle nostre attività di marketing online (per esempio, registrando dati sul numero di volte in cui si fa clic su una delle nostre pubblicità). Queste informazioni possono essere utilizzate da sole o in combinazione con le informazioni sull'utente che otteniamo da altre fonti (come i nostri partner di dati), i dati di contatto e la cronologia delle transazioni di Honeywell per identificare gli interessi degli utenti e fornire loro pubblicità e marketing mirati che siano più adatti a loro in base alle loro attività di navigazione e agli interessi individuati ("Pubblicità basata sugli interessi"). Tale pubblicità basata sugli interessi sarà fornita solo se consentito dalla legge applicabile e in conformità con le preferenze di pubblicità/marketing espresse dall'utente. Si segnala che i cookie e le tecnologie di altre terze parti sono disciplinati dalla politica sulla privacy specifica di ciascuna società e non dalla presente Informativa sui cookie.

**Tracciamento cross-device e cross-site**

Noi, i nostri fornitori di servizi e altre terze parti (come Google e altri partner pubblicitari) possiamo utilizzare le informazioni che acquisiamo sugli utenti (direttamente dai nostri siti o da una terza parte) allo scopo di riconoscerli online identificando i dispositivi che utilizzano. Utilizziamo queste informazioni per offrire [pubblicità mirata](#targetedadvertising-italian) su più dispositivi diversi ("corrispondenza cross-device") e siti ("tracciamento cross-site"). La corrispondenza cross-device ed il tracciamento cross-site ci consentono di comprendere meglio l'attività dei nostri clienti, migliorare la nostra capacità di indirizzare e misurare le campagne pubblicitarie (compresa la limitazione del numero di volte che un utente vede un annuncio). Ci consentono inoltre di abbinare i dispositivi in modo da poter favorire le scelte di disattivazione (opt-out) dell'utente su tutti i dispositivi che sappiamo essere collegati a un cookie disattivato.

**Disabilitazione dei cookie e disattivazione (opt-out) della pubblicità basata sugli interessi dell'utente**

È possibile operare opportune scelte sulla ricezione dei cookie utilizzando il nostro [Centro preferenze sulla privacy](#) o, in alternativa, le impostazioni del proprio browser dovrebbero consentire di eliminare e/o disattivare i cookie del sito web. Per maggiori informazioni su come eliminare i cookie nel proprio browser web, fare riferimento alle istruzioni del browser: [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en),  [Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies), [Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4468242/microsoft-edge-browsing-data-and-privacy), [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/clear-cookies-and-site-data-firefox), [Opera](https://help.opera.com/en/latest/web-preferences/#cookies), Safari ([Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac), [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265), [iPad](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265), or [iPod touch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265)).

Se si sceglie di disabilitare i cookie, è possibile che i siti non funzionino allo stesso modo. Alcuni cookie sono necessari per registrare e rispettare le scelte che sono state fatte per non essere contattati o per non aggiungere altri tipi di cookie al proprio dispositivo. Se si eliminano i cookie dal computer, anche il cookie utilizzato per riconoscere le preferenze dell'utente, compresa la pubblicità basata sugli interessi, sarà eliminato, richiedendo all'utente di effettuare nuovamente le proprie scelte.

Gli utenti possono anche decidere di disattivare le reti pubblicitarie di terze parti attraverso l'uso di vari siti web di associazioni commerciali, quali:

* Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) - [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/)
* Digital Advertising alliance (DAA) – (i) Global: [https://optout.aboutads.info/](https://optout.aboutads.info/); (ii) Europe: [http://youronlinechoices.eu/](http://youronlinechoices.eu/)

La disattivazione della pubblicità basata sugli interessi dell'utente implica la rinuncia alla fornitura da parte di queste aziende di contenuti o annunci basati sui propri interessi, ma non significa che non si riceverà più alcuna pubblicità attraverso il nostro sito web o altri siti web. È possibile continuare a vedere gli annunci di Honeywell, ma tali annunci non saranno personalizzati da Honeywell o dai nostri partner. Se in qualsiasi momento non si desidera che i propri dati personali vengano utilizzati per consentire a terzi di visualizzare annunci pubblicitari o per personalizzare gli annunci visualizzati, è possibile modificare le impostazioni utilizzando gli strumenti forniti da terzi, quali Google, Facebook e LinkedIn.

**Do Not Track (DNT)**

Alcuni browser Web possono trasmettere segnali “do-not-track” ai siti con cui l'utente comunica. A causa delle diverse modalità con cui i browser Web integrano e attivano tale funzionalità, non è sempre chiaro se gli utenti desiderano che tali segnali vengano trasmessi o se invece non sono neppure al corrente del loro invio. Potremmo non agire in risposta a questi segnali. L'utente può anche disabilitare il tracciamento (per esempio disabilitando i cookie) e può anche disattivare la pubblicità mirata seguendo le istruzioni riportate nella sezione “[Disabilitazione dei cookie e disattivazione (opt-out) della pubblicità basata sugli interessi dell'utente](#disablingcookies-italian)”.

본 쿠키 고지(Cookie Notice)에서는 Honeywell International Inc. 및 그 계열사(총칭 “**Honeywell**”, "**당사**" 또는 “**당사의**”)가 당사 웹사이트, 제품 및/또는 애플리케이션(“**사이트**”)의 방문자 또는 사용자가 사용하는 컴퓨터, 모바일 기기 또는 태블릿(“**디바이스**”)에 설치되는 쿠키 및 유사 기술을 사용하는 방법에 대해 설명합니다.

쿠키 및 유사 기술은 개인 정보를 처리할 수 있습니다. 참고:

* 당사가 이용자의 개인 정보를 처리하는 방법과 이용자가 자신의 데이터 주체 권리를 행사하는 방법에 관한 자세한 사항은 당사의 [개인정보 보호 정책](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/privacy-statement#korean)을 참고하시기 바랍니다
* 당사가 당사 사이트에서 사용하는 구체적인 쿠키 및 쿠키 설정 관리 방법에 관한 자세한 정보는 당사의 [개인정보 보호 설정 센터(Privacy Preference Center)](#)에서 확인하시기 바랍니다.

**쿠키란 무엇인가요?**

쿠키는 당사 사이트가 이용자의 디바이스에 설치하는 작은 텍스트 파일입니다. 이용자가 당사 사이트를 재방문하면 당사 기술이 쿠키와 자동으로 연결해 이용자 또는 이용자 디바이스를 식별하고, 이용자의 언어 설정 또는 로그인 정보 등 해당 이용자에 대한 정보를 불러옵니다. 또한 당사는 서드 파티 쿠키도 사용합니다. 서드 파티 쿠키는 현재 이용자가 방문하고 있는 웹사이트 도메인과 다른 도메인에서 오는 쿠키로, 당사와 그 쿠키를 소유하고 있는 제3자, 그리고 경우에 따라 쿠키 네트워크의 다른 참여자들은 이 쿠키를 이용해 이용자가 다른 웹사이트들을 방문했을 때 이용자 또는 이용자 디바이스를 식별할 수 있습니다. 당사가 사용하는 "쿠키"라는 말에는 이용자 디바이스에 설치되는 텍스트, 픽셀, 클리어, 로그 파일, 웹 비컨 또는 그 외에 그와 유사한 추적 기술이 포함됩니다.

**당사가 사용할 수 있는 쿠키에는 4가지 유형이 있습니다.**

* **반드시 필요한 쿠키**는 당사 사이트가 기능을 수행하고 이용자에게 이용자가 요청한 서비스 및 정보를 제공하는 데 필요한 쿠키입니다. 반드시 필요한 쿠키는 동의 요건 대상에서 제외됩니다.
* **기능 쿠키**는 고급 기능과 개인 맞춤 설정을 지원합니다. 예를 들어, 당사 사이트는 기능 쿠키를 이용해 이용자의 언어 설정 등 이용자가 제공하는 정보를 기억하고, 이용자가 당사 사이트를 이용할 때 유용하게 사용할 수 있는 기술적 정보를 저장합니다. 기능 쿠키는 당사, 또는 당사가 당사 사이트에 추가한 서비스를 제공하는 제3자 제공자가 설정할 수 있습니다.  기능 쿠키를 허용하지 않는 경우 이러한 서비스의 일부 또는 전체가 제대로 작동하지 않을 수 있습니다.
* **성능 쿠키**를 이용하면 당사가 이용자의 브라우징 경험을 향상시킬 수 있는 관련 개선 조치를 실시(예를 들어, 어느 페이지가 가장 인기가 높거나 낮은지 알 수 있습니다)할 수 있도록 이용자의 당사 사이트 이용에 관한 정보(예를 들어, 당사는 성능 쿠키를 이용해 방문 횟수와 트래픽 출처를 셀 수 있습니다)를 수집하고 당사 사이트의 성능을 확인할 수 있습니다. 이러한 쿠키가 수집하는 정보는 모두 취합되기 때문에 익명으로 처리됩니다.
* **광고/표적 쿠키**는 당사가 이용자를 위한 프로필을 생성하고 이용자와 더 관련성 높은 광고를 제공할 수 있도록 이용자의 온라인 활동에 관한 데이터를 수집하고 이용자의 관심사를 파악합니다. 또한, 계속해서 같은 광고가 표시되는 것을 막는 기능, 광고가 올바로 표시되도록 하는 기능 및 이용자의 관심사에 따라 광고를 선택하는 기능 등을 수행합니다.

Honeywell이 사용하는 쿠키에 관한 자세한 정보는 당사의 [개인정보 보호 설정 센터(Privacy Preference Center)](#) 에서 확인하실 수 있습니다.

**Honeywell이 쿠키나 그 외 유사 기술을 사용하는 이유는 뭔가요?**

당사는 다음과 같은 목적으로 쿠키 및 유사 추적 기술을 사용하고 있습니다.

* 이용자의 선호 사항 및 설정을 저장합니다.
* 이용자가 당사 사이트에 액세스하고 당사 사이트 내에서 다른 페이지로 이동해 다닐 수 있도록 이용자의 로그인 및 신분 인증을 허용합니다.
* 사기 감지 및 예방 등 당사 사이트의 보안을 유지합니다.
* 언어, 지리적 지역 등, 이용자의 브라우징 설정에 따라 맞춤 정보를 표시합니다.
* 당사 사이트의 성능을 파악하고, 이용자의 브라우징 경험을 향상시키고 이용자에게 보다 관련성 있는 서비스를 제공하는 등의 목적을 위해 당사 사이트를 개선할 수 있는 방법을 찾기 위해 당사 사이트 내에서 이용자들의 트래픽 패턴을 모니터링하고 이용자의 웹사이트 이용에 관한 통계 자료를 수집합니다.
* 당사에 비즈니스 및 마케팅 정보를 제공합니다.
* 당사 사이트, 소셜 미디어 페이지, 온라인 광고 및 마케팅 커뮤니케이션(예를 들어 클릭할 수 있는 광고, 또는 당사가 이용자에게 이메일을 보냈을 때 이용자가 그 이메일을 열어보았거나 다른 사람에게 전달한 경우 등)을 방문하거나, 클릭하거나, 사용하는 경우 그것을 추적합니다.
* [표적 광고](#targetedadvertisingkorean), 그리고
* [크로스 디바이스 및 크로스 사이트 추적](#crossdevicekorean).

**쿠키와 유사 추적 기술에 저장되어 있는 정보는 누가 사용하나요?**

당사 사이트의 쿠키에 저장되어 있는 정보는 전적으로 당사(또는 당사를 대신하는 제3자)가 사용합니다. 단, 당사 서비스와 당사 사이트를 이용하는 이용자들의 이용 경험을 향상시키기 위해 당사의 요청에 따라 서비스를 제공하기 위해 외부 당사자들이 사용 및 관리하는 서드 파티 쿠키의 경우는 예외로 합니다. Honeywell이 사용하는 퍼스트 파티 및 서드 파티 쿠키에 관한 자세한 사항은 당사의 [개인정보 보호 설정 센터(Privacy Preference Center)](#) 에서 확인하실 수 있습니다.

**플래시 쿠키나 로컬 공유 객체(LSO)는 어떤가요?**  
  
당사는 이용자의 웹사이트 설정을 저장하고, 이용자의 방문을 개인 맞춤화하고, 사기를 방지하는 목적, 그리고 그 외 사이트 운영 목적으로 플래시 쿠키 또는 로컬 공유 객체("플래시 LSO")를 사용할 수 있습니다. 이용자가 컴퓨터에 저장되어 있는 플래시 LSO 사용을 원치 않는 경우, 웹사이트 저장 설정 패널(Website Storage Settings Panel)에 있는 도구를 사용해 플래시 LSO 저장을 차단하도록 플래시 플레이어 설정을 변경하면 됩니다. 또한, 전체 저장 설정 패널(Global Storage Settings Panel)로 가서 안내에 따라 플래시 LSO 설정을 변경할 수도 있습니다(안내에는 예를 들어 기존 플래시 LSO를 삭제하는 방법도 포함될 수 있습니다).

**표적 광고**

당사는 이용자의 당사 사이트 이용과 관련한 개인별 이용 정보와 취합된 통계 정보를 모두 추적하고 분석합니다. 또한 당사는 당사 사이트에 광고를 게재하고 다른 제3자 사이트에서 광고를 관리 및 게재하기 위해 제3자(광고주 및 광고 파트너 등)와 파트너 관계를 맺기도 합니다. 이러한 제3자는 광고의 효과성과 당사의 온라인 마케팅 활동을 측정 및 추적하기 위해 당사 사이트에서나 다른 제3자 사이트들에서 이용자의 온라인 활동에 관한 특정 정보를 수집 및 사용하기 위해 쿠키 및 유사 추적 기술을 사용합니다(예를 들어, 이용자가 당사 광고 중 하나를 클릭한 횟수에 관한 데이터를 수집). 이러한 정보는 이용자의 관심사를 추론하고 이용자의 브라우징 활동 및 추론한 관심사를 바탕으로 이용자에게 더 맞게 만들어진 표적 광고 및 마케팅("관심 기반 광고")을 전달하기 위해 단독으로, 또는 당사가 다른 출처(예: 당사 데이터 파트너)에서 이용자에 관해 수집하는 정보, 이용자의 연락처 정보 및 Honeywell 거래 이력 등과 결합해 사용될 수 있습니다. 이러한 관심 기반 광고는 관련 법률에서 허용하는 경우에 한해, 이용자의 광고/마케팅 선호 사항에 따라 제공됩니다. 다른 제3자의 쿠키 및 기술에는 본 쿠키 고지가 아니라 각 기업별 개인정보 보호 정책이 적용된다는 사실에 유의하시기 바랍니다.

**크로스 디바이스 및 크로스 사이트 추적**

당사, 당사의 서비스 제공자 및 기타 제3자(예: Google 및 기타 광고 파트너)는 이용자가 사용하는 디바이스를 식별해 온라인 상에서 이용자를 인지하기 위한 목적으로 당사가 이용자에 관해 (당사 사이트에서 직접 또는 제3자로부터) 수집한 정보를 사용할 수 있습니다. 당사는 여러 다른 디바이스("크로스 디바이스 매칭") 및 사이트("크로스 사이트 추적")에 걸쳐 이용자에게 [표적 광고](#targetedadvertisingkorean)를 제공하는 데 이 정보를 사용합니다. 당사는 크로스 디바이스 매칭과 크로스 사이트 추적을 통해 당사 고객들의 활동을 보다 잘 이해하고, 광고 캠페인의 표적을 정하고 측정하는 능력을 향상시킬 수 있습니다(이용자가 특정 광고를 보게 되는 횟수를 제한하는 것 포함). 또한, 당사는 이를 통해 디바이스를 매칭함으로써 당사가 옵트아웃된 쿠키에 연결되어 있다는 것을 아는 모든 디바이스에 걸쳐 이용자의 옵트아웃 선택을 적용할 수 있습니다.

* [Volgen over apparaten en sites](#crossdevice-netherlands).

**Wie gebruikt de informatie die is opgeslagen in cookies en vergelijkbare traceringstechnologieën?**

De in de cookies van onze sites opgeslagen informatie wordt uitsluitend gebruikt door ons (of door derden die namens ons optreden), met uitzondering van cookies van derden die worden gebruikt en beheerd door externe partijen, om de door ons gevraagde diensten te verlenen, ter verbetering van onze diensten en uw ervaring bij het navigeren op onze sites. Bezoek ons [Centrum voor privacyvoorkeuren](#) voor meer informatie over de door Honeywell gebruikte eigen cookies en cookies van derden.

**Hoe zit het met Flash-cookies of Local Shared Objects?**

We kunnen Flash-cookies of Local Shared Objects ("Flash LSO's") gebruiken voor het opslaan van uw websitevoorkeuren, het personaliseren van uw bezoek, het voorkomen van fraude en voor andere siteactiviteiten. Als u niet wilt dat er Flash LSO's op uw computer worden opgeslagen, dan kunt u de instellingen van uw Flash-speler aanpassen om de opslag van Flash LSO's te blokkeren met behulp van de hulpmiddelen in het paneel met instellingen voor websiteopslag. U kunt Flash LSO's ook controleren door te gaan naar het Global Storage Settings Panel en de instructies te volgen (waaronder mogelijk instructies die bijvoorbeeld uitleggen hoe u bestaande Flash LSO's kunt verwijderen).

**Gerichte reclame**

We traceren en analyseren zowel geïndividualiseerd gebruik als samengevoegde statistische informatie met betrekking tot uw gebruik van onze sites. We werken ook samen met derden (zoals adverteerders en advertentiepartners) om advertenties op onze sites weer te geven en om advertenties op andere sites van derden te beheren en weer te geven. Deze derde partijen gebruiken cookies en vergelijkbare traceringstechnologieën om bepaalde informatie over uw online activiteiten te verzamelen en te gebruiken, hetzij op onze sites, hetzij op andere sites van derden om de effectiviteit van advertenties en onze online marketingactiviteiten te meten en te traceren (bijvoorbeeld door gegevens te verzamelen over hoe vaak u op een van onze advertenties klikt). Deze informatie kan afzonderlijk worden gebruikt of in combinatie met informatie over u, die we verkrijgen uit andere bronnen (zoals onze gegevenspartners), uw contactgegevens en transactiegeschiedenis bij Honeywell om uw interesses af te leiden en u gerichte reclame en marketing te leveren die meer zijn afgestemd op u, op basis van uw browse-activiteiten en afgeleide interesses ("Op interesses gebaseerde reclame"). Dergelijke op interesses gebaseerde reclame wordt alleen geleverd indien toegestaan door de toepasselijke wetgeving en in overeenstemming met uw reclame-/marketingvoorkeuren. Merk op dat de cookies en technologieën van andere derde partijen zijn onderworpen aan het specifieke privacybeleid van elk bedrijf en niet door deze kennisgeving over cookies.

**Volgen over apparaten en sites**

Wij, onze dienstverleners en andere derde partijen (zoals Google en andere advertentiepartners) kunnen informatie die we over u verzamelen (rechtstreeks van onze sites of van een derde partij) gebruiken om u online te herkennen door het identificeren van de door u gebruikte apparaten. We gebruiken deze informatie om u [gerichte reclame](#targetedadvertising-netherlands) aan te bieden op meerdere verschillende apparaten ("cross-device matching") en sites ("cross-site tracking"). Cross-device matching en cross-site tracking stelt ons in staat om de activiteiten van onze klanten beter te begrijpen, ons vermogen te verbeteren om reclamecampagnes te richten en te meten (inclusief het beperken van het aantal keren dat een gebruiker een advertentie ziet). Het helpt ons ook apparaten te koppelen, zodat we uw keuzes voor uitschrijven kunnen vergemakkelijken over alle apparaten waarvan we weten dat ze zijn verbonden met een uitschrijfcookie.

**Cookies uitschakelen en uitschrijven voor op interesses gebaseerde reclame**

U kunt keuzes maken over het ontvangen van cookies door gebruik te maken van ons [Centrum voor privacyvoorkeuren](#) of u kunt websitecookies verwijderen en/of uitschakelen in uw browserinstellingen.

Als u ervoor kiest om cookies uit te schakelen, dan kunt u merken dat sites mogelijk niet op dezelfde manier werken. Sommige cookies zijn nodig om de keuzes die u hebt gemaakt vast te leggen en te respecteren met betrekking tot het feit dat er geen contact met u wordt opgenomen of dat er geen andere soorten cookies aan uw apparaat worden toegevoegd. Als u cookies verwijdert van uw computer, dan wordt de cookie die wordt gebruikt om uw voorkeuren te herkennen, inclusief op interesses gebaseerde reclame, ook verwijderd en moet u uw keuzes opnieuw maken.

Gebruikers kunnen zich ook afmelden voor advertentienetwerken van derden door het gebruik van verschillende websites van handelsverenigingen, zoals:

* Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) - [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/)

Als u zich uitschrijft voor op interesses gebaseerde reclame, dan wordt u uitgeschreven van het door deze bedrijven leveren van op interesses gebaseerde inhoud of advertenties, maar dit betekent niet dat u geen reclame meer ontvangt via onze website of andere websites. U ziet mogelijk nog steeds Honeywell-advertenties, maar deze advertenties worden niet aangepast aan u door Honeywell of onze partners. Als u op enig moment niet wilt dat uw persoonsgegevens worden gebruikt om derden toe te staan reclame weer te geven of om aan u getoonde reclame te personaliseren, dan kunt u uw instellingen ook aanpassen met behulp van de hulpmiddelen van dergelijk derden. Google, Facebook en LinkedIn.

**Niet volgen (Do Not Track - DNT)**

Sommige webbrowsers verzenden signalen voor "niet volgen" naar sites waarmee u communiceert. Vanwege verschillen in hoe webbrowsers deze functie verwerken en activeren, is het niet altijd duidelijk of gebruikers willen dat deze signalen worden verzonden of dat ze zich zelfs ook maar bewust zijn van deze signalen. We handelen mogelijk niet in reactie op deze signalen. U kunt ook bepaalde tracering uitschakelen (bijvoorbeeld door cookies uit te schakelen) en u kunt zich ook afmelden voor gerichte reclame door het volgen van de instructies in de paragraaf [cookies uitschakelen en afmelden voor op interesses gebaseerde reclame](#disablingcookies-netherlands).

**Oppdatert: 11. juni 2021**

Denne merknaden om informasjonskapsler beskriver hvordan Honeywell International Inc. og dets tilknyttede selskaper (samlet **"Honeywell"**, **"oss"** eller **"vi"**) bruker informasjonskapsler og lignende teknologi installert på enheter som en datamaskin, mobilenhet eller nettbrett (**"enheter"**) av besøkende til eller brukere av nettstedet vårt og våre produkter og/eller applikasjoner (**"nettsteder"**).

Informasjonskapsler og lignende teknologier kan behandle personopplysninger. Besøk gjerne:

* [personvernerklæringen](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/privacy-statement#norwegian) hvis du vil ha mer informasjon om hvordan vi behandler personopplysningene dine, og hvordan du kan utøve dine rettigheter som registrert
* [Senter for personverninnstillinger](#) for mer informasjon om de spesifikke informasjonskapslene vi bruker på våre nettsteder, og for å administrere innstillingene dine for informasjonskapsler.

**Hva er informasjonskapsler?**

Informasjonskapsler er små tekstfiler som nettstedene våre plasserer på enhetene dine. Når du besøker nettstedene våre på nytt, kobles teknologiene våre automatisk til informasjonskapselen for å identifisere deg eller enheten din og huske informasjon om deg, for eksempel språkinnstillinger eller påloggingsinformasjon. Vi bruker også tredjeparts informasjonskapsler, som er informasjonskapsler fra et annet domene enn domenet til nettstedet du besøker, og som tillater oss, tredjeparten som eier informasjonskapslene og i noen tilfeller andre deltakere i informasjonskapselnettverk å identifisere deg eller enheten din når du besøker ulike nettsteder. Med «informasjonskapsler» mener vi tekst, piksler, klare gif-filer, loggfiler, nettsignaler eller annen lignende sporingsteknologi som plasseres på enhetene dine.

**Det er fire typer informasjonskapsler vi kan bruke:**

* **Strengt nødvendige informasjonskapsler** er nødvendige for at nettstedene våre skal fungere og for å gi deg tjenestene og informasjonen du har bedt om. Strengt nødvendige informasjonskapsler er unntatt kravet om samtykke.
* **Funksjonelle informasjonskapsler** muliggjør forbedret funksjonalitet og personlig tilpasning. De gjør det mulig for nettstedene våre å huske opplysninger som du oppgir, for eksempel språkinnstillinger, samt lagre tekniske opplysninger som er nyttige for samhandlingen din med nettstedene våre. De kan plasseres av oss eller av tredjepartsleverandører som vi har lagt til tjenester fra på nettstedene våre. Hvis du ikke tillater disse informasjonskapslene, kan det hende at noen eller alle disse tjenestene ikke fungerer som de skal.
* **Ytelsesinformasjonskapsler** samler inn informasjon om din bruk av nettstedene våre (for eksempel lar de oss telle besøk og trafikkilder) og hjelper oss med å lære hvordan nettstedene våre fungerer, slik at vi kan gjøre relevante forbedringer som kan forbedre nettleseropplevelsen din (for eksempel kan vi finne ut hvilke sider som er mest og minst populære). All informasjon som disse informasjonskapslene samler inn, er anonym.
* **Reklame-/målrettingsinformasjonskapsler** samler inn data om aktiviteten din på nett og identifiserer interessene dine slik at vi kan opprette en profil for deg og vise reklame som er mer relevant for deg. De utfører også funksjoner som å forhindre at de samme annonsene vises igjen kontinuerlig, sørge for at annonsene vises riktig, og velge annonser som er basert på dine interesser.

Hvis du vil ha mer informasjon om informasjonskapslene som Honeywell bruker, kan du besøke [Senter for personverninnstillinger](#).

**Hvorfor bruker vi informasjonskapsler og annen lignende teknologi?**

Vi bruker informasjonskapsler og annen lignende sporingsteknologi for følgende formål:

* Lagre dine preferanser og innstillinger;
* Tillate deg å logge på og autentisere deg slik at du får tilgang til nettstedene våre og kan flytte fra side til side innenfor nettstedene våre;
* Sikre nettstedene våre, inkludert oppdagelse og forebygging av svindel;
* Skreddersy informasjonen som presenteres for deg basert på nettlesingsinnstillingene dine, for eksempel språk og geografisk region;
* Overvåke trafikkmønstrene til brukerne på nettstedene våre og samle statistikk om bruken din av nettstedet for å hjelpe oss med å forstå hvordan nettstedene våre fungerer, og hvordan vi kan forbedre nettstedene våre for formål som å forbedre nettleseropplevelsen og tilby tjenester som er mer relevante for deg;
* Gi oss forretnings- og markedsføringsinformasjon;
* Spore brukere som besøker, samhandler med eller bruker noen av våre nettsteder, sosiale mediesider, nettannonser og markedsføringskommunikasjon (for eksempel hvilke annonser som er klikket på, eller hvis en bruker har åpnet eller videresendt en e-post vi har sendt dem); og
* [Målrettet reklame](#targetedadvertising-norwegian); og
* [Sporing på tvers av enheter og på tvers av nettsteder](#crossdevice-norwegian).

**Hvem bruker informasjonen som er lagret i informasjonskapsler og lignende sporingsteknologi?**

Informasjonen som lagres i våre nettsteders informasjonskapsler, brukes utelukkende av oss (eller av tredjeparter som opptrer på våre vegne), med unntak av tredjeparts informasjonskapsler som brukes og administreres av eksterne parter for å tilby tjenester som vi har bedt om for å forbedre tjenestene våre og opplevelsen din når du navigerer på nettstedene våre. Hvis du vil ha mer informasjon om førsteparts- og tredjeparts informasjonskapsler som Honeywell bruker, kan du besøke [Senter for personverninnstillinger](#).

**Hva med Flash-informasjonskapsler eller lokale delte objekter?**

Vi kan bruke Flash-informasjonskapsler eller lokale delte objekter for å lagre nettstedsinnstillingene dine, tilpasse besøket ditt, forhindre svindel og for andre nettstedsoperasjoner. Hvis du ikke vil ha Flash-informasjonskapsler lagret på datamaskinen din, kan du endre innstillingene til Flash-spilleren slik at Flash-informasjonskapsler blokkeres ved hjelp av verktøyet i Innstillingspanel for lagring av nettsteder. Du kan også kontrollere Flash-informasjonskapsler ved å gå til Globalt innstillingspanel for lagring og følge instruksjonene (som kan inneholde instruksjoner som for eksempel forklarer hvordan du sletter eksisterende Flash-informasjonskapsler).

**Målrettet reklame**

Vi sporer og analyserer både individuell bruk og samlet statistisk informasjon relatert til din bruk av våre nettsteder. Vi samarbeider også med tredjeparter (for eksempel annonsører og annonsepartnere) for å vise reklame på nettstedene våre og for å administrere og vise reklame på andre tredjeparts nettsteder. Disse tredjepartene bruker informasjonskapsler og lignende sporingsteknologier for å samle inn og bruke bestemt informasjon om dine aktiviteter på nettet, enten på nettstedene våre eller andre tredjepartsnettsteder for å måle og spore effektiviteten til reklame og våre markedsføringsaktiviteter på nett (f.eks. ved å samle inn data om hvor mange ganger du klikker på en av annonsene våre). Denne informasjonen kan brukes alene eller i kombinasjon med informasjon om deg som vi får fra andre kilder (som våre datapartnere), dine kontaktopplysninger og Honeywell-transaksjonshistorikk for å utlede dine interesser og levere målrettede annonser og markedsføring som er mer skreddersydd for deg basert på dine nettleseraktiviteter og utledede interesser («interessebasert reklame»). Slik interessebasert reklame vil bare bli levert der det er tillatt i henhold til gjeldende lov og i samsvar med dine reklame-/markedsføringspreferanser. Vær oppmerksom på at informasjonskapsler og teknologier fra andre tredjeparter er underlagt det aktuelle selskapets spesifikke personvernregler og ikke denne merknaden om informasjonskapsler.

**Sporing på tvers av enheter og på tvers av nettsteder**

Vi, tjenesteleverandørene våre og andre tredjeparter (som Google og andre annonsepartnere) kan bruke informasjon vi samler inn om deg (enten direkte fra nettstedene våre eller fra en tredjepart) for å gjenkjenne deg på nett ved å identifisere enhetene du bruker. Vi bruker denne informasjonen til å gi deg [målrettet reklame](#targetedadvertising-norwegian) på tvers av flere ulike enheter ("samsvar mellom enheter") og nettsteder ("sporing på tvers av nettsteder"). Samsvar på tvers av enheter og sporing på tvers av nettsteder lar oss bedre forstå kundens aktivitet og dermed forbedre vår evne til å målrette og måle annonsekampanjer (inkludert begrensning av antall ganger en bruker ser en annonse). Det hjelper oss også å avstemme enheter slik at vi kan gjøre det enklere for deg å velge bort alle enhetene vi vet er koblet til en valgt informasjonskapsel.

**Deaktivere informasjonskapsler og velge bort interessebasert reklame**

Du kan ta valg om å motta informasjonskapsler ved å bruke vårt [Senter for personverninnstillinger](#), eller alternativt bør nettleserinnstillingene tillate deg å slette og/eller deaktivere informasjonskapsler på nettstedet. For mer informasjon om hvordan du sletter informasjonskapslene dine i nettleseren din, kan du se nettleserens instruksjoner: [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en), [Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies), [Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4468242/microsoft-edge-browsing-data-and-privacy), [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/clear-cookies-and-site-data-firefox), [Opera](https://help.opera.com/en/latest/web-preferences/#cookies), Safari ([Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac), [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265), [iPad eller iPod touch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265)).

Hvis du velger å deaktivere informasjonskapsler, kan det hende at nettsteder kanskje ikke fungerer på samme måte. Noen informasjonskapsler er nødvendige for å registrere og respektere valgene du har gjort med hensyn til ikke å bli kontaktet eller for at andre typer informasjonskapsler ikke skal legges til på enheten din. Hvis du sletter informasjonskapsler fra datamaskinen din, vil informasjonskapselen som brukes til å gjenkjenne preferansene dine, inkludert interessebasert reklame, også bli slettet, og du må angi valgene dine på nytt.

Brukere kan også velge bort tredjeparts annonsenettverk ved bruk av ulike nettsteder som tilhører bransjesammenslutninger, som:

* Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) - [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/)
* Digital Advertising alliance (DAA) – (i) Global: [https://optout.aboutads.info/](https://optout.aboutads.info/); (ii) Europa: [http://youronlinechoices.eu/](http://youronlinechoices.eu/)

Hvis du velger bort interessebasert reklame, velger du bort disse selskapenes levering av interessebasert innhold eller annonser til deg, men betyr ikke at du ikke lenger vil motta noen reklame via nettstedet vårt eller andre nettsteder. Du kan fremdeles se Honeywell-annonser, men disse annonsene blir ikke tilpasset til deg av Honeywell eller våre partnere. Hvis du på et eller annet tidspunkt ikke vil at personopplysningene dine skal brukes til å tillate tredjeparter å vise annonser eller til å tilpasse annonser som vises for deg, kan du også justere innstillingene dine ved å bruke verktøyene som tilbys av tredjeparter, som f.eks. Google, Facebook og LinkedIn.

**Ikke spor (DNT)**

Enkelte nettlesere kan sende "ikke-spor"-signaler til nettstedene som brukeren kommuniserer med. På grunn av forskjeller i hvordan nettlesere innlemmer og aktiverer denne funksjonen, er det ikke alltid klart om brukerne har til hensikt å overføre disse signalene, eller om de selv er klar over dem. Vi handler kanskje ikke som svar på disse signalene. Du kan også deaktivere bestemt sporing (f.eks. ved å deaktivere informasjonskapsler), og du kan også velge bort målrettet reklame ved å følge instruksjonene i avsnittet "[Deaktivere informasjonskapsler og velge bort interessebasert reklame](#disablingcookies-norwegian)".

Wszystkie informacje gromadzone przez te pliki cookie są agregowane, a zatem anonimowe.
* **Pliki cookie do obsługi reklam/targetowania** gromadzą dane na temat działań użytkownika online i identyfikują jego zainteresowania, abyśmy mogli stworzyć jego profil i dostarczyć reklamę, która jest do niego lepiej dopasowana. Pełnią również takie funkcje, jak zapobieganie ciągłemu pojawianiu się tych samych reklam, dbanie o prawidłowe wyświetlanie reklam oraz wybieranie reklam opartych na zainteresowaniach użytkownika.

Więcej informacji na temat plików cookie, z których korzysta firma Honeywell, można znaleźć w [Centrum preferencji dotyczących prywatności](#).

**Dlaczego korzystamy z plików cookie i innych podobnych technologii?**

Korzystamy z plików cookie i innych podobnych technologii śledzenia w następujących celach:

* przechowywanie preferencji i ustawień użytkownika;
* zezwalanie na logowanie i uwierzytelnianie użytkownika, aby mógł uzyskać dostęp do Witryn i przechodzić w nich pomiędzy stronami;
* zabezpieczanie naszych Witryn, w tym wykrywanie oszustw i zapobieganie im;
* dostosowywanie przedstawianych użytkownikowi informacji na podstawie jego preferencji w zakresie przeglądania takich jak język i obszar geograficzny;
* monitorowanie wzorców ruchu użytkowników w naszych Witrynach oraz zbieranie statystyk dotyczących korzystania z witryn internetowych przez użytkownika, abyśmy mogli zrozumieć sposób działania naszych Witryn i je ulepszać w celu usprawnienia procesu przeglądania i oferowania usług lepiej dopasowanych do potrzeb użytkownika;
* dostarczanie nam informacji biznesowych i marketingowych;
* śledzenie użytkowników, którzy korzystają z Witryn, stron mediów społecznościowych, reklam online i materiałów marketingowych lub je wyświetlają (np. które reklamy kliknięto i gdzie lub czy użytkownik otworzył lub przekazał wysłaną przez nas wiadomość e-mail);
* [reklama ukierunkowana](#targetedadvertising-polish);
* [śledzenie na różnych urządzeniach i w różnych witrynach](#crossdevice-polish).

**Kto korzysta z informacji zapisanych w plikach cookie i podobnych technologiach śledzenia?**

Informacje przechowywane w plikach cookie Witryn są wykorzystywane wyłącznie przez nas (lub osoby trzecie działające w naszym imieniu) z wyjątkiem plików cookie osób trzecich, które są używane i zarządzane przez strony zewnętrzne do świadczenia usług wymaganych przez nas w celu udoskonalenia naszych usług i obsługi użytkownika podczas nawigacji w Witrynach. Więcej informacji na temat plików cookie tej samej firmy i innych firm używanych przez firmę Honeywell można znaleźć w naszym [Centrum preferencji dotyczących prywatności](#).

**Co z plikami cookie Flash lub lokalnymi obiektami udostępnionymi?**

Możemy używać plików cookie Flash lub lokalnych obiektów udostępnionych („LOU Flash”) do przechowywania preferencji użytkownika dotyczących witryny internetowej, personalizacji jego wizyt, zapobiegania oszustwom i innych operacji w ramach witryny. Jeśli użytkownik nie chce, aby obiekty LOU Flash były przechowywane na jego komputerze, może dostosować ustawienia odtwarzacza Flash, aby zablokować pamięć LOU Flash za pomocą narzędzi z panelu ustawień przechowywania witryn internetowych. Może również sterować obiektami LOU Flash, przechodząc do Panelu globalnych ustawień przechowywania i postępując zgodnie z instrukcjami (które mogą na przykład obejmować instrukcje wyjaśniające, jak usunąć istniejące obiekty LOU Flash).

**Reklama ukierunkowana**

Śledzimy i analizujemy zarówno przypadki indywidualnego korzystania z Witryn, jak i zagregowane informacje statystyczne na ten temat. Współpracujemy również z osobami trzecimi (takimi jak reklamodawcy i partnerzy reklamowi) w celu wyświetlania reklam w Witrynach oraz zarządzania reklamami i wyświetlania ich w innych witrynach osób trzecich. Te osoby trzecie wykorzystują pliki cookie i podobne technologie śledzenia w celu gromadzenia i wykorzystywania niektórych informacji o działaniach online użytkownika, zarówno w naszych Witrynach, jak i innych witrynach osób trzecich, w celu pomiaru i monitorowania skuteczności reklam i naszych działań marketingowych online (na przykład poprzez zbieranie danych o tym, ile razy użytkownik klika jedną z naszych reklam). Informacje te mogą być wykorzystywane odrębnie lub w połączeniu z informacjami o użytkowniku, które uzyskujemy z innych źródeł (takich jak nasi partnerzy w zakresie danych), danymi kontaktowymi użytkownika i historią transakcji w firmie Honeywell, aby wyciągnąć wnioski dotyczące zainteresowań użytkownika i dostarczyć mu ukierunkowane reklamy i marketing, które są bardziej dostosowane do użytkownika na podstawie jego działań związanych z przeglądaniem i wywnioskowanych zainteresowań („Reklama oparta na zainteresowaniach”). Taka Reklama oparta na zainteresowaniach będzie dostarczana tylko wtedy, gdy jest to dozwolone przez obowiązujące prawo i zgodne z preferencjami reklamowymi/marketingowymi użytkownika. Należy pamiętać, że pliki cookie i technologie innych osób trzecich podlegają określonym zasadom dotyczącym ochrony prywatności każdej firmy, a nie tym Informacjom o plikach cookie.

**Śledzenie na różnych urządzeniach i w różnych witrynach.**

My, nasi dostawcy usług i inne osoby trzecie (takie jak Google i inni partnerzy reklamowi) możemy wykorzystywać informacje, które gromadzimy na temat użytkownika (bezpośrednio z Witryn lub od osób trzecich) w celu rozpoznawania użytkownika online poprzez identyfikację Urządzeń, z których korzysta. Używamy tych informacji do wyświetlania [ukierunkowanych reklam](#targetedadvertising-polish) na wielu różnych Urządzeniach („dopasowywanie na różnych urządzeniach”) i w witrynach („śledzenie w różnych witrynach”). Dopasowywanie na różnych urządzeniach i śledzenie w różnych witrynach pozwalają nam lepiej zrozumieć aktywność naszych klientów, poprawić możliwości kierowania kampaniami reklamowych i ich pomiaru (w tym ograniczyć liczbę wyświetleń danej reklamy przez użytkownika). Pomaga to nam również dopasować Urządzenia, dzięki czemu możemy ułatwić rezygnację z wyrażenia zgody przez użytkownika na wszystkich Urządzeniach, o których wiemy, że są połączone z plikiem cookie, z którego użytkownik zrezygnował.

**Wyłączanie plików cookie i rezygnacja z reklam opartych na zainteresowaniach**

Użytkownik może dokonywać wyborów dotyczących otrzymywania plików cookie za pomocą naszego [Centrum preferencji dotyczących prywatności](#). Usunięcie i/lub wyłączenie plików cookie witryny internetowej powinno być również możliwe za pomocą ustawień przeglądarki. Więcej informacji na temat usuwania plików cookie w przeglądarce internetowej można znaleźć w instrukcjach przeglądarek: [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en),  [Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies), [Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4468242/microsoft-edge-browsing-data-and-privacy), [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/clear-cookies-and-site-data-firefox), [Opera](https://help.opera.com/en/latest/web-preferences/#cookies), Safari ([Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac), [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265), [iPad](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265), or [iPod touch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265)).

Jeśli użytkownik zdecyduje się wyłączyć pliki cookie, Witryny mogą nie działać w ten sam sposób. Niektóre pliki cookie są niezbędne do rejestrowania i zapamiętują wybory użytkownika w odniesieniu do rezygnacji z kontaktu lub dodawania innych rodzajów plików cookie do Urządzenia użytkownika. Jeśli użytkownik usunie pliki cookie z komputera, plik cookie używany do rozpoznawania jego preferencji, w tym Reklamy opartej na zainteresowaniach, również zostanie usunięty, co wymaga ponownego dokonania wyboru.

Użytkownicy mogą również zrezygnować z korzystania z zewnętrznych sieci reklamowych za pośrednictwem witryn internetowych różnych stowarzyszeń branżowych, takich jak:

* Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) — [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/)
* Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) — (i) cały świat: [https://optout.aboutads.info/](https://optout.aboutads.info/); (ii) Europa: [http://youronlinechoices.eu/](http://youronlinechoices.eu/)

Rezygnacja z Reklamy opartej na zainteresowaniach spowoduje rezygnację z dostarczania przez te firmy treści lub reklam opartych na zainteresowaniach, ale nie oznacza to, że użytkownik nie będzie już otrzymywać żadnych reklam za pośrednictwem naszej witryny internetowej lub innych witryn internetowych. Użytkownik może nadal widzieć reklamy Honeywell, ale nie będą one dostosowywane do jego potrzeb przez firmę Honeywell lub naszych partnerów. Jeśli w dowolnym momencie użytkownik zdecyduje, że nie chce, aby jego dane osobowe były wykorzystywane w celu umożliwienia stronom trzecim wyświetlania reklam lub personalizacji wyświetlanych reklam, może również dostosować swoje ustawienia za pomocą narzędzi dostarczonych przez osoby trzecie, takie jak Google, Facebook i LinkedIn.

**Funkcja Do not track (Nie śledź/Bez śledzenia)**

Niektóre przeglądarki internetowe mogą przesyłać sygnały „nie śledź/bez śledzenia” do Witryn, z którymi użytkownik się komunikuje. W związku z tym, że przeglądarki zawierają i aktywują tę funkcję na różne sposoby, nie zawsze wiadomo, czy użytkownicy zamierzają przekazywać takie sygnały, a nawet czy w ogóle o nich wiedzą. Nie możemy podejmować działań w odpowiedzi na te sygnały. Użytkownik może również wyłączyć niektóre działania dotyczące śledzenia (np. wyłączenie plików cookie), a także zrezygnować z reklamy ukierunkowanej, postępując zgodnie z instrukcjami zawartymi w sekcji „[Wyłączanie plików cookie i rezygnacja z reklam opartych na zainteresowaniach](#disablingcookies-polish)”.

W razie jakichkolwiek pytań dotyczących wykorzystania przez nas plików cookie prosimy o kontakt pod adresem [Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com](mailto:Honeywellprivacy@honeywell.com).

Quando volta a visitar os nossos Sites, as nossas tecnologias ligam-se automaticamente ao Cookie para identificar o utilizador ou o seu Dispositivo e recuperar informações sobre si, tais como a sua preferência de idioma ou informações de início de sessão. Utilizamos também cookies de terceiros, que são cookies de um domínio diferente do domínio do website que está a visitar e que permitem a nós, ao terceiro proprietário dos cookies e, em alguns casos, a outros participantes em redes de cookies, identificar o utilizador ou o seu Dispositivo ao visitar diferentes websites. Utilizamos a palavra "Cookies" para incluir uma porção de texto, píxeis, gifs limpos, ficheiros de registo, web beacons ou outra tecnologia semelhante de rastreamento que são colocados nos seus Dispositivos.

**Existem quatro tipos de cookies que podemos utilizar:**

* **Cookies estritamente necessários** são necessários para o funcionamento dos nossos Sites e para lhe fornecer os serviços e as informações que nos solicitou. Os cookies estritamente necessários estão isentos do requisito de consentimento.
* **Cookies funcionais** permitem uma melhor funcionalidade e personalização. Por exemplo, permitem que os nossos Sites memorizem informações que o utilizador faculta, como preferências de idioma, e armazenar informações técnicas úteis para as suas interações com os nossos Sites. Podem ser estabelecidos por nós ou por fornecedores terceiros cujos serviços adicionámos aos nossos Sites.  Se não permitir estes cookies, alguns ou todos estes serviços poderão não funcionar corretamente.
* **Cookies de desempenho** recolhem informações sobre a sua utilização dos nossos Sites (por exemplo, permite-nos contabilizar as visitas e as origens de tráfego) e ajudam-nos a conhecer o desempenho dos nossos Sites, para que possamos fazer melhorias relevantes que otimizariam a sua experiência de navegação (por exemplo, permite-nos saber quais são as páginas mais e as menos populares). Todas as informações que estes cookies recolhem são agregadas e, portanto, anónimas.
* **Cookies de publicidade/segmentação** recolhem dados sobre a sua atividade online e identificam os seus interesses, para que possamos criar um perfil para si e fornecer-lhe publicidade mais relevante. Também desempenham funções como impedir que os mesmos anúncios reapareçam continuamente, assegurar que os anúncios são devidamente apresentados, e selecionar anúncios que se baseiam nos seus interesses.

Para mais informações sobre os Cookies que a Honeywell utiliza, visite o nosso [Centro de Preferências de Privacidade](#)**.**

**Por que motivo utilizamos Cookies e outras tecnologias semelhantes?**

Utilizamos Cookies e outras tecnologias semelhantes de rastreio para os seguintes fins:

*  Armazenar as suas preferências e definições;
* Permitir ao utilizador iniciar sessão e ser autenticado para que possa aceder aos nossos Sites e passar de página em página nos nossos Sites;
* Proteger os nossos Sites, incluindo deteção e prevenção de fraudes;
* Adaptar as informações que lhe são apresentadas com base nas suas preferências de navegação, tais como o idioma e a região geográfica;
* Monitorizar os padrões de tráfego dos utilizadores nos nossos Sites e recolher estatísticas relativas à utilização do website para nos ajudar a compreender o desempenho dos nossos Sites e como podemos melhorar os nossos Sites para efeitos de melhoria da sua experiência de navegação e fornecer serviços que sejam mais relevantes para si;
* Fornecer-nos informações comerciais e de marketing;
* Rastrear os utilizadores que visitam, interagem ou utilizam qualquer um dos nossos Sites, páginas de redes sociais, anúncios online e comunicações de marketing (como quais os anúncios em que clicou ou se um utilizador abriu ou reencaminhou um e-mail que lhe enviámos); e
* [Publicidade Direcionada](#targetedadvertising-portuguese); e
* [Rastreio entre dispositivos e sites](#crossdevice-portuguese).

**Quem utiliza as informações armazenadas em Cookies e tecnologias de rastreio semelhantes?**

As informações armazenadas nos Cookies dos nossos Sites são utilizadas exclusivamente por nós (ou por terceiros a agir em nosso nome), com exceção dos Cookies de terceiros que são utilizados e geridos por entidades externas para fornecer serviços solicitados por nós para melhorar os nossos serviços e a sua experiência na navegação dos nossos Sites. Para obter mais informações sobre os cookies originais e de terceiros que a Honeywell utiliza, visite o nosso [Centro de Preferências de Privacidade](#)**.**

**E quanto aos Flash Cookies ou Objetos de Partilha Local (Local Shared Objects)?**  
  
Podemos utilizar Flash Cookies ou Objetos de Partilha Local ("Flash LSOs") para armazenar as preferências do seu website, personalizar a sua visita, prevenir fraudes e para outras operações do website. Se não quiser Flash LSOs armazenados no computador, pode ajustar as definições do Flash Player para bloquear o armazenamento de Flash LSOs com as ferramentas contidas no Painel de Definições de Armazenamento de Websites. Também pode controlar os Flash LSOs ao aceder ao Painel de Definições de Armazenamento Global e seguir as instruções (que podem incluir explicações, por exemplo, sobre como eliminar os Flash LSOs existentes).

**Publicidade Direcionada**

Rastreamos e analisamos tanto a utilização individualizada como a informação estatística agregada relacionada com a sua utilização dos nossos Sites. Também estabelecemos parcerias com terceiros (tais como anunciantes e parceiros de publicidade) para apresentar publicidade nos nossos Sites e para gerir e apresentar publicidade noutros sites de terceiros. Estes terceiros utilizam cookies e tecnologias de rastreio semelhantes para recolher e utilizar certas informações sobre as suas atividades online, quer nos nossos Sites, quer noutros sites de terceiros, para avaliar e rastrear a eficácia dos anúncios e das nossas atividades de marketing online (por exemplo, ao recolher dados sobre quantas vezes clica num dos nossos anúncios). Estas informações podem ser utilizadas isoladamente ou em combinação com informações sobre si que obtemos de outras origens (como os nossos parceiros de dados), os seus dados de contacto e o histórico de transações da Honeywell para inferir os seus interesses e apresentar-lhe anúncios e marketing direcionados que são mais adaptados com base nas suas atividades de navegação e interesses inferidos ("Publicidade Baseada em Interesses"). Esta Publicidade Baseada em Interesses só será apresentada quando permitido pela lei aplicável e de acordo com as suas preferências de publicidade/marketing. Tenha em atenção que as tecnologias e os cookies de outros terceiros são regulamentados pela política de privacidade específica de cada empresa e não por este Aviso de Cookies.

**Rastreio entre dispositivos e sites**

Nós, os nossos fornecedores de serviços e outros terceiros (como a Google e outros parceiros de publicidade) podemos utilizar informações que recolhemos sobre o utilizador (quer diretamente dos nossos Sites ou de terceiros) para efeitos de reconhecimento online, ao identificar os Dispositivos que este utiliza. Utilizamos estas informações para lhe apresentar [publicidade direcionada](#targetedadvertising-portuguese) através de vários Dispositivos diferentes ("correspondência entre dispositivos") e sites ("rastreio entre sites"). A correspondência entre dispositivos e o rastreio entre sites permitem-nos compreender melhor a atividade do nosso cliente, melhorar a nossa capacidade de direcionar e avaliar campanhas publicitárias (incluindo a limitação do número de vezes que um utilizador vê um anúncio). Ajuda-nos também a corresponder Dispositivos para que possamos facilitar as suas escolhas de opção de exclusão em todos os Dispositivos que sabemos estarem associados a um cookie desativado.

**Desativação de cookies e exclusão de Publicidade Baseada em Interesses**

Pode fazer escolhas sobre a receção de cookies ao utilizar o nosso [Centro de Preferências de Privacidade](#) ou, em alternativa, as definições do seu browser devem permitir-lhe eliminar e/ou desativar os cookies dos websites. Para obter mais informações sobre como eliminar os cookies no browser, consulte as instruções do seu browser: [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=pt),  [Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/pt-pt/windows/eliminar-e-gerir-cookies-168dab11-0753-043d-7c16-ede5947fc64d), [Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/pt-pt/windows/microsoft-edge-dados-de-navega%25C3%25A7%25C3%25A3o-e-privacidade-bb8174ba-9d73-dcf2-9b4a-c582b4e640dd), [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/pt-PT/kb/limpar-cookies-e-dados-de-site-no-firefox), [Opera,](https://help.opera.com/en/latest/web-preferences/#cookies) Safari ([Mac](https://support.apple.com/pt-pt/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac), [iPhone, iPad ou iPod touch](https://support.apple.com/pt-pt/HT201265)).

Se optar por desativar os cookies, poderá encontrar Sites que talvez não funcionem da mesma forma. Alguns cookies são necessários para registar e respeitar as escolhas efetuadas em relação a não entrarem em contacto consigo ou a não ter outros tipos de cookies adicionados ao seu Dispositivo. Se eliminar cookies do computador, o cookie utilizado para reconhecer as suas preferências, incluindo a Publicidade Baseada em Interesses, também será eliminado, o que requer que efetue novamente as suas escolhas.

Os utilizadores também podem optar pela exclusão de redes de anúncios de terceiros através da utilização de vários websites de associações comerciais, tais como:

* Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) - [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/)
* Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) – (i) Global: [https://optout.aboutads.info/](https://optout.aboutads.info/); (ii) Europa: [http://youronlinechoices.eu/](http://youronlinechoices.eu/)

A exclusão da Publicidade Baseada em Interesses irá excluir o utilizador do fornecimento de conteúdos ou anúncios baseados em interesses por parte destas empresas, mas não significa que deixará de receber qualquer publicidade através do nosso website ou de outros websites. Poderá ainda ver anúncios da Honeywell, mas esses anúncios não serão personalizados pela Honeywell ou pelos nossos parceiros. Se, em qualquer altura, não quiser que as suas informações pessoais sejam utilizadas para permitir a apresentação de anúncios por terceiros ou para personalizar os anúncios que lhe são apresentados, poderá também ajustar as definições ao utilizar as ferramentas disponibilizadas por terceiros, como Google, Facebook e LinkedIn.

**Não Monitorizar (Do Not Track - DNT)**

Alguns browsers podem transmitir sinais "não monitorizar" aos Sites com os quais comunica. Devido a diferenças na forma como os browsers incorporam e ativam esta funcionalidade, nem sempre é claro se os utilizadores pretendem que estes sinais sejam transmitidos ou se estão cientes dos mesmos.  Podemos não agir em resposta a estes sinais. Pode também desativar certos rastreios (por exemplo, ao desativar cookies) e pode também optar por não receber publicidade direcionada ao seguir as instruções na secção [Desativação de cookies e exclusão de Publicidade Baseada em Interesses](#disablingcookies-portuguese).

Această Notificare privind modulele cookie descrie modul în care Honeywell International Inc. și filialele sale (în mod colectiv "**Honeywell**","**noi**"sau"**noi**") utilizează module cookie și tehnologii similare instalate pe dispozitive precum un computer, dispozitiv mobil sau tabletă ("**Dispozitive**") ale vizitatorilor sau utilizatorilor site-ului nostru web, a produselor și/sau aplicațiilor ("**de pe site-uri**").

Cookie-urile și tehnologiile similare pot prelucra informații personale. Vă rugăm vizitați:

**Ce sunt cookie-urile?**

Cookie-urile sunt fișiere text mici pe care site-urile noastre le plasează pe dispozitivele dvs. Când vizitați din nou site-urile noastre, tehnologiile noastre se conectează automat cu modulul cookie pentru a vă identifica pe dvs. sau dispozitivul dvs. și pentru a vă reaminti informații despre dvs., cum ar fi preferința de limbă sau informațiile de conectare. De asemenea, folosim module cookie de la terți. care sunt module cookie dintr-un domeniu diferit de domeniul site-ului web pe care îl vizitați, care ne permit nouă, terței părți care deține modulele cookie și, în unele cazuri, altor participanți la rețelele cookie să vă identifice pe dvs. sau dispozitivul dvs. în timp ce vizitați diferite site-uri web. Folosim cuvântul „Cookie-uri” pentru a include o bucată de text, pixeli, gif-uri clare, fișiere de tip jurnal, semnalizatoare web sau alte tehnologii similare de urmărire care sunt plasate pe dispozitivele dvs.

**Există patru tipuri de module cookie pe care le putem folosi:**

* **Module cookie strict necesare** sunt necesare pentru ca site-urile noastre să funcționeze și să vă ofere serviciile și informațiile pe care le-ați solicitat. Cookie-urile strict necesare sunt scutite de cerința de consimțământ.
* **Module cookie funcționale** permit funcționalitate și personalizare îmbunătățite. De exemplu, acestea permit site-urilor noastre să-și amintească informațiile pe care le furnizați, cum ar fi preferințele dvs. de limbă și să stocheze informații tehnice utile pentru interacțiunile dvs. cu site-urile noastre. Acestea pot fi setate de noi sau de furnizori terți ale căror servicii le-am adăugat la site-urile noastre.  Dacă nu permiteți aceste cookie-uri, este posibil ca unele sau toate aceste servicii să nu funcționeze corect.
* **Module cookie de performanță** colectează informații despre utilizarea site-urilor noastre (de exemplu, ne permite să numărăm vizitele și sursele de trafic) și ne ajută să aflăm cum funcționează site-urile noastre, astfel încât să putem face modificări relevante care ar putea îmbunătăți experiența dvs. de navigare (de exemplu, ne permite să știți ce pagini sunt cele mai populare și cele mai puțin populare). Toate informațiile pe care aceste module cookie le colectează sunt agregate și, prin urmare, anonime.
* **Module cookie de publicitate/direcționare** colectează date despre activitatea dvs. online și vă identifică interesele, astfel încât să putem crea un profil pentru dvs. și să vă oferim o publicitate care este mai relevantă pentru dvs. De asemenea, acestea îndeplinesc funcții precum prevenirea reapariției continue a acelorași anunțuri, asigurarea afișării corespunzătoare a anunțurilor și selectarea anunțurilor care se bazează pe interesele dvs.

Pentru mai multe informații despre modulele cookie pe care Honeywell le folosește, vă rugăm să vizitați site-ul nostru [Centrul de preferințe pentru confidențialitate](#).

**De ce folosim module cookies alte tehnologii similare?**

Folosim module cookie și alte tehnologii similare de urmărire în următoarele scopuri:

* Să stocăm preferințele și setările dvs.;
* Să vă permitem să vă conectați și să vă autentificați astfel încât să puteți accesa site-urile noastre și să vă deplasați de la o pagină la alta în cadrul site-urilor noastre;
* Să securizăm site-urile noastre, inclusiv detectarea și prevenirea fraudei;
* Să personalizăm informațiile pe care vi le prezentăm în funcție de preferințele dvs. de navigare, cum ar fi limba și regiunea geografică;
* Să monitorizăm obiceiurile de trafic ale utilizatorilor din site-urile noastre și să colectăm statistici privind utilizarea de către dvs. a site-ului web pentru a ne ajuta să înțelegem cum funcționează site-urile noastre și cum le putem îmbunătăți în scopuri precum îmbunătățirea experienței dvs. de navigare și oferirea de servicii care sunt mai relevante pentru dvs.;
* Să ne furnizați informații de afaceri și de marketing;
* Să urmărim utilizatorii care vizitează, interacționează cu sau utilizează oricare dintre site-urile noastre, paginile de socializare, reclamele online și comunicările de marketing (cum ar fi anunțurile pe care s-a făcut clic sau dacă un utilizator a deschis sau redirecționat un e-mail pe care l-am trimis); și
* [Publicitate orientată specific](#targetedadvertising-rom); și
* [Urmărire pe mai multe dispozitive și pe mai multe site-uri](#crossdevice-rom).

**Cine folosește informațiile stocate în modulele cookie și tehnologii similare de urmărire?**

Informațiile stocate în modulele cookie ale site-urilor noastre sunt utilizate exclusiv de noi (sau de terți care acționează în numele nostru), cu excepția modulelor cookie terțe care sunt utilizate și gestionate de părți externe pentru a furniza servicii solicitate de noi pentru a ne îmbunătăți serviciile și experiența dvs. atunci când navigați pe site-urile noastre. Pentru mai multe informații despre modulele cookie primare și ale terțelor părți pe care le folosește Honeywell vă rugăm să vizitați site-ul nostru [Centrul de preferințe pentru confidențialitate.](#)

**Dar modulele cookie Flash sau obiectele partajate locale?**  
  
Putem folosi module cookie Flash sau obiecte partajate locale („LSO-uri Flash”) pentru a stoca preferințele site-ului dvs. web, a vă personaliza vizita, a preveni frauda și pentru alte operațiuni ale site-ului. Dacă nu doriți ca LSO-urile Flash să fie stocate pe computerul dvs., puteți ajusta setările Flash player-ului dvs. pentru a bloca stocarea Flash LSO-urilor folosind instrumentele conținute în Panoul de setări pentru stocarea site-urilor web. De asemenea, puteți controla LSO-urile Flash accesând Panoul de setări pentru stocare globală și urmând instrucțiunile (care pot include instrucțiuni care explică, de exemplu, cum să ștergeți LSO-urile Flash existente).

**Publicitate orientată specific**

Urmărim și analizăm atât utilizarea individualizată, cât și informațiile statistice agregate legate de utilizarea site-urilor noastre. De asemenea, colaborăm cu terțe părți (cum ar fi agenții de publicitate și parteneri publicitari) pentru a afișa reclame pe site-urile noastre și pentru a gestiona și difuza reclame pe alte site-uri ale terțelor părți. Aceste terțe părți utilizează module cookie și tehnologii similare de urmărire pentru a colecta și utiliza anumite informații despre activitățile dvs. online, fie pe site-urile noastre sau pe alte site-uri ale terțelor părți pentru a măsura și urmări eficacitatea reclamelor și a activităților noastre de marketing online (de exemplu, prin colectarea de date de câte ori faceți clic pe una dintre reclamele noastre). Aceste informații pot fi folosite singure sau în combinație cu informații despre dvs. pe care le obținem din alte surse (cum ar fi partenerii noștri de date), detaliile dvs. de contact și istoricul tranzacțiilor Honeywell pentru a deduce interesele dvs. și pentru a vă oferi reclame și marketing orientate mai mult spre dvs. pe baza activităților dvs. de navigare și a intereselor deduse („Publicitate bazată pe interese”). O astfel de publicitate bazată pe interese va fi livrată numai acolo unde este permis de legislația aplicabilă și în conformitate cu preferințele dvs. de publicitate/marketing. Vă rugăm să rețineți că modulele cookie și tehnologiile altor terțe părți sunt guvernate de politica de confidențialitate specifică fiecărei companii și nu de această Notificare privind modulele cookie.

**Urmărire pe mai multe dispozitive și pe mai multe site-uri**

Noi, furnizorii noștri de servicii și alte terțe părți (cum ar fi Google și alți parteneri publicitari) putem folosi informațiile pe care le colectăm despre dvs. (fie direct de pe site-urile noastre sau de la o terță parte) în scopul recunoașterii dvs. online prin identificarea dispozitivelor pe care le utilizați. Folosim aceste informații pentru a vă oferi [publicitate direcționată](#targetedadvertising-rom) pe mai multe dispozitive diferite („potrivire pe mai multe dispozitive”) și site-uri („urmărire pe mai multe site-uri”). Potrivirea pe mai multe dispozitive și urmărirea pe mai multe site-uri ne permite să înțelegem mai bine activitatea clienților noștri, să ne îmbunătățim capacitatea de a viza specific și măsura campaniile publicitare (inclusiv limitarea numărului de câte ori un utilizator vede o reclamă).

В настоящем Уведомлении о файлах cookie описывается, как Honeywell International Inc. и ее аффилированные лица (далее в совокупности именуемые (**"Honeywell", "мы", "нас"**) используют файлы cookie и аналогичные технологии, установленные на устройствах, таких как компьютер, мобильное устройство или планшет (**"Устройства"**), посетителей или пользователей нашего веб-сайта, продуктов и (или) приложений (**"Веб-сайты"**).

Файлы cookie и аналогичные технологии могут обрабатывать персональные данные. Вы можете посетить:

* веб-сайт с нашим [Заявлением о конфиденциальности](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/privacy-statement#russian), если вам необходимы дополнительные сведения о том, как мы обрабатываем персональные данные и как вы можете воспользоваться своими правами субъекта данных:
* наш [Центр настроек конфиденциальности](#) для получения дополнительной информации об используемых на наших Веб-сайтах конкретных файлах cookie и для управления своими настройками файлов cookie.

**Что такое файлы cookie?**

Файлы cookie — это небольшие текстовые файлы, которые наши Веб-сайты размещают на ваших устройствах. При повторном посещении наших Веб-сайтов наши технологии автоматически подключаются к файлам cookie, чтобы идентифицировать вас или ваше устройство и восстановить информацию о вас, например о ваших языковых предпочтениях или данных для входа. Мы также используем сторонние файлы cookie, которые представляют собой файлы cookie из домена, отличного от домена веб-сайта, который вы посещаете, что позволяет нам, третьей стороне, которой принадлежат эти файлы cookie, а в некоторых случаях и другим участникам сетей файлов cookie идентифицировать вас или ваше устройство при посещении вами разных веб-сайтов. Под словом cookie мы понимаем фрагменты текста, пиксели, прозрачные GIF-файлы, файлы журналов, веб-маяки или другие подобные технологии отслеживания, которые размещаются на ваших устройствах.

**Мы можем использовать четыре типа файлов cookie.**

* **Строго необходимые файлы cookie** необходимы для работы наших Веб-сайтов и предоставления вам запрашиваемых вами услуг и информации. Строго необходимые файлы cookie не требуют согласия для их использования.
* **Функциональные файлы cookie** обеспечивают расширенную функциональность и персонализацию. Например, эти файлы позволяют хранить информацию, предоставляемую вами, например настройки языка и техническую информацию, полезную для вашего взаимодействия с нашими Веб-сайтами. Они могут быть установлены нами или сторонними поставщиками, чьи услуги мы добавили на наши Веб-сайты. Если вы не разрешите использование этих файлов cookie, некоторые или все эти службы могут работать некорректно.
* **Файлы cookie, отвечающие за производительность**, собирают информацию об использовании вами наших Веб-сайтов (например, это позволяет нам подсчитывать посещения и источники трафика) и помогают нам узнавать, как работают наши Веб-сайты, чтобы мы могли вносить соответствующие улучшения, которые могут повысить для вас удобство работы с Веб-сайтами (например, это позволяет нам узнавать, какие страницы являются наиболее и наименее популярными). Вся информация, собираемая этими файлами cookie, является сводной и, следовательно, анонимной.
* **Рекламные/целевые файлы cookie** собирают данные о вашей онлайн-активности и определяют ваши интересы, чтобы мы могли создать для вас профиль и предоставлять более актуальную для вас рекламу. Они также выполняют такие функции, как предотвращение постоянного повторения одних и тех же рекламных объявлений, обеспечение правильного отображения рекламы и выбор рекламных объявлений, основанных на ваших интересах.

Для получения дополнительных сведений о файлах cookie, используемых компанией Honeywell, посетите наш [Центр настроек конфиденциальности](#).

**Почему мы используем файлы cookie и другие подобные технологии?**

Мы используем файлы cookie и другие подобные технологии отслеживания для следующих целей:

* сохранение ваших предпочтений и настроек;
* предоставление возможности входа в систему и аутентификации, чтобы вы могли получать доступ к нашим Веб-сайтам и переходить со страницы на страницу на наших Веб-сайтах;
* обеспечение безопасности наших Веб-сайтов, включая обнаружение и предотвращение мошенничества;
* адаптация предоставляемой вам информации на основе ваших предпочтений, таких как язык и географический регион;
* отслеживание моделей трафика пользователей на наших Веб-сайтах и сбор статистических данных об использовании вами наших Веб-сайтов для получения представления о том, как работают наши Веб-сайты и как мы можем улучшить их работу для того, чтобы улучшить ваше взаимодействие с нашими Веб-сайтами и предлагать вам наиболее подходящие услуги;
* предоставление нам деловой и маркетинговой информации;
* отслеживание пользователей, посещающих или использующих наши Веб-сайты, страницы в социальных сетях, онлайн-рекламу и маркетинговые материалы (например, по каким рекламным объявлениям был выполнен переход либо открыл ли или переслал ли пользователь электронное письмо, которое мы ему отправили);
* [таргетирование рекламы](#targetedadvertising-russian);
* [отслеживание пользователей, использующих разные устройства и разные веб-сайты](#crossdevice-russian).

**Кто использует информацию, хранящуюся в файлах cookie и аналогичных технологиях отслеживания?**

Информация, хранящаяся в файлах cookie наших Веб-сайтов, используется исключительно нами (или третьими лицами, действующими от нашего имени), за исключением сторонних файлов cookie, которые используются и управляются внешними сторонами для предоставления услуг, запрошенных нами для улучшения наших услуг и вашего опыта навигации по нашим Веб-сайтам. Для получения дополнительных сведений о наших и сторонних файлах cookie, используемых компанией Honeywell, посетите наш [Центр настроек конфиденциальности](#).

**Как обстоит дело с Flash-файлами cookie или локальными общими объектами (Local Shared Objects)?**

Мы можем использовать Flash-файлы cookie или локальные общие объекты (Flash LSO) для хранения ваших настроек веб-сайтов, персонализации ваших посещений веб-сайтов, предотвращения мошенничества и для других операций на веб-сайтах. Если вы не хотите, чтобы файлы Flash LSO хранились на вашем компьютере, вы можете настроить параметры проигрывателя Flash таким образом, чтобы блокировать хранение Flash LSO с помощью инструментов, содержащихся на панели параметров хранения данных веб-сайтов. Вы также можете управлять Flash LSO, перейдя на панель Глобальные параметры хранения» и следуя инструкциям (которые могут включать инструкции, объясняющие, например, как удалить существующие Flash LSO).

**Таргетированная реклама**

Мы отслеживаем и анализируем как индивидуальное использование, так и агрегированную статистическую информацию, связанную с использованием вами наших Веб-сайтов. Мы также сотрудничаем с третьими сторонами (такими как рекламодатели и партнеры по рекламе) для показа рекламы на наших Веб-сайтах, а также для управления и показа рекламы на сторонних веб-сайтах. Эти третьи лица используют файлы cookie и аналогичные технологии отслеживания для сбора и использования определенной информации о ваших действиях в Интернете, на наших Веб-сайтах либо на других сторонних сайтах для измерения и отслеживания эффективности рекламы и нашей маркетинговой деятельности в Интернете (например, путем сбора данных о том, сколько раз вы нажимаете на одно из наших рекламных объявлений). Эта информация может использоваться отдельно или в сочетании с информацией о вас, которую мы получаем из других источников (таких как наши партнеры по обработке данных), вашими контактными данными и историей транзакций Honeywell, чтобы определять ваши интересы и предоставлять вам целевую рекламу и маркетинг, ориентированные на вас на основе ваших действий в Интернете и предполагаемых интересов (Реклама на основе интересов). Такая реклама на основе интересов будет предоставляться только в том случае, если это разрешено действующим законодательством, а также в соответствии с вашими рекламными / маркетинговыми предпочтениями. Обратите внимание на то, что файлы cookie и технологии третьих лиц регулируются политикой конфиденциальности конкретной компании, а не настоящим Уведомлением о файлах cookie.

**Отслеживание пользователей, использующих разные устройства и разные веб-сайты**

Мы, наши поставщики услуг и другие третьи лица (такие как Google и другие партнеры по рекламе) можем использовать собираемые нами данные (напрямую с наших Веб-сайтов или от третьих лиц) для того, чтобы узнавать вас в Интернете, идентифицируя устройства, которые вы используете. Мы используем эту информацию, чтобы показывать вам [таргетированную рекламу](#targetedadvertising-russian) на разных устройствах (отслеживание разных устройств) и сайтах (отслеживание на разных сайтах). Отслеживание разных устройств и отслеживание на разных сайтах позволяет нам лучше понимать активность наших клиентов, улучшать наши возможности таргетинга и измерения рекламных кампаний (включая ограничение количества показов рекламы). Это также помогает нам сопоставлять устройства, чтобы в случае вашего отказа от использования файлов cookie мы могли отключить их на всех ваших устройствах, на которых используются такие файлы.

**Отключение файлов cookie и отказ от рекламы на основе интересов**

Вы можете настроить применение файлов cookie в нашем [Центре настроек конфиденциальности](#) либо настройки вашего браузера должны позволять вам удалять и (или) отключать файлы cookie веб-сайтов. Дополнительные сведения о том, как удалить файлы cookie в вашем веб-браузере, см. в инструкциях вашего браузера: [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en), [Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies), [Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4468242/microsoft-edge-browsing-data-and-privacy), [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/clear-cookies-and-site-data-firefox), [Opera](https://help.opera.com/en/latest/web-preferences/#cookies), Safari ([Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac), [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265), [iPad или iPod touch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265)).

Если вы решите отключить файлы cookie, вы можете столкнуться с изменениями в работе Веб-сайтов. Некоторые файлы cookie необходимы для сохранения и соблюдения ваших предпочтений, касающихся отказа от отправки вам сообщений или добавления других типов файлов cookie на ваше устройство. Если вы удалите файлы cookie со своего компьютера, файлы cookie, используемые для распознавания ваших предпочтений, в том числе в отношении рекламы на основе интересов, также будут удалены, и вам придется снова указывать свои предпочтения.

Пользователи также могут отказаться от услуг сторонних рекламных сетей, используя веб-сайты различных отраслевых ассоциаций, такие как:

* Network Advertising Initiative (Инициатива по рекламе в сети Интернет) — [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/)
* Digital Advertising alliance (Альянс цифровой рекламы, DAA)) — (i) глобальный веб-сайт: [https://optout.aboutads.info/](https://optout.aboutads.info/); (ii) Европа: [http://youronlinechoices.eu/](http://youronlinechoices.eu/)

После отказа от рекламы на основе интересов эти компании не будут предоставлять вам контент или рекламу на основе интересов, но это не означает, что вы больше не будете видеть рекламу на наших и других веб-сайтах. Вы по-прежнему будете видеть рекламу компании Honeywell, но она не будет адаптирована для вас компанией Honeywell или нашими партнерами. Если вы захотите, чтобы ваши персональные данные не использовались для показа или персонализации рекламы третьими лицами, вы можете изменить свои настройки с помощью инструментов, предоставляемых такими третьими лицами, например Google, Facebook и LinkedIn.

**Не отслеживать (DNT)**

Некоторые браузеры могут передавать сигналы о запрете на сбор информации о пользователе (Do Not Track) на Веб-сайты, с которыми он взаимодействует. Из-за различий в способах включения и активации этой функции в браузерах не всегда понятно, действительно ли пользователи хотят передать этот сигнал и знают ли они вообще о существовании такой возможности. Мы не можем действовать в ответ на эти сигналы. Вы также можете отключить отслеживание (например отключив файлы cookie) и отказаться от целевой рекламы, следуя инструкциям в разделе [Отключение файлов cookie и отказ от рекламы на основе интересов](#disablingcookies-russian).

* naše [Centrum preferencií ochrany súkromia](#) pre viac informácií o konkrétnych súboroch cookie, ktoré používame na našich webových lokalitách, a pre správu svojich preferencií týkajúcich sa súborov cookie.

**Čo sú súbory cookie?**

Súbory cookie sú malé textové súbory, ktoré naše webové lokality umiestňujú do vašich zariadení. Keď opätovne navštívite naše webové lokality, naše technológie sa automaticky spoja so súborom cookie, aby identifikovali vás alebo vaše zariadenie a spomenuli si na informácie o vás, ako sú napríklad vaše preferencie týkajúce sa jazyka alebo prihlasovacie údaje. Používame tiež súbory cookie tretích strán. Sú to súbory cookie z inej domény ako je doména navštívenej webovej stránky, ktoré nám, tretej strane, ktorá vlastní súbory cookie, a v niektorých prípadoch iným účastníkom sietí súborov cookie, umožňujú identifikovať vás alebo vaše zariadenie pri návšteve rôznych webových stránok. Slová „súbory cookie“ používame na zahrnutie časti textu, pixelov, jasných súborov GIF, súborov denníka, webových signálov alebo iných podobných technológií sledovania, ktoré sú umiestnené na vašich zariadeniach.

**Existujú štyri typy súborov cookie, ktoré môžeme použiť:**

* **Striktne nevyhnutné súbory cookie** sú potrebné na to, aby naše stránky fungovali a poskytovali vám služby a informácie, ktoré požadujete. Striktne nevyhnutné súbory cookie sú vyňaté z požiadavky súhlasu.
* **Funkčné súbory cookie** umožňujú zlepšenú funkčnosť a personalizáciu. Napríklad umožňujú našim webovým lokalitám zapamätať si informácie, ktoré nám poskytnete, ako napríklad vaše preferencie týkajúce sa jazyka lokality, a ukladať technické údaje, ktoré sú užitočné na vaše interakcie s našimi webovými lokalitami. Môžu byť nastavené nami alebo poskytovateľmi tretích strán, ktorých služby sme pridali na naše webové lokality. Ak tieto súbory cookie nepovolíte, niektoré alebo všetky tieto služby nemusia fungovať správne.
* **Analytické súbory cookie** zhromažďujú informácie o vašom používaní našich webových lokalít (napr. umožňujú nám počítať návštevy a zdroje návštevnosti) a pomáhajú nám dozvedieť sa, ako fungujú naše webové lokality, aby sme mohli vykonať príslušné vylepšenia, ktoré by mohli zlepšiť váš zážitok z prehliadania (napr. umožňujú nám vedieť, ktoré stránky sú najobľúbenejšie a najmenej populárne). Všetky informácie, ktoré tieto súbory cookie zhromažďujú, sú agregované a teda anonymné.
* **Reklamné/cielené súbory cookie** zhromažďujú údaje o vašej online aktivite a identifikujú vaše záujmy, aby sme vám mohli vytvoriť profil a poskytovať reklamu, ktorá je pre vás relevantnejšia. Vykonávajú tiež funkcie, ako je zabránenie opakovanému zobrazovaniu rovnakých reklám, zaistenie správneho zobrazovania reklám a vyberanie reklám založených na vašich záujmoch.

Viac informácií o súboroch cookie, ktoré používa spoločnosť Honeywell, nájdete na našej webovej stránke [Centrum preferencií ochrany súkromia](#).

**Prečo používame súbory cookie a ďalšie podobné technológie?**

* uloženie vašich preferencií a nastavení;
* umožnenie vám prihlásiť sa a overiť vás, aby ste mali prístup na naše webové lokality a mohli sa v rámci našich webových lokalít pohybovať zo stránky na stránku;
* zabezpečenie našich webových lokalít vrátane detekcie a prevencie podvodov;
* prispôsobenie informácií, ktoré sa vám zobrazujú na základe vašich preferencií prehliadania, ako napríklad jazyk a geografická oblasť;
* monitorovanie vzorcov pohybu používateľov na našich webových lokalitách a zhromažďovanie štatistických údajov o používaní webových stránok, aby nám pomohli pochopiť, ako fungujú naše webové lokality a ako môžeme naše webové lokality vylepšiť na účely, ako napríklad vylepšenie vášho zážitku z prehliadania a ponúkanie služieb, ktoré sú pre vás relevantnejšie;
* poskytnutie nám obchodných a marketingových informácií;
* sledovanie používateľov, ktorí navštevujú naše webové lokality, stránky sociálnych médií, online reklamy a marketingové komunikácie, interagujú s nimi alebo ich používajú (ako napríklad reklamy, na ktoré klikli alebo či používateľ otvoril alebo preposlal e-mail, ktorý sme im poslali); a
* [cielenú reklamu](#targetedadvertising-slovak); a
* [sledovanie viacerých zariadení a viacerých stránok](#crossdevice-slovak).

**Kto používa informácie uložené v súboroch cookie a podobných technológiách sledovania?**

Informácie uložené v súboroch cookie našich webových lokalít používame výhradne my (alebo tretie strany konajúce v našom mene), s výnimkou súborov cookie tretích strán, ktoré používajú a spravujú externé strany, aby nám poskytovali nami požadované služby na zlepšenie našich služieb a vášho zážitku pri navigácii na našich lokalitách. Ďalšie informácie o súboroch cookie prvej a tretej strany, ktoré používa spoločnosť Honeywell, nájdete na našej stránke [Centrum preferencií ochrany súkromia](#).

**Čo napríklad súbory flash cookie alebo miestne zdieľané objekty?**

Môžeme použiť súbory flash cookie alebo miestne zdieľané objekty („Flash LSO“) na ukladanie preferencií vašich webových stránok, prispôsobenie vašej návštevy, zabránenie podvodom a na ďalšie operácie so stránkami. Ak nechcete, aby sa vo vašom počítači ukladali Flash LSO, môžete upraviť nastavenia prehrávača Flash tak, aby blokovalo ukladanie Flash LSO pomocou nástrojov obsiahnutých v paneli Nastavenia webového úložiska. Flash LSO môžete tiež ovládať tak, že prejdete na panel Nastavenia globálneho úložiska a budete postupovať podľa pokynov (ktoré môžu obsahovať pokyny, ktoré vysvetľujú napríklad odstránenie existujúcich Flash LSO).

**Cielená reklama**

Sledujeme a analyzujeme individualizované použitie a aj agregované štatistické informácie týkajúce sa vášho používania našich webových lokalít. Ďalej uzatvárame partnerstvá s tretími stranami (ako napríklad s inzerentmi a reklamnými partnermi), aby sme zobrazovali reklamu na našich webových lokalitách a spravovali a poskytovali reklamu na iných stránkach tretích strán. Tieto tretie strany používajú súbory cookie a podobné technológie sledovania na zhromažďovanie a používanie určitých informácií o vašich online aktivitách, či už na našich webových lokalitách alebo na iných stránkach tretích strán, na meranie a sledovanie efektívnosti reklám a našich online marketingových aktivít (napríklad zhromažďovaním údajov koľkokrát kliknete na niektorú z našich reklám). Tieto informácie môžu byť použité samostatne alebo v kombinácii s informáciami o vás, ktoré získavame z iných zdrojov (napríklad od našich dátových partnerov), vašimi kontaktnými údajmi a históriou transakcií spoločnosti Honeywell na vyvodenie vašich záujmov a doručenie cielených reklám a marketingu, ktoré sú pre vás viac prispôsobené na základe vašich aktivít prehliadania a odvodených záujmov („záujmovo orientovaná reklama“). Takáto záujmovo orientovaná reklama sa bude dodávať iba tam, kde to povoľujú príslušné zákony a v súlade s vašimi reklamnými/marketingovými preferenciami. Upozorňujeme, že súbory cookie a technológie tretích strán sa riadia konkrétnymi zásadami ochrany súkromia každej spoločnosti, a nie týmto oznámením o súboroch cookie.

**Sledovanie viacerých zariadení a viacerých stránok**

My, naši poskytovatelia služieb a ďalšie tretie strany (ako napríklad Google a ďalší reklamní partneri) môžeme použiť informácie, ktoré o vás zhromažďujeme (či už priamo z našich stránok alebo od tretej strany), na účely rozpoznať vás online identifikáciou zariadení, ktoré používate. Tieto informácie používame na to, aby sme vám poskytli [cielenú reklamu](#targetedadvertising-slovak) na viacerých rôznych zariadeniach („párovanie viacerých zariadení“) a stránkach („sledovanie viacerých stránok“). Párovanie viacerých zariadení a sledovanie viacerých stránok nám umožňuje lepšie pochopiť aktivitu našich zákazníkov, zlepšiť našu schopnosť zacieliť a merať reklamné kampane (vrátane obmedzenia počtu prípadov, keď sa používateľovi zobrazí reklama). Pomáha nám tiež párovať zariadenia, aby sme vám mohli uľahčiť vaše voľby odhlásenia na všetkých zariadeniach, o ktorých vieme, že sú pripojené k odhlásenému súboru cookie.

**Zakázanie súborov cookie a odhlásenie zo záujmovo orientovanej reklamy**

Ohľadom prijímania súborov cookie sa môžete rozhodnúť použitím nášho [Centra preferencií ochrany súkromia](#) alebo prípadne by vám mali nastavenia prehliadača umožniť odstránenie a/alebo zakázanie súborov cookie webových stránok. Ďalšie informácie o tom, ako odstrániť súbory cookie vo vašom webovom prehliadači, nájdete v pokynoch vášho prehliadača: [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en), [Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies), [Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4468242/microsoft-edge-browsing-data-and-privacy), [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/clear-cookies-and-site-data-firefox), [Opera](https://help.opera.com/en/latest/web-preferences/#cookies), Safari ([Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac), [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265), [iPad alebo iPod touch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265)).

Ak sa rozhodnete zakázať súbory cookie, môže sa stať, že webové lokality nebudú fungovať rovnakým spôsobom. Niektoré súbory cookie sú potrebné na zaznamenanie a rešpektovanie rozhodnutí, ktoré ste vykonali v súvislosti s tým, že vás nebudeme kontaktovať alebo že do vášho zariadenia nebudú pridané iné typy súborov cookie. Ak z počítača odstránite súbory cookie, odstránia sa aj súbory cookie, ktoré sa používajú na rozpoznanie vašich preferencií vrátane záujmovo orientovanej reklamy, čo od vás vyžaduje znova sa rozhodnúť.

Používatelia sa tiež môžu odhlásiť z reklamných sietí tretích strán pomocou použitia rôznych webových stránok obchodných združení, ako napríklad:

* Sieť Iniciatíva v oblasti reklamy (NAI) – [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/)
* Aliancia digitálnej reklamy (DAA) – (i) Celý svet: [https://optout.aboutads.info/](https://optout.aboutads.info/); (ii) Európa: [http://youronlinechoices.eu/](http://youronlinechoices.eu/)

Odhlásenie zo záujmovo orientovanej reklamy vás odhlási z doručovania záujmovo orientovaného obsahu alebo reklám od týchto spoločností, ale neznamená to, že už nebudete dostávať žiadnu reklamu prostredníctvom našich webových stránok alebo iných webových stránok. Stále sa vám môžu zobrazovať reklamy spoločnosti Honeywell, ale tieto reklamy vám spoločnosť Honeywell alebo naši partneri neprispôsobia. Ak kedykoľvek nebudete chcieť, aby boli vaše osobné údaje použité na umožnenie tretím stranám zobrazovať reklamy alebo prispôsobovať reklamy, ktoré sa vám zobrazujú, môžete svoje nastavenia upraviť aj pomocou nástrojov poskytovaných tretími stranami, ako sú napr. Google, Facebook a LinkedIn.

**Zákaz sledovania (DNT)**

Niektoré webové prehliadače môžu prenášať na webové lokality, s ktorými komunikujete, signály zakazujúce sledovanie. Z dôvodu rozdielov v spôsoboch, akými webové prehliadače integrujú a aktivujú túto funkciu, nie je vždy jasné, či používatelia chcú prenášať tieto signály alebo či o nich vôbec vedia. Na tieto signály nemusíme reagovať. Môžete tiež zakázať určité sledovanie (napr. zakázaním súborov cookie) a tiež sa môžete odhlásiť z cielenej reklamy postupovaním podľa pokynov v časti "[Zakázanie súborov cookie a odhlásenie zo záujmovo orientovanej reklamy](#disablingcookies-slovak)“.

Las cookies y las tecnologías similares pueden procesar información personal. Consulte:

* nuestra [Declaración de privacidad](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/privacy-statement#spanish) si quiere obtener más información sobre cómo procesamos su información personal y cómo ejercer sus derechos como persona interesada
* nuestro [Centro de preferencias de privacidad](#) para obtener más información sobre las cookies específicas que utilizamos en nuestros Sitios con el fin de gestionar sus preferencias de cookies.

**¿Qué son las cookies?**

Las cookies son pequeños archivos de texto que nuestros Sitios colocan en sus Dispositivos. Cuando vuelve a visitar nuestros Sitios, nuestras tecnologías se conectan automáticamente con la cookie para identificarlo a usted o a su Dispositivo y recordar su información, como sus preferencias de idioma o su información de acceso. También utilizamos cookies de terceros, que son cookies de un dominio distinto al dominio que usted está visitando, lo que nos permite a nosotros, al tercero que posee las cookies y, en algunos casos, a otros participantes en redes de cookies identificarlo a usted o a su Dispositivo al visitar distintas páginas web. Con la palabra "cookies" nos referimos a fragmentos de texto, píxeles, gifs transparentes, archivos de registro, contadores de visitantes u otras tecnologías similares de seguimiento que se colocan en su Dispositivo.

**Hay cuatro tipos de cookies que podemos utilizar:**

* **Cookies estrictamente necesarias** que son requeridas por nuestros Sitios para poder funcionar y proporcionarle los servicios e información que ha solicitado. Las cookies estrictamente necesarias están exentas del requisito de consentimiento.
* **Cookies funcionales** que permiten una funcionalidad y personalización mejoradas. Por ejemplo, permiten que nuestros Sitios recuerden información que nos proporciona, como sus preferencias de idioma, y que almacenen información útil para sus interacciones con nuestros Sitios. Las podemos establecer nosotros o los proveedores externos cuyos servicios hemos añadido a nuestros Sitios. Si no acepta estas cookies, puede que todos o algunos de estos servicios no funcionen correctamente.
* **Cookies de rendimiento** que recogen información sobre el uso que hace de nuestros Sitios (p. ej., nos permiten contabilizar las visitas y las fuentes de tráfico) y nos ayudan a descubrir cómo funcionan nuestros Sitios para poder realizar las mejoras pertinentes que podrían aumentar su experiencia de navegación (p. ej., nos permiten saber qué páginas son las más y menos populares). Toda la información que recopilan estas cookies es colectiva y, por lo tanto, anónima.
* **Cookies de publicidad/segmentación** que recogen datos sobre su actividad en línea e identifican sus intereses para que podamos crear un perfil para usted y proporcionarle anuncios más relevantes. También realizan acciones como prevenir que siempre le aparezcan los mismos anuncios, asegurar que los anuncios se muestran correctamente y seleccionar anuncios basados en sus intereses.

Para obtener más información sobre las cookies que Honeywell utiliza, visite nuestro [Centro de preferencias de privacidad](#).

**¿Por qué utilizamos cookies y otras tecnologías similares?**

Utilizamos cookies y otras tecnologías similares de seguimiento para los siguientes propósitos:

* Guardar sus preferencias y configuración;
* Permitir que inicie sesión y se autentique para que pueda acceder a nuestros Sitios y se pueda mover entre páginas dentro de nuestros Sitios;
* Proteger nuestros Sitios incluidas la detección y la prevención de fraudes;
* Adaptar la información que se le presenta en función de sus preferencias de navegación, como el idioma y la región geográfica;
* Monitorizar los patrones de tráfico de los usuarios dentro de nuestros Sitios y recopilar estadísticas sobre el uso que dan a la página web para ayudarnos a comprender cómo responden nuestros Sitios y cómo podemos mejorarlos para, por ejemplo, aumentar su experiencia de navegación y ofrecer servicios que sean más relevantes para usted;
* Proveernos de información comercial y de marketing;
* Rastrear a los usuarios que visitan, interactúan o utilizan cualquiera de nuestros Sitios, páginas de redes sociales, anuncios en línea y comunicaciones de marketing (como en qué anuncios hizo clic o si un usuario ha abierto o reenviado un correo electrónico que le hemos enviado);
* [Publicidad dirigida](#targetedadvertising-spanish); y
* [Seguimiento cruzado entre dispositivos y entre páginas web](#crossdevice-spanish).

**¿Quién utiliza la información almacenada en las cookies y en las tecnologías de seguimiento similares?**

Solo nosotros exclusivamente (o terceros que actúan en nuestro nombre) utilizan la información almacenada en las cookies de nuestros Sitios, con la excepción de las cookies de terceros, que las utilizan y gestionan terceros para proporcionar servicios solicitados por nosotros a fin de mejorar nuestros servicios y su experiencia al navegar por nuestros Sitios. Para obtener más información sobre las cookies propias y de terceros que Honeywell utiliza, visite nuestro [Centro de preferencias de privacidad](#).

**¿Y qué pasa con las cookies u objetos compartidos locales Flash?**

Puede que utilicemos cookies u objetos compartidos locales Flash ("LSO Flash") para almacenar sus preferencias de sitios web, personalizar su visita, evitar fraudes y otras operaciones del sitio. Si no quiere que su ordenador almacene "LSO Flash", puede ajustar la configuración de su reproductor Flash para bloquear el almacenamiento de "LSO Flash" utilizando las herramientas contenidas en el panel de configuración de almacenamiento del sitio web. También puede controlar los "LSO Flash" accediendo al panel de configuración global de almacenamiento y siguiendo las instrucciones (que pueden explicar, por ejemplo, cómo eliminar los "LSO Flash" existentes).

**Publicidad dirigida**

Rastreamos y analizamos tanto el uso individual como la información estadística colectiva relacionada con el uso que da a nuestros Sitios. También nos asociamos con terceros (como anunciantes y socios publicitarios) para mostrar publicidad en nuestros Sitios y gestionar y ofrecer publicidad en sitios de terceros. Estos terceros utilizan cookies y tecnologías de seguimiento similares para recopilar y utilizar determinada información sobre sus actividades en línea, tanto en nuestros Sitios como en sitios de terceros, a fin de medir y rastrear la efectividad de la publicidad y de nuestras actividades de marketing (por ejemplo, recogiendo información de cuántas veces hace clic en uno de nuestros anuncios). Esta información puede usarse por sí sola o en combinación con información sobre usted que obtengamos de otras fuentes (como nuestros socios de datos), sus datos de contacto y el historial de transacciones de Honeywell para deducir sus intereses y proporcionarle publicidad y marketing dirigidos que se adapten más a usted en función de sus actividades de navegación e intereses deducidos ("Publicidad personalizada"). Esta publicidad personalizada solo se proporcionará donde lo permita la ley aplicable y de acuerdo con sus preferencias de publicidad/marketing. Tenga en cuenta que las cookies y tecnologías de otros terceros están reguladas por la política de privacidad específica de cada compañía y no por este aviso de cookies.

**Seguimiento cruzado entre dispositivos y entre páginas web**

Nosotros, nuestros proveedores de servicios y otros terceros (como Google y otros socios publicitarios) podemos utilizar la información que recopilamos sobre usted (ya sea directamente de nuestros Sitios o de un tercero) con el propósito de reconocerlo en línea mediante la identificación de los Dispositivos que utiliza. Utilizamos esta información para ofrecerle [publicidad dirigida](#targetedadvertising-spanish) a través de distintos Dispositivos ("coincidencia cruzada entre dispositivos") y sitios ("seguimiento cruzado entre páginas web"). La coincidencia cruzada entre dispositivos y el seguimiento cruzado entre páginas web nos permite entender mejor la actividad de nuestros clientes, mejorar nuestra habilidad para orientar y medir campañas publicitarias (incluida la limitación del número de veces que un usuario ve un anuncio). También nos ayuda a combinar Dispositivos para que podamos facilitar sus opciones de rechazo en todos los Dispositivos que sabemos que están conectados a una cookie de rechazo.

**Desactivar las cookies y rechazar la publicidad personalizada**

Puede decidir si quiere recibir cookies utilizando nuestro [centro de preferencias de privacidad](#) o, como alternativa, la configuración de su navegador debería permitirle eliminar y/o desactivar las cookies del sitio web. Para obtener más información sobre cómo eliminar las cookies en su navegador web, consulte las instrucciones de su navegador: [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en),  [Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies), [Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4468242/microsoft-edge-browsing-data-and-privacy), [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/clear-cookies-and-site-data-firefox), [Opera](https://help.opera.com/en/latest/web-preferences/#cookies), Safari ([Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac), [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265), [iPad](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265), or [iPod touch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265)).

Si elige desactivar las cookies, puede que encuentre Sitios que no funcionen de la misma forma. Algunas cookies son necesarias para registrar y respetar las elecciones que haya hecho con respecto a no contactarle o no añadir otros tipos de cookies a sus Dispositivos. Si elimina estas cookies de su ordenador, la cookie utilizada para reconocer sus preferencias, incluida la publicidad personalizada, también se eliminará, por lo que se le pedirá que vuelva a realizar las elecciones.

Los usuarios pueden rechazar participar en redes publicitarias de terceros mediante el uso de varios sitios web de asociaciones comerciales, como:

* Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) - [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/)
* Digital Advertising alliance (DAA) – (i) Global: [https://optout.aboutads.info/](https://optout.aboutads.info/); (ii) Europa: [http://youronlinechoices.eu/](http://youronlinechoices.eu/)

Rechazar la publicidad personalizada lo excluirá de recibir contenido personalizado o publicidad de estas empresas, pero no significa que no vaya a recibir más publicidad a través de nuestro sitio web o de otros sitios web. Puede que siga viendo anuncios de Honeywell, pero ni Honeywell ni nuestros socios habrán personalizado estos anuncios para usted. Si en algún momento no quiere que su información personal se utilice para permitir que terceros le muestren anuncios o para personalizar los anuncios que aparezcan, también puede ajustar su configuración utilizando las herramientas proporcionadas por terceros, como: Google, Facebook y LinkedIn.

**Do Not Track (DNT)**

Algunos navegadores pueden transmitir señales "do-not-track" (no rastrear) a los Sitios con los que usted se comunica. Debido a las diferencias en la forma en que los navegadores de web incorporan y activan esta función, no siempre está claro si los usuarios quieren que se transmitan estas señales, o ni siquiera si las conocen. Es posible que no actuemos en respuesta a estas señales. También puede desactivar un seguimiento en particular (por ejemplo, al desactivar las cookies) y rechazar la publicidad personalizada siguiendo las instrucciones que se encuentran en la sección "[Desactivar las cookies y rechazar la publicidad personalizada](#disablingcookies-spanish)".

**Uppdaterad: 11 juni 2021**

Detta meddelande beskriver hur Honeywell International Inc. och dess dotterbolag (tillsammans ”**Honeywell**”, ”**oss**” eller ”**vi**”) använder kakor och liknande tekniker installerade på enheter som t.ex. datorer, mobila enheter eller surfplattor (”**Enheter**”) som härrör från besökare eller användare av vår webbplats, produkter och/eller applikationer (”**Webbplatser**”).

Cookies och liknande tekniker kan behandla personlig information. Gå till:

* vår [Integritetspolicy](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/privacy-statement#swedish) om du vill få mer information om hur vi behandlar dina personuppgifter och hur du utövar dina rättigheter som registrerad
* vårt [Inställningscenter för integritet](#) för mer information om de specifika cookies vi använder på våra webbplatser och för att hantera dina cookieinställningar.

**Vad är cookies?**

Cookies är små textfiler som lagras på dina enheter av webbplatser som du besöker. När du besöker våra webbplatser på nytt ansluter vår teknik automatiskt till denna cookie för att identifiera dig eller din enhet och komma ihåg information om dig, t.ex. språkinställningar eller inloggningsinformation. Vi använder också cookies från tredje part. Dessa är cookies från en domän som skiljer sig från domänen på den webbplats du besöker vilket tillåter oss, den tredje parten som äger dessa cookies och i vissa fall andra parter i cookienätverken att identifiera dig eller din enhet när du besöker olika webbplatser. När vi använder ordet ”Cookies” syftar vi på ett stycke text, pixlar, tydliga gif:ar, loggfiler, webbfyrar eller annan liknande spårningsteknik som lagras på dina enheter.

**Vi kan använda fyra olika typer av cookies:**

* **Strikt nödvändiga cookies** behövs för att våra webbplatser ska fungera och kunna tillhandahålla de tjänster och information som du har begärt. Strikt nödvändiga cookies är undantagna från kravet på samtycke.
* **Funktionella cookies** möjliggör förbättrad funktionalitet och personanpassning. Till exempel tillåter de att våra webbplatser kommer ihåg information som du tillhandahåller, t.ex. dina språkinställningar, samt lagra teknisk information som kan vara användbar för dina interaktioner med våra webbplatser. De kan ställas in av oss eller tredjepartsleverantörer vars tjänster vi har lagt till på våra webbplatser. Om du inte tillåter dessa cookies kan det hända att vissa eller alla av dessa tjänster inte fungerar korrekt.
* **Prestandacookies** samlar in information om din användning av våra webbplatser (så att vi t.ex. kan räkna besök och trafikkällor) och gör att vi kan se hur våra webbplatser presterar och därmed åstadkomma relevanta förbättringar för att göra din surfupplevelse ännu bättre (så att vi t.ex. kan få reda på vilka sidor som är mest, respektive minst, populära). All information som dessa cookies samlar in är aggregerad och följaktligen anonym.
* **Annonserings-/riktade cookies** samlar in data om din onlineaktivitet och identifierar dina intressen så att vi kan skapa en profil åt dig och därmed visa reklam som är mer relevant för just dig. Till deras funktioner hör också att t.ex förhindra att samma annonser visas om och om igen, se till att annonser visas korrekt samt välja annonser som baseras på dina intressen.

Gå till vårt [Inställningscenter för integritet](#) för mer information om de cookies som Honeywell använder.

**Varför använder vi cookies och andra liknande tekniker?**

Vi använder cookies och andra liknande spårningstekniker för följande ändamål:

* Lagra dina preferenser och inställningar;
* Tillåta dig att logga in och autentisera dig så att du kan komma åt våra webbplatser och gå från sida till sida inom våra webbplatser;
* Säkra våra webbplatser, inklusive upptäckt och förebyggande av bedrägerier;
* Skräddarsy information som presenteras för dig baserat på dina surfinställningar, t.ex. språk och geografiskt område;
* Övervaka användarnas trafikmönster på våra webbplatser och samla in statistik om din webbplatsanvändning för att hjälpa oss förstå hur våra webbplatser presterar och hur vi kan förbättra våra webbplatser för ändamål som att t.ex. förbättra din surfupplevelse och erbjuda tjänster som är mer relevanta för just dig;
* Förse oss med företags- och marknadsföringsinformation;
* Spåra användare som besöker, interagerar med eller använder någon av våra webbplatser, sidor på sociala medier, onlineannonser och marknadsföringskommunikation (t. ex. vilka annonser man klickade på eller om en användare har öppnat eller vidarebefordrat ett e-postmeddelande som vi har skickat); och
* [Riktad annonsering](#targetedadvertising-swedish); och
* [Spårning över flera enheter och flera webbplatser](#crossdevice-swedish).

**Vem använder informationen som lagras i cookies och liknande spårningstekniker?**

Informationen som lagras i våra webbplatsers kakor används uteslutande av oss (eller av tredje part som agerar för vår räkning), med undantag för cookies från tredje part som används och hanteras av externa parter i syfte att tillhandahålla tjänster som vi begärt för att kunna förbättra våra tjänster och din upplevelse när du navigerar på våra webbplatser. Gå till vårt [Inställningscenter för integritet](#) för mer information om de första- och tredjepartscookies som Honeywell använder.

**Vad gäller i fallet med Flash-cookies eller lokala delade objekt?**

Vi kan använda Flash-cookies eller lokala delade objekt (”Flash LSO”) för att lagra dina webbplatsinställningar, personanpassa ditt besök, förhindra bedrägeri och för annan webbplatsverksamhet. Om du inte vill att Flash LSO ska lagras på din dator kan du ändra inställningarna för din Flash Player för att blockera att Flash LSO lagras med hjälp av verktygen som finns i panelen Lagringsinställningar för webbplatser. Du kan även reglera hanteringen av Flash LSO genom att gå till panelen Globala sekretessinställningar och följa anvisningarna (vilka kan innehålla instruktioner som förklarar t.ex. hur man raderar befintliga Flash LSO).

**Riktad annonsering**

Vi spårar och analyserar både individualiserad användning och aggregerad statistisk information relaterad till din användning av våra webbplatser. Vi samarbetar också med tredje parter (som t.ex. annonsörer och annonspartners) för att visa reklam på våra webbplatser samt hantera och betjäna reklam på andra tredjepartswebbplatser. Dessa tredje parter använder cookies och liknande spårningstekniker för att samla in och använda viss information om dina onlineaktiviteter, antingen på våra webbplatser eller andra tredjepartswebbplatser, i syfte att mäta och spåra annonsernas effektivitet såväl som våra marknadsföringsaktiviteter online (t.ex. genom att samla in data om hur många gånger du klickar på en av våra annonser). Denna information kan användas ensam eller i kombination med information om dig som vi erhåller från andra källor (som våra datapartner), dina kontaktuppgifter och Honeywells transaktionshistorik för att driva dina intressen och tillhandahålla riktade annonser och marknadsföring som är mer skräddarsydd för just dig, baserat på dina surfaktiviteter och härledda intressen (”Intressebaserad annonsering”). Sådan intressebaserad annonsering kommer endast att tillhandahållas där det är tillåtet enligt tillämplig lag och i enlighet med dina annonserings-/marknadsföringsinställningar. Observera att andra tredjepartscookies och teknik styrs av varje företags specifika sekretesspolicy och inte detta meddelande om cookies.

**Spårning över flera enheter och flera webbplatser**

Vi, våra tjänsteleverantörer och andra tredje parter (som t.ex. Google och andra annonspartner) kan använda informationen vi samlar in om dig (vare sig direkt från våra webbplatser eller från tredje part) i syfte att känna igen dig online genom att identifiera de enheter som du använder. Vi använder den här informationen för att ge dig [riktad annonsering](#targetedadvertising-swedish) över flera olika enheter (”matchning över flera enheter”) och webbplatser (”spårning över flera platser”). Matchning över flera enheter och spårning över flera webbplatser gör det möjligt för oss att bättre förstå våra kunders aktivitet, förbättra vår förmåga att rikta in oss på och mäta annonskampanjer (inklusive att begränsa antalet gånger en användare ser en annons). Det hjälper oss också att matcha enheter så att vi kan underlätta dina val av borttagning på samtliga enheter som vi vet är anslutna till en sådan borttagningscookie.

**Inaktivera cookies och välja bort intressebaserad reklam**

Du kan välja hur du vill ta emot cookies i vårt [Inställningscenter för integritet](#), alternativt så bör dina webbläsarinställningar tillåta dig att radera och/eller inaktivera webbplatscookies. Mer information om hur du raderar cookies i din webbläsare hittar du i respektive webbläsares instruktioner: [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en), [Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies), [Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4468242/microsoft-edge-browsing-data-and-privacy), [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/clear-cookies-and-site-data-firefox), [Opera](https://help.opera.com/en/latest/web-preferences/#cookies), Safari ([Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac), [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265), [iPad eller iPod touch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265)).

Om du väljer att inaktivera cookies kan det hända att webbplatser kanske inte fungerar på samma sätt. Vissa cookies är nödvändiga för att kunna registrera och respektera de val du har gjort när det gäller att inte kontaktas eller att andra typer av cookies inte ska läggas till på din enhet. Om du tar bort cookies från din dator kommer den cookie som används för att känna igen dina inställningar, inklusive intressebaserad annonsering, att raderas och du behöver därför göra dina val på nytt.

Användare kan också välja bort tredje parters annonsnätverk genom användning av olika branschorganisationers webbplatser, som t.ex.:

* Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) - [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/)
* Digital Advertising alliance (DAA) – (i) Globalt: [https://optout.aboutads.info/](https://optout.aboutads.info/); (ii) Europa: [http://youronlinechoices.eu/](http://youronlinechoices.eu/)

Att välja bort intressebaserad annonsering kommer att välja bort dessa företags tillhandahållande av intressebaserat innehåll eller annonser till dig men betyder inte att du inte längre kommer att se någon annonsering alls på vår webbplats eller andra webbplatser. Du kan fortfarande se annonser från Honeywell, men dessa annonser kommer inte att vara anpassade för just dig av Honeywell eller någon av våra partner. Om du vid någon tidpunkt inte vill att din personliga information ska användas för att tillåta tredje parter att visa annonser eller att anpassa annonser som visas för dig kan du också justera dina inställningar med hjälp av de verktyg som tillhandahålls av tredje part, t.ex. Google, Facebook och LinkedIn.

**Spåra inte (DNT, Do Not Track)**

Vissa webbläsare kan skicka ”spåra inte”-signaler till webbplatser som du kommunicerar med. Eftersom olika webbläsare införlivar och aktiverar den här funktionen på olika sätt är det inte alltid klart om användarna verkligen avser att skicka de här signalerna eller om de ens är medvetna om dem. Det kan hända att vi inte agerar som svar på dessa signaler. Du kan också inaktivera viss spårning (t.ex. genom att inaktivera cookies) och du kan också välja bort riktad annonsering genom att följa instruktionerna i avsnittet ”[Inaktivera cookies och välja bort intressebaserad annonsering](#disablingcookies-swedish)”.

**Güncelleme: 11 Haziran 2021**  

Bu Çerez Bildirimi, Honeywell International Inc. ve bağlı kuruluşlarının (topluca "**Honeywell**", "**bize**" veya "**biz**") web sitemizi, ürünlerimizi ve/veya uygulamalarımızı ("**Siteler**") ziyaret edenlerin veya bunların kullanıcılarının bilgisayar, mobil cihaz veya tablet gibi cihazlara ("**Cihazlar**") yüklenen çerezleri ve benzer teknolojileri nasıl kullandığını açıklar.

Çerezler ve benzeri teknolojiler kişisel bilgileri işleyebilir. Lütfen şurayı ziyaret edin:

* kişisel bilgilerinizi nasıl işlediğimiz ve veri sahibi haklarınızı nasıl kullanacağınız hakkında daha fazla bilgi almak istiyorsanız [Gizlilik Bildirimi](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/privacy-statement#turkish) sayfamız
* sitelerimizde kullandığımız belirli Çerezler hakkında daha fazla bilgi ve Çerez tercihlerinizi yönetmek için [Gizlilik Tercih Merkezi](#) sayfamız.

**Çerezler nedir?**

erezler, Sitelerimizin Cihazlarınıza yerleştirdiği küçük metin dosyalarıdır. Sitelerimizi tekrar ziyaret ettiğinizde teknolojilerimiz, sizi veya Cihazınızı tanımlamak ve dil tercihiniz veya oturum açma bilgileriniz gibi sizinle ilgili bilgileri geri çağırmak için Çerez ile otomatik olarak bağlantı kurar. Bunun yanı sıra, üçüncü taraf çerezleri kullanırız. Bunlar, ziyaret ettiğiniz web sitesinin etki alanından farklı bir etki alanından bize, çerezlere sahip olan üçüncü tarafa ve bazı durumlarda, farklı web sitelerini ziyaret ederken çerez ağlarındaki diğer katılımcılara sizi veya Cihazınızı tanımlama olanağı sağlayan çerezlerdir. Cihazlarınıza yerleştirilen bir metin, piksel, net gif, günlük dosyası, web işaretçisi veya diğer benzer izleme teknolojilerini kapsamak için "Çerezler" kelimesini kullanıyoruz.

**Kullanabileceğimiz dört tür çerez vardır:**

* **Kesinlikle gerekli çerezler** Sitelerimizin çalışması ve talep ettiğiniz hizmetleri ve bilgileri size sağlaması için gereklidir. Kesinlikle gerekli çerezler, onay gerekliliğinden muaftır.
* **İşlevsel çerezler** gelişmiş işlevsellik ve kişiselleştirmeyi etkinleştirir. Örneğim, Sitelerimizin, dil tercihleriniz gibi sağladığınız bilgileri hatırlamasını ve Sitelerimizle etkileşiminiz için kullanışlı olan teknik bilgileri saklamasını sağlar. Bunlar bizim tarafımızdan veya Hizmetlerini Sitelerimize eklediğimiz üçüncü taraf sağlayıcılar tarafından belirlenebilir. Bu çerezlere izin vermezseniz, bu hizmetlerin bazıları veya tümü düzgün çalışmayabilir.
* **Performans çerezleri** Sitelerimizi kullanımınız hakkında bilgi toplar (örneğin, ziyaretleri ve trafik kaynaklarını saymamızı sağlar) ve Sitelerimizin nasıl performans gösterdiğini öğrenmemize yardımcı olur (örneğin, hangi sayfaların en çok ve en az popüler olduğunu öğrenmemizi sağlar), böylece tarama deneyiminizi iyileştirebilecek ilgili iyileştirmeler yapabiliriz. Bu çerezlerin topladığı tüm bilgiler bir araya getirilir ve bu nedenle bilgiler anonimdir.
* **Reklam/hedefleme çerezleri** sizin bir profilinizi oluşturabilmemiz ve sizinle daha alakalı reklamlar sunabilmemiz için çevrimiçi etkinliğiniz hakkında veri toplar ve ilgi alanlarınızı belirler. Aynı reklamların sürekli olarak yeniden görünmesini engelleme, reklamların düzgün görüntülenmesini sağlama ve ilgi alanlarınıza göre reklamları seçme gibi işlevleri de yerine getirirler.

Honeywell'in kullandığı Çerezler hakkında daha fazla bilgi için [Gizlilik Tercih Merkezi](#) sayfamızı ziyaret edin.

**Neden Çerezleri ve diğer benzer teknolojileri kullanıyoruz?**

Çerezleri ve diğer benzer izleme teknolojilerini aşağıdaki amaçlarla kullanıyoruz:

* Tercihlerinizi ve ayarlarınızı saklamak;
* Sitelerimize erişebilmeniz ve Sitelerimizde sayfadan sayfaya geçebilmeniz için oturum açmanızı ve kimliğinizi doğrulamanızı sağlamak;
* Dolandırıcılık tespiti ve önlenmesi dahil olmak üzere Sitelerimizi güvenli hale getirmek;
* Dil ve coğrafi bölge gibi tarama tercihlerinize göre size sunulan bilgileri uyarlamak;
* Sitelerimizin nasıl performans gösterdiğini ve tarama deneyiminizi geliştirmek ve sizinle daha alakalı hizmetler sunmak gibi amaçlarla Sitelerimizi nasıl iyileştirebileceğimizi anlamamıza yardımcı olması için Sitelerimizdeki kullanıcıların trafik modellerini izlemek ve web sitenizin kullanımıyla ilgili istatistikler toplamak;
* Tarafımıza iş ve pazarlama bilgilerini sağlamak;
* Sitelerimizi, sosyal medya sayfalarımızı, çevrimiçi reklamlarımızı ve pazarlama iletişimlerimizi ziyaret eden, bunlarla etkileşime giren veya bunları kullanan kullanıcıları takip etmek (örneğin hangi reklamların tıklandığı veya bir kullanıcının kendilerine gönderdiğimiz bir e-postayı açıp açmadığı gibi); ve
* [Hedefli Reklamcılık](#targetedadvertising-turkish); ve
* [Cihazlar arası ve siteler arası izleme](#crossdevice-turkish).

**Çerezler ve benzeri izleme teknolojilerinde saklanan bilgileri kimler kullanır?**

Sitelerimizin Çerezlerinde saklanan bilgiler, hizmetlerimizi ve Sitelerimizde gezinirken yaşadığınız deneyimi iyileştirmek amacıyla tarafımızdan talep edilen hizmetleri sağlamak için dış taraflarca kullanılan ve yönetilen üçüncü taraf Çerezler hariç, münhasıran bizim tarafımızdan (veya bizim adımıza hareket eden üçüncü taraflarca) kullanılır. Honeywell'in kullandığı birinci taraf ve üçüncü taraf çerezler hakkında daha fazla bilgi için [Gizlilik Tercih Merkezi](#) sayfamızı ziyaret edin.

**Flash Çerezleri veya Yerel Paylaşılan Nesneler nedir?**

Web sitesi tercihlerinizi saklamak, ziyaretinizi kişiselleştirmek, dolandırıcılığı önlemek ve diğer site işlemleri için Flash Çerezlerini veya Yerel Paylaşılan Nesneleri ("Flash LSO'lar") kullanabiliriz. Flash LSO'ların bilgisayarınızda depolanmasını istemiyorsanız, Web Sitesi Depolama Ayarları Panelinde bulunan araçları kullanarak Flash player'ınızın ayarlarını Flash LSO'ların depolanmasını engelleyecek şekilde ayarlayabilirsiniz. Flash LSO'ları, Genel Saklama Ayarları Paneline gidip talimatları (örneğin, mevcut Flash LSO'ların nasıl silineceğini açıklayan talimatlar bulunabilir) takip ederek de kontrol edebilirsiniz.

**Hedefli Reklamcılık**

Sitelerimizi kullanımınızla ilgili hem bireyselleştirilmiş kullanımı hem de toplu istatistiksel bilgileri izleyip analiz ediyoruz. Bununla birlikte, Sitelerimizde reklam görüntülemek ve diğer üçüncü taraf sitelerindeki reklamları yönetmek ve sunmak için üçüncü taraflarla (reklam verenler ve reklam ortakları gibi) ortaklık yapıyoruz. Bu üçüncü taraflar, reklamların ve çevrimiçi pazarlama faaliyetlerimizin etkinliğini ölçmek ve izlemek amacıyla Sitelerimizde veya diğer üçüncü taraf sitelerinde çevrimiçi etkinlikleriniz hakkında belirli bilgileri toplamak ve kullanmak için çerezleri ve benzer izleme teknolojilerini kullanır (örneğin, reklamlarımızdan birine kaç kez tıkladığınız hakkında veri toplayarak). Bu bilgiler tek başına veya sizin hakkınızda diğer kaynaklardan (veri ortaklarımız gibi), iletişim bilgilerinizden ve Honeywell işlem geçmişinizden elde ettiğimiz bilgilerle birlikte, ilgi alanlarınızı ortaya çıkarmak ve tarama etkinliklerinizi ve çıkarılan ilgi alanlarınızı ("İlgi Alanına Dayalı Reklamcılık") temel alan size daha uygun hedefli reklamlar ve pazarlama sunmak için kullanılabilir. Bu tür İlgi Alanına Dayalı Reklamlar, yalnızca geçerli yasaların izin verdiği durumlarda ve reklamcılık/pazarlama tercihlerinize uygun olarak sunulacaktır. Diğer üçüncü taraf çerezlerinin ve teknolojilerinin bu Çerez Bildirimi tarafından kapsanmadığını; her bir şirketin özel gizlilik politikasına tabi olduğunu lütfen unutmayın.

**Cihazlar arası ve siteler arası izleme**

Biz, hizmet sağlayıcılarımız ve diğer üçüncü taraflar (Google ve diğer reklam ortakları gibi), sizin hakkınızda topladığımız bilgileri (doğrudan Sitelerimizden veya bir üçüncü taraftan), kullandığınız Cihazları tanımlayarak sizi çevrimiçi olarak tanımak amacıyla kullanabiliriz. Bu bilgileri, size birden çok farklı Cihazda ("cihazlar arası eşleştirme") ve sitelerde ("siteler arası izleme") [hedefli reklamlar](#targetedadvertising-turkish) sunmak için kullanırız. Cihazlar arası eşleştirme ve siteler arası izleme müşterimizin etkinliğini daha iyi anlamamıza, reklam kampanyalarını hedefleme ve ölçme yeteneğimizi geliştirmemize (bir kullanıcının bir reklamı görme sayısını sınırlamak dahil) olanak tanır. Ayrıca, devre dışı bırakılmış bir çereze bağlı olduğunu bildiğimiz tüm Cihazlarda devre dışı bırakma seçimlerinizi kolaylaştırabilmemiz için Cihazları eşleştirmemize yardımcı olur.

**Çerezleri ve İlgi Alanına Dayalı Reklamcılığı devre dışı bırakma**

Çerez alımı konusunda [Gizlilik Tercih Merkezimizi](#) kullanarak seçim yapabilirsiniz veya alternatif olarak tarayıcı ayarlarınız web sitesi çerezlerini silmenizi ve/veya devre dışı bırakmanızı sağlar. Çerezlerinizi web tarayıcınızda nasıl sileceğiniz hakkında daha fazla bilgi için tarayıcınızın talimatlarına bakın: [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647?hl=en),  [Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17442/windows-internet-explorer-delete-manage-cookies), [Microsoft Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4468242/microsoft-edge-browsing-data-and-privacy), [Mozilla Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/clear-cookies-and-site-data-firefox), [Opera](https://help.opera.com/en/latest/web-preferences/#cookies), Safari ([Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/sfri11471/mac), [iPhone](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265), [iPad](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265), or [iPod touch](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201265)).

Çerezleri devre dışı bırakmayı seçerseniz, Sitelerin aynı şekilde çalışmadığını görebilirsiniz. Bazı çerezler, sizinle iletişime geçilmemesine veya Cihazınıza başka türden çerezlerin eklenmemesine ilişkin yaptığınız seçimleri kaydetmek ve bu seçimlere uymak için gereklidir. Çerezleri bilgisayarınızdan silerseniz, İlgi Alanına Dayalı Reklamcılık dahil tercihlerinizi tanımak için kullanılan çerez de silinir ve seçimlerinizi tekrar yapmanız gerekir.

Kullanıcılar ayrıca aşağıdakiler gibi çeşitli ticaret derneği web sitelerini kullanarak üçüncü taraf reklam ağlarını devre dışı bırakabilir:

* Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) - [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/)
* Digital Advertising alliance (DAA) – (i) Genel: [https://optout.aboutads.info/](https://optout.aboutads.info/); (ii) Avrupa: [http://youronlinechoices.eu/](http://youronlinechoices.eu/)

İlgi Alanına Dayalı Reklamcılığı devre dışı bırakmak, bu şirketlerin size ilgi alanına dayalı içerik veya reklamlar sunmasını engelleyecektir, ancak bu işlem, web sitemiz veya diğer web siteleri aracılığıyla herhangi bir reklam almayacağınız anlamına gelmez. Honeywell reklamlarını görmeye devam edebilirsiniz, ancak bu reklamlar Honeywell veya ortaklarımız tarafından size göre özelleştirilmeyecektir. Herhangi bir zamanda kişisel bilgilerinizin üçüncü tarafların reklam göstermesine veya size gösterilen reklamları kişiselleştirmesine izin vermek için kullanılmasını istemiyorsanız, üçüncü taraflar tarafından sağlanan araçları kullanarak da ayarlarınızı değiştirebilirsiniz. Google, Facebook ve LinkedIn.

**Takip Edilmeme (Do Not Track, DNT)**

Bazı web tarayıcıları, iletişimde olduğunuz sitelere “do-not-track” (takip edilmeme) sinyalleri gönderebilir. Bu işlevin kapsanması ve etkinleştirilmesi açısından web tarayıcıları arasında bulunan farklar nedeniyle kullanıcıların bu sinyalin aktarılmasını isteyip istemedikleri ve hatta bu sinyallerin farkında olup olmadıkları her zaman açık değildir. Bu sinyallere göre hareket etmeyebiliriz. Bunun yanı sıra, belirli izleme faaliyetlerini devre dışı bırakabilirsiniz (örneğin çerezleri devre dışı bırakarak) ve ayrıca "[Çerezleri ve İlgi Alanına Dayalı Reklamcılığı devre dışı bırakma](#disablingcookies-turkish)" bölümündeki talimatları izleyerek hedefli reklamcılığı da devre dışı bırakabilirsiniz.
