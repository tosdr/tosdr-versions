Collabora will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors, affiliates, and partners, as described above, Collabora discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a witness summons, court order, or other governmental request, or when Collabora believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Collabora, third parties or the public at large.

Online Demos
------------

Our online demos will allow you to try out Collabora Online. You can upload documents, share them and edit them (alone or collaboratively). But before you start to upload files, please keep the following in mind:

* Don’t upload any personal data, private or sensitive information. Sessions and data may be logged for performance and testing reasons.

* The service may disappear at any time.

---------------------------------

Our servers are located in the UK and Canada which are considered to already be bound by GDPR/DPA legislation. On these servers we host email, CRM (customer data management), Phabricator (task management system), Mattermost (internal messaging), Gitlab(source code management) and document storage.

We may occasionally use Google Docs and Hangouts to share information. This data transfer to Google servers in the United States of America is protected by Standard Contractural Clauses.

Data related to invoicing is processed by a 3rd party whose data servers are located in the United States of America. This data transfer is protected by Standard Contractual Clauses.

These 3rd parties are service providers (data processors) to Collabora and we only share information with them as part of regular business activities. In no case, does Collabora sell customer data of any kind.

7. The right to not be subject to decision based solely on automated processing.
8. The right to lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office. You can contact the Information Commissioner’s Office on 0303 123 1113 or via email \[ \] or at the Information Commissioner’s Office, Wycliffe House, Water Lane, Wilmslow, Cheshire SK9 5AF.
