Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Collabora’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Collabora will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors, affiliates, and partners, as described above, Collabora discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a witness summons, court order, or other governmental request, or when Collabora believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Collabora, third parties or the public at large.

First party cookies
-------------------

#### Anonymous analytics cookies – \[Google Analytics\] (“\_ga, \_gat”)

Google Analytics is a system used by many websites to record anonymous information about who visits a website. Google set two different cookies with expiry dates ranging from 10 minutes to 2 years. These cookies are used mainly to differentiate between first-time visitors to a website and repeat visitors. They do not contain any personally identifiable information. You can find out more about how Google use cookies at http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html. You can also review Google’s Privacy Policy on analytics here [http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html](http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html). You can opt out of Google Analytics on all sites by installing this browser plugin [http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

#### Matomo analytics cookies (“\_pk\_id, \_pk\_ses, \_pk\_ref, \_pf\_testcookie”)

Matomo is an open source web analytics platform. A web analytics platform is used by a website owner in order to measure, collect, analyse and report visitors data for purposes of understanding and optimizing their website.  

#### PHPSESSID cookie (“PHPSESSID”)

This is a session ID cookie which is stored to allow the CMS system which renders each page on this website, know which pages it has rendered during your browsing session. It stores a random number ID which has nothing to do with you or your browsing behavior.

#### Mautic cookies (“mautic\_refer\_id, mautic\_session\_id, mautic\_session\_name”)

These cookies are used to detect how visitors engaged with the website, in order to improve the information we provide on the website or through marketing campaigns. Visitors that choose not to engage with any website form or email-link will remain anonymous.

#### Controlling or deleting cookies

Depending on which web browser you use it is possible to control how cookies are used or to delete existing cookies from your computer.

Online Demos

* Don’t upload any personal data, private or sensitive information. Sessions and data may be logged for performance and testing reasons.

* The service may disappear at any time.

Transfer of data to third parties
---------------------------------

Our servers are located in the UK and Canada which are considered to already be bound by GDPR/DPA legislation. On these servers we host email, CRM (customer data management), Phabricator (task management system), Mattermost (internal messaging), Gitlab(source code management) and document storage.

We may occasionally use Google Docs and Hangouts to share information. This data transfer to Google servers in the United States of America is protected by Standard Contractural Clauses.

Data related to invoicing is processed by a 3rd party whose data servers are located in the United States of America. This data transfer is protected by Standard Contractual Clauses.

These 3rd parties are service providers (data processors) to Collabora and we only share information with them as part of regular business activities. In no case, does Collabora sell customer data of any kind.

Retention Period
----------------

* Collabora will keep all project related data for a period of 12 years from project completion.
* Personal data entered into a git repository will be retained permanently.
* Collabora will keep all financial records from the project for a period of 12 years from project completion year.

You can contact the Information Commissioner’s Office on 0303 123 1113 or via email \[ \] or at the Information Commissioner’s Office, Wycliffe House, Water Lane, Wilmslow, Cheshire SK9 5AF.
