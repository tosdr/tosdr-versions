------------------

By using this website you are consenting to our use of the cookies outlined below. We are not responsible for the use or data collected in any cookies set by third parties. Details of how to control and delete cookies are listed below.

Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer by websites that you visit. They are widely used in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to the owners of the site.

How we process personal data
----------------------------

We collect personal contact data via the contact form placed in our website when attending conferences or events. We collect data for marketing and sales purposes.

Depending on the nature of the interactions, certain users maybe asked to provide personally-identifying information. An example of this is when we ask for visitors who request a demo at collaboraoffice.com to provide personal data such as name or email address. Collabora does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

We collect personal data from User’s Feedback CSV file. Collabora’s websites have an option for the users to leave their feedback on the product. The main purpose to collect users’ feedback is to improve the product for them. Here users asked to provide personal information but they can refuse to supply personally identifying information other than just leaving their feedback.

-------------------

We collect and process the following data.

| Purpose | Data Collected |
| --- | --- |

### How do we protect Certain Personally-Identifying Information?

Collabora discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors, affiliates, and partners that;

2. that have agreed not to disclose it to others.

Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Collabora’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Collabora will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors, affiliates, and partners, as described above, Collabora discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a witness summons, court order, or other governmental request, or when Collabora believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Collabora, third parties or the public at large.

If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Collabora takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

Collabora visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers and do not wish to have their browsing profiled or to have custom content tailored to them, should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Collabora’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Collabora’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

You can also review Google’s Privacy Policy on analytics here [http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html](http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html). You can opt out of Google Analytics on all sites by installing this browser plugin [http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

#### PHPSESSID cookie (“PHPSESSID”)

We may occasionally use Google Docs and Hangouts to share information. This data transfer to Google servers in the United States of America is protected by Standard Contractural Clauses.

Data related to invoicing is processed by a 3rd party whose data servers are located in the United States of America. This data transfer is protected by Standard Contractual Clauses.

These 3rd parties are service providers (data processors) to Collabora and we only share information with them as part of regular business activities. In no case, does Collabora sell customer data of any kind.

You can contact the Information Commissioner’s Office on 0303 123 1113 or via email \[ \] or at the Information Commissioner’s Office, Wycliffe House, Water Lane, Wilmslow, Cheshire SK9 5AF.
