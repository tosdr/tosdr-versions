The information that we collect depends on the Offerings and features within those Offerings that a School uses.

We also collect some information automatically (e.g., Offerings usage information).

The School Official and/or Authorized School Personnel may provide such Personnel’s contact information such as email addresses and phone numbers. Certain Offerings require the School Official and/or their Authorized School Personnel to provide class enrollment information (e.g., class name and subject).
* _Support Requests:_ Authorized School Personnel can submit requests about the Offerings to our support center (e.g., our Support Center and our Help Center) through both our Offerings themselves and from our Website.

This information may change if a School and/or Authorized School Personnel utilize new features and/or Offerings.

### 1.2 Personal Student Information for All Offerings

When addressing a specific Offering in this Product Privacy Policy, we may refer to the name of the entity and the Personal Student Information collected by such entity. Each school in the United States must comply with any legal requirements applicable to it, which may include, providing appropriate notice and/or obtaining parental consent.

We only collect Personal Student Information where Schools have provided consent required by applicable law, including the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”).

* _School’s Request for Deletion or Transfer of Personal Student Information:_ We act upon a School’s documented instructions to delete Personal Student Information during and after all School licenses to the Offerings have expired, unless we are required to retain such information to comply with our legal obligations with law enforcement, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements. Upon instruction to delete Personal Student Information, we will take reasonable efforts to delete and/or de-identify such information in a commercially reasonable amount of time under applicable laws. At the termination of all of the School’s licenses with us, we and the School may agree to transfer the School’s Personal Student Information back to the School. In that case, similar to deletion requests, we will act upon a School’s documented instruction to transfer the School’s Personal Student Information to the School and take reasonable efforts to transfer such information in a commercially reasonable amount of time under applicable laws, unless we are required to retain such information to comply with our legal obligations, or with law enforcement, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements. For Schools in the EEA, Personal Student Information will be deleted and transferred/ported according to the terms of the DPA or other agreement between the School and us.
* _Video Conferencing Recordings: If a School enables the video conferencing feature in GoGuardian Teacher, audio and video recordings will be stored by GoGuardian for ninety (90) days. If a School enables the video conferencing feature in Pear Deck Tutor, audio and video recordings will be stored by Pear Deck Tutor for ninety (90) days after termination of its agreement with the customer._
* _Deactivated Accounts:_ We may consider a School’s account to be terminated 365 days after all of a School’s licenses expire without use, reactivation, or renewal by the School. At that time, if a School has not requested deletion of Personal Student Information, we will automatically de-identify and/or delete the School’s Personal Student Information within a commercially reasonable period of time as long as that information is not necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or enforce our agreements. All Personal Student Information retained will remain subject to our Product Privacy Policy that was in effect at that time — even after the deactivation of an account or termination of a contract.

We generally retain information other than Personal Student Information for as long as it may be relevant to the purposes above or as required or permitted by law. We consider the nature and sensitivity of the information, the purposes for which we process the information, applicable legal requirements, and our legitimate interests in determining how long to retain information.  The purposes for which we use information may dictate different retention periods for the same types of information.  To dispose of any personal information, we may anonymize it, delete it or take other appropriate de-identifying steps. Please note that information may persist in copies made for backup and business continuity purposes for an additional period of time.

6\. Your Rights and Choices About Information Collected Through Our Offerings
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

You have certain rights and choices with respect to your information as further described in this section.

Your choices about School Profile Information and School Log and Cookie Information:

* _Promotional Communications:_ You can decline promotional communications at the point information is requested for such purpose (e.g., by checking the relevant box) or, by following the unsubscribe instructions on communications sent to you. You can also contact us as described in the “How to Contact Us” section below.
* _Cookies and Analytics._ You can opt out from certain cookie-related and analytics processing by following the instructions in our Cookie Notice below.

Privacy rights related to School Profile Information and School Log and Cookie Information: 

Residents of certain jurisdictions have rights with respect to personal information, but, except as set forth below, these rights do not apply to business to business information (e.g., business contact, contract and business communications).  In addition, these rights do not apply to personal information collected by Liminex when Liminex is acting as a service provider of a School (though we assist Schools in fulfilling requests that they receive). You can read more about any such applicable rights at our [Privacy Policy for Website visitors](https://www.peardeck.com/policies/privacy-policy-for-website-visitors). If you are acting on behalf of your School and would like to submit a data request, please follow the instructions described in the Section titled “School’s Request for Deletion or Transfer of Personal Student Information.” Similarly, if you are a parent, guardian, eligible student, or Authorized Personnel and would like to submit a data request to us, please follow the instructions described in the Section titled “Requests from Parents, Legal Guardians, Eligible Students, and Authorized School Personnel.”

With respect to School Profile Information and School Log and Cookie Information, residents of the EEA, UK, and California may request that we:

* (1) provide access to and/or a copy of such information; (2) prevent the processing of that individual’s information for direct-marketing purposes (including any direct marketing processing based on profiling); (3) update an individual’s information which is out of date or incorrect; (4) delete certain information that we are holding about an individual; and (5) restrict the way that we process and disclose certain of the individual’s information. We will consider all requests and provide our response within the time period stated by applicable law. Please note, however, that certain information may be exempt from such requests in some circumstances, which may include if we need to continue processing an individual’s information for our legitimate interests or to comply with a legal obligation. We may request that an individual and/or School provide us with information necessary to confirm the individual’s identity before responding to your request. To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at privacy@goguardian.com. Authorized agents for California residents may submit requests at: [https://www.goguardian.com/ccpa-requests](https://www.goguardian.com/ccpa-requests?__hstc=4451244.0d456da7e863253ebfb2300d52614dad.1673026256264.1699567208945.1699570364598.35&__hssc=4451244.8.1699570364598&__hsfp=3599258620).   In addition to those rights, you may have the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant supervisory authority. However, we encourage the individual to contact us first, and we will do our very best to resolve the individual’s concern.
* In addition, California residents may annually request a list of the third parties to which a company discloses “personal information” for such third parties’ marketing purposes and the types of information disclosed. However, we do not disclose personal information to third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes.

Your choices about School Information (Except School Profile Information), Personal Student Information, and Parent/Guardian Information:

* _Cooperation with Schools._ We will assist the School in facilitating requests relating to Authorized School Personnel Information and Personal Student Information pursuant to the School’s instruction as explained further in the “How Long We Keep Information" or in the “Your Rights and Choices About Information Collected Through Our Offerings” sections above.
* _Requests from Parents, Legal Guardians, Eligible Students, and Authorized School Personnel:_

_Review, Correction, and Deletion Requests.  
  
_If a parent, legal guardian, eligible student, or Authorized School Personnel wishes to request a review, correction, deletion of Personal Student Information or School Information, he/she should contact the appropriate School Official of his/her or his/her child’s School. We will cooperate with the School to fulfill requests pursuant to the School’s verification and instruction within a commercially reasonable amount of time and in compliance with relevant law.Parent App: If you are a user of the Parent App, you can review information about the choices you may have with respect to the personal information you provide through the Parent App in the “Your Rights and Choices” section of our [Privacy Policy for Website Visitors](https://www.peardeck.com/policies/privacy-policy-for-website-visitors).If you are Authorized School Personnel, please note that we may be required to maintain certain School Information if directed to do so by your School Official on behalf of your School employer or as needed by us to enforce our legal rights._Transfer Requests._ Our Offerings allow Authorized School Personnel to download information on behalf of a parent, legal guardian, eligible student, or School Personnel. If our Offerings do not cover the scope of the transfer request, we will, following documented instructions from the School, honor the requests from the parent, legal guardian, eligible student, or Authorized School Personnel for the transfer of Personal Student Information or personal data of the Authorized School Personnel by utilizing the same guidelines as described above in “Review, Correction, and Deletion Requests” in compliance with and as required by relevant law._Transfer Requests for Student-Generated Content._ California law requires website operators to transfer student-generated content to the student’s personal account when requested by an eligible student, parent, or guardian. The Offerings are not used as the primary platform for students to submit their own content. To the extent that students in California, or in other states with similar transfer laws, submit their content on the Offerings, the appropriate parent, guardian, or eligible student may submit a request to privacy@goguardian.com to transfer this information to him/her. Following verification of the requestor’s authorization to receive the information (which may require verification by the requestor’s School), we will provide the student-generated content that we have in a commercially reasonable amount of time in either a CSV or other mutually-agreeable format. Please note that we cannot guarantee retention of student-generated content.

7\. How We Protect Your Information
-----------------------------------

We take the security and privacy of your School’s data very seriously. For these reasons, we have implemented various technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to protect your information, including specific training of our personnel authorized to access Personal Student Information and other information. These safeguards vary depending on the sensitivity of the information at issue.

We are committed to preventing unauthorized access to our systems and data, and will investigate any possible occurrence. In the event of a breach of Personal Student Information, we will comply with all relevant breach laws to assist the School or provide notification as required to you, a School, affected parents, legal guardians, eligible students, and regulators.

### 7.1 Additional Information for California Residents

If you are a California resident, California law requires us to provide you with some additional information.  We collect the following categories of personal information: identifiers (such as name and email address); internet or other network information (how users interact with our Products); and other information that identifies or can be reasonably associated with you (such as your correspondence with us). We also collect information at the direction of Schools including education information, location information (about devices), and audio and visual information.  

We use such information to 

* set up and provide our Offerings;
* analyze and improve our Offerings;
* respond to a School’s and/or Authorized School Personnel’s requests and to provide related support;
* administer and troubleshoot our Offerings;
* send information to a School and Authorized School Personnel about how to use our Offerings and other important updates;
* notify a School and Authorized School Officials about new features or Offerings that may be of interest to them, and, similarly notify other Authorized School Personnel of new features or Products that may be of interest to them when residents of the United States or otherwise as permitted by law;
* help prevent fraud and to enforce the legal terms that govern our Offerings;
* to comply with applicable law and protect our and others’ rights, safety and property; 
* follow further instructions of a School

We retain such information as long as it is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which we collect it, unless a longer retention is required or permitted by law. We consider the nature and sensitivity of the information, the purposes for which we process the information, applicable legal requirements, and our legitimate interests in determining how long to retain information.

8\. Notice to E.E.A. and Other Non-U.S. Residents
-------------------------------------------------

European Union (“EU”) data protection laws make a distinction between organizations that process personal data for their own purposes (known as "data controllers") and organizations that process personal data on behalf of other organizations (known as "data processors"). Depending on the particular circumstance, we and your School may act either as a data controller or a data processor of your personal data. The laws in some jurisdictions like the EU also require data controllers to share the legal ground that they rely upon to use or disclose personal information.

### 8.1 Liminex as a Data Controller vs. Data Processor

Liminex is considered the “processor” of School Information (except for School Profile Information), Personal Student Information and Parent/Guardian Information. We collect, use, share and disclose this information as a processor on behalf of and at the instruction of the School controller, pursuant to [our EULA](https://www.peardeck.com/policies/product-terms-and-end-user-license-agreement) and, if applicable, [DPA](https://www.peardeck.com/policies/data-processing-addendum). If you have a question or complaint about how your personal data is handled, please contact your School.

We are considered the “controller” of School Profile Information and School Log and Cookie Information. We as the data controller collects, uses, shares, and discloses this information as described above in this Product Privacy Policy. We retain the personal data contained in this information for as long as necessary to provide you with Offerings, or for other important purposes such as complying with legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements.

Our legal grounds for using School Profile Information and School Log and Cookie Information are as follows:

* _Contractual Commitments:_ We use, share, and disclose information to honor our contractual commitments to a School.
* _Legal Compliance:_ We need to use, share, and disclose information in certain ways to comply with our legal obligations.
* _With Your Consent:_ Where required by law, and in some other cases, we use, share, or disclose information on the basis of consent.
* _Legitimate Interests:_ In many cases, we use, share, or disclose information on the ground that it furthers our legitimate business interests in ways that are not overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the affected individuals, such as customer service, analyzing and improving our business, promotional activities, providing security for our Offerings, preventing fraud, and managing legal issues.

### 8.2 Information Transfer To The United States

The Offerings are operated in the United States. If you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that any information that you provide to us will be transferred to and/or accessed within the United States. The recipients of information described in the relevant “How We Disclose Information Collected Through Our Offerings” sections above may be located in the United States. This information may be subject to United States law, including laws that may require disclosure of personal information to government authorities. Schools may export Personal Data to jurisdictions outside the European Economic Area on the basis of legal mechanisms approved by the European Commission and other relevant authorities for cross-border data transfers, such as Standard Contractual Clauses.

* _European Union-United States and Swiss-United States Data Privacy Frameworks:_ We have certified to the European Union-United States and Swiss-United States Data Privacy Framework (collectively, the “Framework”) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of “personal data” (as defined under the Framework principles) from applicable European Economic Area (“EEA”) countries and Switzerland, respectively. We have certified that we adhere to the Framework Principles with respect to personal data transferred under the Framework. To learn more about the Framework and view our certification, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Framework list by clicking [here](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/). We may also protect personal data through other legally valid methods, including international and data transfer agreements.
* As required under the Framework principles, when we receive personal data under the Framework and then transfer it to a third-party service provider acting as an agent on our behalf, we have certain liability under the Framework if both (i) the agent processes the information in a manner inconsistent with the Framework; and (ii) we are responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
* _Choices of International Users: Some international users (including those whose information we collect under the Framework) of Offerings have certain legal rights to access certain information that we hold about them and to request its deletion. Please see the “_Your Rights and Choices About Information Collected Through Our Offerings_” section above for more information._

### 8.3 How to Contact Us and Dispute Resolution

_How to Contact Us for Non-U.S. Residents:_ Individuals located outside the United States who have questions or concerns regarding our Product Privacy Policy or practices may direct a complaint in writing to Chief Privacy Officer, Liminex, Inc., 2030 East Maple Avenue, Suite 100, El Segundo, California 90245. Tel: 888-310-0410 Email: privacy@goguardian.com. Within a reasonable time of receiving the written complaint, we will review and address the complaint, as appropriate, and inform the individual of the results of such review and any steps taken to address the complaint.

_Dispute Resolution for EEA and Swiss Residents: If you are a resident of the EU or Switzerland whose personal data is subject to the Framework, and you are dissatisfied with the manner in which we have addressed your concerns or we fail to respond to you within 45 days of your complaint, you may seek further assistance, at no cost to you, from our designated Data Privacy Framework independent recourse mechanism, the JAMS Data Privacy Framework Program, which you can learn more about by visiting_ [_https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-data-privacy-framework_](https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-data-privacy-framework)_. Residents of the EU or Switzerland whose personal data is subject to the Framework may, in certain circumstances, elect to arbitrate unresolved complaints by invoking binding arbitration pursuant to the Framework’s Recourse, Enforcement and Liability Principle and Annex I of the Framework (see:_ [_https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/article/How-to-Submit-a-Complaint-Relating-to-a-Participating-Organization-s-Compliance-with-the-DPF-Principles-dpf_](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/article/How-to-Submit-a-Complaint-Relating-to-a-Participating-Organization-s-Compliance-with-the-DPF-Principles-dpf)_) but prior to initiating such arbitration, you must: (1) afford us the opportunity to resolve the issue; (2) seek assistance via our recourse mechanism above; and (3) contact the U.S. Department of Commerce (either directly or through the relevant Data Protection Authority) and afford the U.S. Department of Commerce time to attempt to resolve the issue. Each party shall be responsible for its own attorney’s fees. Please be advised that, pursuant to the Framework, the arbitrator(s) may only impose individual-specific, non-monetary, equitable relief necessary to remedy any violation of the Framework Principles with respect to the individual. We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC)._

_For Australian residents: If you are located in Australia, and are dissatisfied with the way we have handled a privacy issue, you may contact the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner for more information_ [_www.oaic.gov.au_](https://www.oaic.gov.au/)_._

_For Singapore residents: If you are located in Singapore, and are dissatisfied with the way we have handled a privacy issue, you may contact the Personal Data Protection Commission for more information_ [_www.pdpc.gov.sg_](https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/)_._
