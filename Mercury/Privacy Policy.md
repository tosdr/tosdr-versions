Mercury Privacy Policy

Last Modified: January 8, 2024

Mercury Technologies, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively "Mercury," "we," "our," or "us") are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your personal data (“Personal Data”) is collected, used and disclosed by Mercury. This Privacy Policy applies to all our Services. By accessing or using our Services, or by otherwise demonstrating your consent to this Privacy Policy, you signify that you have read, understood and agree to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use. If you are an Administrator, you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of Company with the authority to bind Company to this Privacy Policy, and that you agree to this Privacy Policy on Company’s and on each User’s behalf.

Terms not defined in this Privacy Policy will have the meaning set forth in our [Terms of Use](https://mercury.com/legal/terms).

1\. What Information Do We Collect and for What Purpose?

In Table 1 below, we provide the list of categories of Personal Data that Mercury collects and has collected within the last twelve months and some examples for a better understanding. We have also identified the main sources and purposes for collection in Table 1.

Please note that additional information may be requested and collected throughout the life of the account relationship to meet regulatory and legal requirements or depending on whether you enable optional features or functionalities of the Services. We may collect any communications between you and Mercury, including any photos, text, videos and any other information you upload or provide to us. We may, but have no obligation to, monitor, record, and store any Personal Data you provide to us in order to protect your safety or the safety of other users, to assist with regulatory or law enforcement efforts, or to protect and defend our rights and property. Optional features may require we collect certain additional data as may be further notified to you in connection with such features. For example, if your organization enables Mercury’s integration with Google Workspace, we will collect email addresses of members of your Google Workspace from Google in order to invite such users to set up a Mercury account; if they set up an account with us, we will store those email addresses to enable their Mercury account. By using the Services or enabling optional features, you consent to the recording, storage and disclosure of such communications you send or receive for the purposes outlined herein or as otherwise notified to you.

3\. How We Use Cookies and Other Tracking Technology to Collect Information.

We, and our third-party partners, automatically collect certain types of usage information when you visit our Services, read our emails, or otherwise engage with us. We typically collect this information through a variety of tracking technologies, including cookies, Flash objects, web beacons, file information and similar technology (collectively, "Tracking Technologies"). "Cookies" are small packets of data that a website stores on your computer’s or mobile device’s hard drive (or other storage medium) so that your computer will "remember" information about your use. We use both first and third party session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies make it easier for you to navigate our Services and expire when you close the Services. Persistent cookies remain on your device for an extended period of time or until you delete them. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our visitors to personalize the experience on our Services.

Through the Tracking Technologies we collect information about your device and its software, such as your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, platform type, device type, operating system, date and time stamp, a unique ID that allows us to uniquely identify your browser, mobile device or your Account, and other such information. We also collect information about the way you use our Services, for example, the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave our website, the pages you visit, the links you click, how frequently you access the Services, whether you open emails or click the links contained in emails, whether you access the Services from multiple devices, and other actions you take on the Services. When you access our Services from a mobile device, we may collect unique identification numbers associated with your device or our mobile application (including, for example, a UDID, Unique ID for Advertisers ("IDFA"), Google AdID, or Windows Advertising ID), mobile carrier, device type, model and manufacturer, mobile device operating system brand and model, phone number, and depending on your mobile device settings, your geographical location data, including GPS coordinates (e.g., latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device, or we may be able to approximate a device’s location by analyzing other information, like an IP address.

We may use one or more third–party analytics services to evaluate your use of the Services, as the case may be, by compiling reports on activity (based on their collection of IP addresses, Internet service provider, browser type, operating system and language, referring and exit pages and URLs, data and time, amount of time spent on particular pages, what sections of the Website you visit, number of links clicked, search terms and other similar usage data) and analyzing performance metrics. These third parties use cookies and other technologies to help collect, analyze, and provide us reports or other data.

By accessing and using the Services, you consent to the processing of data about you by these analytics providers in the manner and for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. Please be advised that if you opt out of this Privacy Policy, you may not be able to use the full functionality of the Services. We use the third-party analytics providers listed below; this list is subject to change:

* For Google Analytics, please visit: [https://www.google.com/analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics)
* For Hubspot, please visit: [https://legal.hubspot.com/privacy-policy](https://legal.hubspot.com/privacy-policy)
* For Segment, please visit: [https://segment.com/legal/privacy/](https://segment.com/legal/privacy/)
* For Amplitude, please visit: [https://amplitude.com/privacy](https://amplitude.com/privacy)

The following link explains how Google uses data when you use its partners’ websites and applications: [www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/). Your use of the Services is evidence of your consent to Mercury storing and accessing cookies and other information on your computer or phone and Mercury’s use of Google Analytics in connection with such activities. Please read the information at the link provided so you understand what you are consenting to.

Although we do our best to honor the privacy preferences of our Users, we are unable to respond to Do Not Track signals set by your browser at this time.

We use or may use the data collected through Tracking Technologies to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information, including targeted content and advertising; (c) identify you across multiple devices; (d) provide and monitor the effectiveness of our Service; (e) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, usage, and demographic patterns on our Services; (f) diagnose or fix technology problems; and (g) otherwise to plan for and enhance our Services.

If you would prefer not to accept cookies, most browsers will allow you to: (i) change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; (ii) disable existing cookies; or (iii) set your browser to automatically reject cookies. Please note that doing so may negatively impact your experience using the Services, as some features and services on our Services may not work properly. Depending on your mobile device and operating system, you may not be able to delete or block all cookies. You may also set your e-mail options to prevent the automatic downloading of images that may contain technologies that would allow us to know whether you have accessed our e-mail and performed certain functions with it. Note that deleting cookies does not delete Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as Flash objects and HTML5. You can learn more about Flash objects - including how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies – on Adobe’s website. If you choose to delete Flash objects from our sites, then you may not be able to access and use all or part of the Services or benefit from the information and services offered.

We and our third-party partners may also use cookies and tracking technologies for advertising purposes. For more information about use of Tracking Technologies by our third-party partners, please see "Third Party Tracking and Online Advertising" below.

6\. Third Party Tracking and Online Advertising

We may share, or we may permit third party online advertising networks, social media companies and other third-party services, to collect, information about your use of our Services over time so that they may play or display ads that may be relevant to your interests on our Services as well as on other websites or apps, or on other devices you may use. Typically, though not always, the information we share is provided through cookies or similar tracking technologies, which recognize the device you are using and collect information, including hashed data, click stream information, browser type, time and date you visited the Services, and other information. This information is used to display targeted ads on or through our Services or on other websites or apps, including on Facebook. We or the online advertising networks use this information to make the advertisements you see online more relevant to your interests. As noted above, depending on your browser or mobile device, you may be able set your browser to delete or notify you of cookies and other tracking technology by actively managing the settings on your browser or mobile device. You may also be able to limit interest-based advertising through the settings on your mobile device by selecting "limit ad tracking" (iOS) or "opt-out of interest based ads" (Android). To learn more about interest-based advertising and how you may be able to opt-out of some of this advertising, you may wish to visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s online resources, at [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices), and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance’s resources at [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices), and you may also adjust your ad preferences through your Facebook settings. You may also be able to opt-out of some – but not all – interest-based ads served by mobile ad networks by visiting [http://youradchoices.com/appchoices](http://youradchoices.com/appchoices) and downloading the mobile AppChoices app. If you have any questions about opting out of the collection of cookies and other tracking/recording tools, you can contact us directly at [\[email protected\]](https://mercury.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

Facebook Custom Audience Ads. We may work with Facebook to display interest-based ads to you or to your friends on Facebook through a tool offered by Facebook called the Custom Audience Tool. This tool allows us to personalize our ads based on you or your friends’ experience on our Services in order to provide ads tailored for each specific recipient. We do not share Personal Data about your activities on our Services with Facebook, but we share a hashed email address or phone number which permits Facebook to identify our advertising audience based on the information that Facebook collects from its users. If you do not want to receive interest-based ads on Facebook, you can adjust your ad preferences through your Facebook settings. If you do not want us to use your content to personalize advertising that we direct to your friends on Facebook, you may email us at [\[email protected\]](https://mercury.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

7\. How We Store and Protect Your Information

Data Storage and Transfer: Personal Data collected through our Services may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Mercury or its affiliates or service providers maintain facilities. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer Personal Data, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction, and you acknowledge such transfer of information to the U.S. or any other country in which the Mercury or its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, or service providers maintain facilities and the use and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.

Keeping your Information Safe: We care about the security of your Personal Data and use commercially reasonable physical, administrative, and technological safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of all Personal Data collected through our Services. However, no security system is impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee the security of our systems or the systems of the third parties with which we may share your Personal Data, nor can we guarantee that the Personal Data you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted over the Internet. In particular, e-mail sent to us may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what Personal Data you send to us via e-mail.
