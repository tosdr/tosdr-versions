4\. Cookies And Other Tracking Technologies.

We, and our third-party partners, use cookies to automatically collect certain types of usage information when you visit our website, use our Services, read our emails, or otherwise engage with us. We typically collect this information through a variety of tracking technologies, including cookies, Flash objects, web beacons, file information and similar technology (collectively, "Tracking Technologies").

What are cookies? "Cookies" are small packets of data that a website stores on your computer’s or mobile device’s hard drive (or other storage medium) so that your computer will "remember" information about your use. Below is a summary of the types of cookies we use.

* Essential Cookies: These are cookies without which you would not be able to use our Services. For example, essential cookies adjust the website data transmitted to match your internet connection, get you to the secure versions of the website, and help provide products or services you specifically request. If you set your browser to block these cookies, some parts of our website will not work.
* Analytic Cookies: These cookies count visits and traffic sources to measure and improve the effectiveness of our Services. We may use persistent cookies, which will remain on your computer even after you close your browser, to understand general website usage and volume statistical information (which does not include personal information) and improve the content and offerings on our websites. We may also use persistent cookies to store user preferences.
* Functional cookies: These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make and provide enhanced functionality and more personalized features. These technologies are used so that we can provide a continuous and more personalized experience for you (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to a website).
* Advertising Cookies: These cookies help us manage and display our advertisements based on your activity on our Websites and other websites; this is known as interest-based advertising. We may use targeting cookies to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may allow third-party ad servers (i.e., third parties that provide technology to place ads on websites and track ad performance) to use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to automatically collect information about your visit to our websites or to place our ads on third-party websites and to analyze the effectiveness of those ads. We use or may use the data collected through Tracking Technologies to provide custom, personalized content, information, and product offers, including targeted content and advertising.

Interest-based advertising. We and our third-party partners may also use cookies and tracking technologies for advertising purposes. We may share, or we may permit third party online advertising networks and other third-party services, to collect, information about your use of our Services over time so that they may play or display ads that may be relevant to your interests on our Services as well as on other websites or apps, or on other devices you may use.

We may use one or more third–party analytics services (like Google Analytics) to evaluate your use of our Services, as the case may be, by compiling reports on activity (based on their collection of IP addresses, Internet service provider, browser type, operating system and language, referring and exit pages and URLs, data and time, amount of time spent on particular pages, what sections of the website you visit, number of links clicked, search terms and other similar usage data) and analyzing performance metrics. For more information about Google Analytics, please review the site “How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services,” located at [www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites). To opt out of Google Analytics specifically, please go to [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). Please note that by blocking any or all cookies, you may not be able to use the full functionality of our Services.

Depending on your browser or mobile device, you may be able set your browser to delete or notify you of cookies and other tracking technology by actively managing the settings on your browser or mobile device. You may also be able to limit interest-based advertising through the settings on your mobile device by selecting "limit ad tracking" (iOS) or "opt-out of interest based ads" (Android). To learn more about interest-based advertising and how you may be able to opt-out of some of this advertising, you may wish to visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s online resources, at [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices), and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance’s resources at [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices), and you may also adjust your ad preferences through your social media settings, where applicable. You may also be able to opt-out of some – but not all – interest-based ads served by mobile ad networks by visiting [http://youradchoices.com/appchoices](http://youradchoices.com/appchoices) and downloading the mobile AppChoices app. If you have any questions about opting out of the collection of cookies and other tracking/recording tools, you can contact us directly at [\[email protected\]](https://mercury.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

6\. How We Protect Your Information

Data storage and transfer: Personal Data collected through our Services may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Mercury or its affiliates subsidiaries, Business Partners, or Service Providers maintain facilities. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that with respect to “personal data” that you may provide to us, we serve as the “controller” and may transfer Personal Data to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction. Where possible, we take steps to treat Personal Data using the same privacy principles that apply pursuant to the law of the country in which we first received your information, and in all cases, we shall put in place adequate safeguards to ensure your personal data has an equivalent level of protection. By using our services, you acknowledge and agree to such transfer of information to the U.S. or any other country in which Mercury or its affiliates, subsidiaries, Business Partners, or Service Providers maintain facilities and the use and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.

Keeping your information safe: We care about the security of your Personal Data and while we use reasonable efforts to protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure, cannot guarantee the security of your Personal Data.

If we are required by law to inform you of a breach to your Personal Data, we may notify you electronically, in writing, or by telephone, if permitted to do so by law.

Links to other websites and services. Our Services may contain links to the third-party websites of our Business Partners, advertisers, and social media sites. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for their policies. We strongly recommend that you read their privacy policies and terms and conditions of use to understand how they collect, use, and share Personal Data. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content on the websites of third-party sites.

Deidentified information. To the extent we process “deidentified” Personal Data, as defined under applicable law, we will maintain and use that information in deidentified form and will not attempt to reidentify the information except as permitted by applicable law.

To protect your information, we will verify your identity before responding to your request. To verify your identity, we will request some information from you, like your email address and phone number, and/or by requiring you to log into your Account. We may also ask to see your government ID, along with a current digital photo of your face so we can ensure the photo ID truly belongs to you.

Authorized agents. In some circumstances, you may designate an authorized agent to submit requests to exercise certain privacy rights on your behalf. If any authorized agent submits a request on your behalf, we require the authorized agent to submit the following information so that we can confirm their authority to act on your behalf:

* Evidence of your identity: (1) first and last name, (2) email address, and (3) password.

If we do not receive both pieces of information, the request will be denied.
