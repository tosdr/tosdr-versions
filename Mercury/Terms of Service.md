Mercury Terms of Use

Last Modified: July 2024

Mercury Technologies, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively "Mercury," "we," or "us") welcome you. This page explains the terms by which you may use our website located at [https://mercury.com](https://mercury.com/) (the "Site"), our mobile application (the "App,"), and the services we provide or facilitate access to via our Site and App (collectively, the Site,App, and services are referenced as "Services").

By creating an account that will facilitate your use of the Services (an "Account,"), or by otherwise manifesting your assent to these Terms of Use, you signify that you have read, understood and agree to be bound by these terms of Use and the Service Schedule(s) for any Service(s) that you have purchased from Mercury (collectively, the "Agreement,").By applying for any Service provided by our banking service provider(s), you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the applicable agreements of the banking service provider(s) for your Account. These may include demand deposit accounts ("Deposit Account,"), savings accounts ("Savings Account,"), and/or charge and debit cards ("Cards,") provided by one of our financial institution providers ("Banking Provider,"), depending on what Services you use through Mercury (collectively, ("Provider Accounts,").

Mercury reserves the right to make modifications to these terms and will provide notice of these changes by posting an updated version to our [legal page](https://mercury.com/legal/terms). "You" means the legal entity or individual that is applying for or that has opened an Account to use the Services. You may use the Services only if you can form a binding agreement with Mercury. If you are opening the Account on behalf of a company, you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the company with the authority to bind the company to this Agreement ("Administrator,") and that that company can form a binding contract with Mercury. PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND EACH PROVISION. THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER PROVISION THAT REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS.

1\. Use of the Services

1. Eligibility. This is a contract between you and Mercury. You must read and agree to these terms before using the Services. If you do not agree, you may not use the Services. You may only apply for an Account, and use the applicable Services under such Account, if you are a United States citizen and are at least 18 years of age (for personal accounts) or a legal entity formed and registered in the United States or in another jurisdiction authorized by Mercury and/or its Banking Providers. You may only use the Services in compliance with this Agreement and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules, and regulations. Except with respect to access to our Site and personal accounts, any use of or access to the Services for consumer or non-commercial purposes by anyone who is not your employee, contractor, agent, or other individual permitted to use your Account on your behalf ("User") is strictly prohibited and in violation of this Agreement.
2. Creating an Account. Your Account may give you access to certain Services, including Services provided through the Provider Accounts, and any other functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion. You will need to provide certain company information and/or personal information (collectively, "Customer Information"), when you create an Account. Customer Information may include individual consumer information (for personal accounts), or your registered business name and state of incorporation, the business address, ownership details, the nature of the business, and other business information we may request from time to time; the name, contact information, and date of birth of Administrators, Users or beneficial owners, and other personal information; and a corporate registration certificate, proof of address, personal identification, and any other documentary information used to verify business and personal information. We provide Customer Information to our Banking Providers and other third-party service providers to determine your eligibility for access to certain Services. We rely on the accuracy of the Customer Information you provide us when opening and maintaining your Account. We may deny your applications, suspend provision of such Services to you, or close your Account if Company Information is out of date, incomplete, or inaccurate. By creating an Account, you represent that you are a legal owner of, and that you are authorized to provide us with, all Customer Information and other information necessary to facilitate your use of the Services.
3. Account Management and Security. You must specify at least one Administrator to manage your Account when submitting your application. Administrators can add, remove, or manage additional Administrators and Users; request and manage Cards for Users; view transactions and run reports; provide or update Customer Information; connect third-party services, and other accounts to your Account; and perform other tasks to manage your Account. You are responsible for any actions or failure to act on the part of Administrators or Users, or those using their credentials to access your Account. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your Account, and you must keep your Account secure. We encourage you to use "strong" passwords (for recommendations on what constitutes a strong password, check the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)) with your Account. MFA is required; we encourage you to use strong second factors such as security keys([https://mercury.com/help/adding-security-keys](https://mercury.com/help/adding-security-keys)). You must notify Mercury immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your Account. Mercury will not be liable for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your Account. We may suspend access to your Account if we believe that your Account has been compromised.
4. Prohibitions. You agree that you will not: (a) use the Account or the Services for any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited by this Agreement; (b) use the Account or the Services for any personal, family, household, or other non-commercial purposes (with the exception for personal account(s); (c) use the Account or the Services for the benefit, either directly or indirectly, of an individual, organization, or country identified on the United States Office of Foreign Asset Control’s Specially Designated Nationals List or any other U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties, (d) use the Account or the Services for any third parties (e) use the Account or the Services to collect any market research for a competing business, (f) impersonate any person or entity or falsely state or otherwise misrepresent your affiliation with a person or entity, (g) interfere with or attempt to interrupt the proper operation of the Services through the use of any virus, device, information collection or transmission mechanism, software or routine, or access or attempt to gain access to any Mercury IP, data, files, or passwords related to the Services through hacking, password or data mining, or any other means; (h) decompile, reverse engineer, or disassemble any software or other products or processes accessible through the Services; (i) circumvent, remove, alter, deactivate, degrade, or thwart any of the Content protections in the Services; (j) use any robot, spider, scraper, or other automated means to access the Services for any purpose without our express, written permission; provided, however, we grant the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the public portions of the Services for the sole purpose of, and solely to the extent necessary for, creating publicly-available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials; (k) take any action that imposes or may impose (in our sole discretion) an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our technical infrastructure; (l) use the Account or the Services for any inappropriate, improper, discriminatory, illegal, or otherwise harmful purpose or to violate, or encourage the violation of, the rights of others, each as reasonably determined by Mercury; and (m) use the Account or the Services to engage in abusive, harassing, threatening, offensive, or otherwise improper conduct towards Mercury or its employees, agents, service providers, partners, or other customers.
5. Beta Services. Mercury may make certain Services, features, or functionalities available to you, which we may designate as a beta, pilot, limited release, evaluation, or by a similar description, to be used in conjunction with or separate from the Services (“Beta Services”). You may accept or decline any such Beta Services at your sole discretion. You acknowledge that Beta Services may be unstable, feature-incomplete, contain bugs, and subject to erroneous output and operation. Mercury may describe limitations that exist within a Beta Service; however, your reliance on the accuracy or completeness of these descriptions is at your own risk. You should not use Beta Services for any critical or important functions without taking appropriate precautions to prevent loss or damage resulting from such use.

You may terminate this Agreement by paying all amounts you owe and providing notice to us; except that you will still be responsible for any charges, fees, fines, and other losses caused by your action or inaction prior to terminating this Agreement.

By accessing the Services after we make any such changes to this Agreement, you are deemed to have accepted such changes. Please refer back to this Agreement on a regular basis.

10\. Governing Law, Arbitration, and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver

1. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. This Agreement constitutes a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16). You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in San Francisco County, California for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. Subject to Section 10B, you agree that the federal or state courts located in San Francisco County, California is the proper forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings in the event that the Arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable.
2. Arbitration. READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM MERCURY. For any claim, dispute, or controversy with Mercury (a "Claim"), you agree to first contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://mercury.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that Mercury has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after sixty (60) days, such dispute will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration governed by the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA"). Any election to arbitrate, at any time, shall be final and binding on the other party. NEITHER PARTY SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIM IN COURT OR TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL, EXCEPT EITHER PARTY MAY BRING ITS CLAIM IN ITS LOCAL SMALL CLAIMS COURT, IF PERMITTED BY THAT SMALL CLAIMS COURT RULES AND IF WITHIN SUCH COURT’S JURISDICTION. ARBITRATION IS DIFFERENT FROM COURT, AND DISCOVERY AND APPEAL RIGHTS MAY ALSO BE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION. All disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator selected jointly by the parties, whose decision will be final, except for a limited right of appeal under the FAA. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted by JAMS pursuant to its then current Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those rules, or, where appropriate, pursuant to JAMS’ Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures. All applicable JAMS’ rules and procedures are available at the JAMS website [www.jamsadr.com](http://www.jamsadr.com/). Each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules. Judgment on the arbitrator’s award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This clause shall not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. If conducted in person, the arbitration shall take place in the United States county where you reside. The parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay a proceeding pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator. The parties shall cooperate in good faith in the voluntary and informal exchange of all non-privileged documents and other information (including electronically stored information) relevant to the Claim immediately after commencement of the arbitration. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our data security, Intellectual Property Rights or other proprietary rights. Proceedings and information related to them will be maintained as confidential, including the nature and details of the Claim, evidence produced, testimony given, and the outcome of the Claim, unless such information was already in the public domain or was independently obtained. You and Mercury, and all witnesses, advisors, and arbitrators will only share such information as necessary to prepare for or conduct arbitration or other legal proceeding, or enforcement of the outcome, unless additional disclosure is required by law.
3. Class Action Waiver. You agree that any arbitration or proceeding shall be limited to the Claims between us and you individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (i) no arbitration or proceeding shall be joined with any other; (ii) there is no right or authority for any Claim to be arbitrated or resolved on a class action-basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (iii) there is no right or authority for any Claim to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons. YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST US ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.

11\. Downloading the App

We make the App available through the Google Play Store or Apple App Store. The following terms apply to the App when accessed through or downloaded from the Apple App Store where the App may now or in the future be made available. You acknowledge and agree that:

* Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims you have or any claims of any third party relating to the App or your possession and use of the App, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the App fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.
* In the event of any third party claim that the App or your possession and use of that App infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, Mercury will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement, and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim to the extent required by this Agreement.
* Apple and its affiliates are third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement as related to your license to the Aps, and that, upon your acceptance of this Agreement, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement as related to your license of the App against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof.
* You represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a terrorist-supporting country; (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties; (iii) you are not an individual, or associated with an entity, designated under the UK’s Terrorist Asset-Freezing etc. Act 2010 (TAFA 2010); and (iv) you are not otherwise subject to or affected in any way by any national security or terrorism related rules whether applicable to you personally or to your location or other circumstances.
* You must also comply with all applicable third-party terms of service when using the App.

12\. General

2. Notification Procedures and Changes to the Agreement. You consent to us providing notices to you under this Agreement electronically. We may provide notices to you electronically through your Account, or via email, text, or SMS to the email address or phone numbers provided to us by Administrators and Users.

Administrators and Users will be responsible for all costs imposed by internet or mobile service providers for sending or receiving notices electronically.

3. Entire Agreement/Severability. This Agreement, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Mercury in connection with the Services, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Mercury concerning your Account and the Services. If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect, except that in the event of unenforceability of the universal Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver, the entire arbitration agreement shall be unenforceable.
4. No Waiver. No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Mercury’s failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
5. Legal Orders. We may respond to and comply with any subpoenas, warrants, liens, or any other legal order we receive related to your use of the Services. We are not responsible to you for any losses you incur due to our response to such legal order. We may hold funds or provide information as required by the issuer of the legal order or take any other actions we believe are required of us under legal orders. Where permitted, we will provide you reasonable notice that we have received such an order.

7. Electronic Documents and Signatures. Mercury facilitates the completion and/or execution of electronic documents between parties. Nothing in the Agreement may be construed to make Mercury a party to or liable for any electronic documents processed through the Services. Users consent to the use of electronic signatures and understand that this consent has the same legal effect as a physical signature. Mercury is not responsible for determining how long documents and other records are required to be retained or stored and is not responsible for or liable to produce any of Customer’s electronic documents or other documents to any third parties.
