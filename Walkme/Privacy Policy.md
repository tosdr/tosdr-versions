WalkMe and its affiliates,  (“**WalkMe**“, “**we**” or “**us**“) are committed to protecting the privacy of the users of its website at [www.WalkMe.com](https://www.walkme.com/) or any other website owned and/or operated by WalkMe (collectively, the “**Site**“) and its online products, including our web-based digital adoption platform (the “**WalkMe System™**) and the mobile version of our system (the “**WalkMe Mobile™**“) (WalkMe System™ and WalkMe Mobile™ each a “**Service**” and collectively the “**Services**“) provided to our enterprise customers (“**Customers**”).

This Privacy Policy explains the types of information we collect from you or that you may provide when you:

* visit our Site, make enquiries, request a demo of our Services or otherwise contact us (“**Site Users**”);
* set up and operate an account on behalf of a Customer using our Services (“**Authorized Representative(s)**”); and
* use our Services as an end user of a Customer (e.g. an employee of a Customer or client/user of a Customer’s platform or mobile application where the Service is deployed) (“**End User(s)**”).

Depending on your role as noted above, this Privacy Policy will apply to you differently and sets out our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information, as well as your rights in determining what we do with the information that we collect and hold about you.

To the extent the General Data Protection Regulation or the UK GDPR (together referred to as the “**GDPR**”) applies to our own processing activities, WalkMe Ltd., WalkMe UK Limited or WalkMe, Inc. are the controller of such data (“**Controller**”) (unless otherwise stated).

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully so that you understand your rights in relation to your personal information, and how we will collect, use and process your personal information. This Privacy Policy supplements any other privacy related notices and policies we may provide to you from time to time, and is not intended to override them. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy in general or any part of it, you should not use our Services or otherwise provide your information to us.
