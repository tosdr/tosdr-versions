Depending on your role as noted above, this Privacy Policy will apply to you differently and sets out our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information, as well as your rights in determining what we do with the information that we collect and hold about you.

This Privacy Policy supplements any other privacy related notices and policies we may provide to you from time to time, and is not intended to override them. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy in general or any part of it, you should not use our Services or otherwise provide your information to us.

WalkMe complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce.
