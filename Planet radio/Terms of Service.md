However, network providers may charge varying amounts for these types of call, so the total cost of your call may vary to those promoted by us. We encourage you to check with your network provider;

d)     invalid or unsuccessful entries made via these methods may still be charged. Entries that are submitted before lines open or after lines close will not be entered in the Competition, but you may still be charged for your call or text

4.2            **On-Air Competitions**:

a)       In relation to On-air Competitions where callers are brought on-air (or are recorded off-air for later broadcast), time constraints may mean that we may proceed to the next caller if any caller does not answer our call promptly or if the telephone line drops out or breaks up during our call. We will have no liability to any caller who does not answer our call promptly for whatever reason, or for the awarding of any prize to a caller whose line dropped out or broke up for whatever reason. In addition, if a contestant or winner cannot be contacted by us to participate or enter any on-air Competition (including where a third party answers the telephone on the contestant or winner’s behalf) we reserve the right to disqualify that person and to select a replacement contestant or winner (whichever is applicable).

b)     The entry periods specified in the Specific Terms appliable to each Competition are final and are not impacted by the time of broadcast of announcements advertising how to enter the Competition, which may in some circumstance be delayed.

c)        We may also record (and store) audio recordings of entrants off-air which may be broadcast on-air at a later time at our sole discretion. Any such recording will only take place after the entry period to a Competition has closed and never when phone lines (or any other entry routes) are still open.

You simply need to visit one of our participating websites and enter by following the on-screen instructions.

There is a limit of one (1) entry per household per day, per URL on which the Online Giveaway in displayed. You will often be asked to complete a question before entering your email address - this helps us to ensure that entries received are from true competition lovers and not from computer generated programmes otherwise known as 'robots.' We reserve the right to offer multiple giveaways simultaneously on our various websites.

In the case of multiple entries received in a single envelope or postcard, only one entry will be entered into the promotion. Entries sent by post must be received at the relevant postal address specified for entries by the closing date and time for receipt of entries.

4.8            **Deficient entries:** In all Competitions, we reserve the right to reject any entries that are incomplete, incomprehensible, damaged or otherwise deficient. We also reserve the right to reject entries that are unlawful, indecent, racist, inflammatory, defamatory or which we consider to be otherwise harmful. We accept no responsibility for any late, lost or misdirected entries including but not limited to texts, calls or emails not received due to technical disruptions, network congestion, loss in service of online entry mechanisms, computer error in transit or any other reason. Proof of posting of any postal entry will not be proof of our receipt of that entry. We cannot enter into correspondence with entrants who experience difficulties with entering online.

4.9             **Automated Entry**: The use of any automated entry software or any other mechanical or electronic means that permits any person to enter any Competition repeatedly is prohibited.

4.10          **Names:** Entrants must enter Competitions using their legal name once only. We reserve the right to disqualify any entrant who uses multiple names and to require them to return any prize they may have won.

4.11          **Multiple Entries.** Unless otherwise permitted pursuant to the applicable Specific Terms or unless it is an Online Giveaway Competition, no person may enter any Competition more than once and persons may not enter or participate as part of a syndicate or on behalf of any other person, syndicate, group, society or company.

4.12          **Prize Limits.** Unless otherwise stated in the Specific Terms, each entrant is limited to winning one prize per Competition. There is no limit on the value of a single prize that may be provided to the individual winners of a Competition. However, so that we can ensure fairness of our Competitions we reserve the right to prevent a person to win more than one prize valued at £500 or more via any of our Competitions in any given six (6) month period. For avoidance of doubt this means that an entrant will not be eligible to win any prize if the entrant has in the past six (6) months won a prize valued at £500 or more.  We reserve the right to disqualify your mobile phone number from future Competitions during this period.

4.13          **Bonus entries.** We may from time to time award bonus entries for entering our competitions at our sole discretion.

Any entrant deemed to be rude or offensive to our staff or other entrants on social media, telephone, electronic communications, post or in person will be disqualified from entry and may ultimately be banned from future entry to promotions

4.15          **Retrospective Effect.** Where an entrant or prize winner has been found to be in breach of any of the terms and conditions of a Competition and in particular where a person is in breach of the entry restrictions set out in paragraphs 4.4 to 4.12 above, we may still enforce our right to disqualify that person and require the return or reimbursement to us of any prize even where a prize has been awarded and/or actually provided to the entrant or prize winner in question.

**4       PRIZES**

5.1             We reserve the right (when reasonably required to do so) to replace the stated prizes with prizes that we consider to be of broadly equivalent value. We offer no cash alternative for non-cash prizes and prize winners must accept prizes in the form offered. Where a prize is won by a person younger than 18, we reserve the right to award the prize to the prize winner's parent or guardian on behalf of the prize winner.

5.2             All prize winners will be notified that they have won a prize within twenty-eight (28) days of the closing date of the Competition or such shorter time period as specified in any Specific Terms via at least one of the following methods:

(a)    by telephone;

(b)    by email;

(c)     in writing; or

(d)    on-air at the time of winning (in the case of on-air Competitions);

5.3             If we are unable to contact a winner to award a prize either within 28 days of them winning, or such shorter time period as specified in any Specific Terms, then the winner forfeits entirely their right to the prize and we reserve the right  to disqualify that entrant (without further liability to that entrant) and to award the prize to an alternative winner where possible.

5.4             Prizes will be despatched to the winners via the UK mail service, unless otherwise stated. We will not be liable for any prizes which are lost, delayed or damaged in the post for reasons beyond our reasonable control. Further details will be set out in the Specific Terms and/or given to winners when they are notified that they’ve won.

5.4             Prizes will only be delivered to an address within the UK. Should a prize winner's contact details change, it is their responsibility to notify us, or the contact person(s) detailed in the Competition’s Specific Terms.                 

5.5             We reserve the right to request proof of a prize winner's identity in the form of a passport or driver’s licence and proof of address in the form of a utility bill. In the event that a prize winner cannot provide us with proof of identity and/or address that is reasonably acceptable to us, we may withdraw the prize and select another prize winner.

5.6             All prizes are subject to availability, non-transferable and non-exchangeable. Where prizes consist of entry tickets, attendance at events, holidays and similar time-specific benefits, they must be taken on the dates specified by us (or any relevant third-party provider). Prize winners will forfeit any element of their prize that they do not take at the time stipulated in the Specific Terms. No cash will be awarded in lieu of that prize or any part of it.

5.7             Any tax or other charges payable as a result of a prize being awarded or received will be the responsibility of the winner. Winners should seek independent financial advice prior to accepting a prize if this is a concern.

5.8             We make no representation or warranty in relation to prizes provided and to the fullest extent permitted by law we shall have no liability to you in relation to any prize, its fitness for purpose, merchantability or otherwise. We reserve the right to disqualify entrants from entering our Competitions or prize winners from receiving their prizes where any such person engages in unsafe, illegal, unsociable or inappropriate behaviour.

5.9             All stated prize values are at the supplier's recommended retail price in pounds sterling and are, to the best of our knowledge and belief, correct at the time of printing. We take no responsibility for any fluctuations in prize values. We award cash prizes in the form of a cheque in the name of the prize winner.  Any other arrangement will be at our discretion.

5.10          No additional, further or other costs or expenses are included in any prize unless stated. For example, the costs of transport to and from a venue for an event are not included and any accommodation prize includes basic room charge only.

5.11          Third party suppliers of prizes may also often stipulate their own terms, conditions or restrictions and all prize winners agree to be bound by these. Subject to paragraph 19.2, Bauer shall have no liability in relation to any prize provided by a third-party provider.

6.               **HOLIDAY PRIZES**

6.1             Due to their complexity, these additional terms apply to holiday prize winners and (if the holiday is for the prize winner ‘plus guest(s)’) any travelling companion that accompanies the prize winner on the holiday as their “**Guest**”.

7.2             If a Competition that you participate in or a prize that you win involves travel, stunts or physical challenges you should notify us of any medical condition that you (and, if applicable, your Guests) have and at our absolute discretion we may require you (and your Guests) as a condition of entering the Competition or receiving the prize to:
