We are then able to compare the cookie ID we have for you with IDs that our advertisers hold to see if we both know who you are. By knowing it’s you (or your device), the advertiser can decide if they want to advertise to you and if so, what advertising would be relevant

Bauer Media will use different types of cookies at various different pages of your use of our websites, these types of cookies include:

### **1.  Functionality Cookies**

These are essential to the running of a Bauer Media website.

Session cookies are not stored on your computer and the information these cookies collect is anonymised and they cannot track your browsing activity on other website.

We also enable some advertising partners to set cookies specifically to enable them to analyse advertising campaign performance.

**Third Party Cookies**
-----------------------

Please click onto this link to see more information about how these tools[\[VS1\]](#_msocom_1)  use cookies.

### a) **Third party cookies for advertising**.

Many of our websites carry advertising. A certain amount of this advertising is tailored to the individual user, as practice known as **"Online Behavioral Advertising"** which uses cookies to discover general information about the pages you visit. This keeps many of our websites and services you use free of charge. The tracking system is anonymised and therefore it does not know who you are; it simply uses the limited information available to it to serve adverts to you, which it believes are relevant. It does not collect personal information such as your name, email address postal address or telephone number.

From time to time, Bauer Media may share this anonymised behavioural data with our advertising partners. This could mean that when you are on other websites you are served advertising based on your behaviour across Bauer Media titles or you may be served advertising based on your behaviour on other sites.

Behavioural retargeting is another form of Online Behavioural Advertising that enables us and some of our advertising partners to show you adverts based on browsing patterns and interactions with the site away from our sites. For example, if you have visited the website of Car Dealership you may start seeing adverts from that same Dealership site displaying special offers or showing you the products that you were browsing. This is allows companies to advertise to website visitors who leave their website without making a purchase.

If you want to opt out of receiving Online Behavioural Advertising this does not mean that you will no longer receive advertising when you are using our sites. It just means that the advertising you see will not be customised for you. If you would like more information about Onsite behavioural targeting and how to opt out of it, please visit [www.youronlinechoices.com](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/) or you can also visit [http://www.networkadvertising.org/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/)

Our websites uses JavaScript to detect the use of ad blocking extensions for web browsers, we do not store any information on users’ devices and process no personal data.

### b) **Third party cookies for tracking/user analysis**.

Many of our websites also use cookies to track how many individual unique users we have and how often they visit Bauer Media's websites. We use 3rd party companies for this service such as Google Analytics provided by Google.

### c) **Other third party cookies**.

Some pages on our websites, other companies may also set their own anonymous cookies. They do this to track the success of their application, or to customise the application for you. We cannot access these cookies, nor can the other company access the data in cookies we use on our websites.

**Bauer Media Marketing Cookies**
---------------------------------

These are normally supplied by our approved partners or adverts delivered from Bauer Media's own systems and allow us to serve you adverts that you might be more interested in. This tracking system will log what adverts you see and will cap the number of times you see an advertisement. The data collected is anonymised and therefore the cookies do not know who you are.
