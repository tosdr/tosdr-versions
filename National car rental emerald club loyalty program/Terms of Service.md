The foregoing limitation of liability is not applicable to residents of New Jersey.  With respect to residents of New Jersey, National, its related companies, and each such company’s directors, officers, employees and agents are not liable for any damages unless such damages are the result of our negligent or reckless acts or omissions; and We are not, in any case, liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain damages, so the above may not apply to you. If any authority holds any portion of this section to be unenforceable, then liability will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

### INDEMNITY

You agree to indemnify and hold National and its related companies and each of their respective directors, officers, employees and agents harmless from and against any third-party claim or cause of action, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, arising, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, out of your violation of any law or the rights of any person.

### DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISION - MANDATORY ARBITRATION AGREEMENT

**YOU AND NATIONAL EACH WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ACTION PURSUANT TO THE FOLLOWING TERMS. YOU AND NATIONAL AGREE TO ARBITRATE ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, CONTROVERSIES OR DISPUTES OF ANY KIND ("CLAIMS") AGAINST EACH OTHER ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THESE TERMS OF USE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, CLAIMS RELATING TO NATIONAL'S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, CHARGES, ADVERTISINGS, RENTAL VEHICLES, VEHICLE RESERVATIONS, OR THIS SITE. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISION, "YOU" ALSO INCLUDES ANY OF YOUR AGENTS, BENEFICIARIES, ASSIGNS, OR ANYONE ACTING ON BEHALF OF THE FOREGOING, AND "NATIONAL" ALSO INCLUDES ANY OF ITS EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, AFFILIATES, PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, BENEFICIARIES, ASSIGNS, AND VENDORS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ITS SERVICE PROVIDERS AND MARKETING PARTNERS. YOU AND NATIONAL AGREE THAT NO CLAIMS WILL BE PURSUED OR RESOLVED AS A PART OF A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING, THAT NO ARBITRATION FORUM WILL HAVE JURISDICTION TO DECIDE ANY CLAIMS ON A CLASS-WIDE, COLLECTIVE, OR CONSOLIDATED BASIS, AND THAT NO RULES OR OTHER PROCEDURES FOR CLASS-WIDE OR COLLECTIVE ARBITRATION WILL APPLY. This Dispute Resolution Provision is to be broadly interpreted and applies to all Claims based in contract, tort, statute, or any other legal theory, and all Claims that arose prior to or after termination of these Terms of Use. However, the parties agree that either party may bring an individual action in a small claims court with valid jurisdiction, provided that the action remains in that court (other than any appeal of the small claims court ruling), is made on behalf of or against you only and is not made part of a class action, private attorney general action or other representative or collective action. The parties also agree that claims against or by a third-party insurance company ostensibly providing coverage to you or any AAD or the application of National's financial responsibility relating to the use or operation of an National rental vehicle may be brought in a court with valid jurisdiction.**

### PROCEDURE

A party must send a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice") describing (a) the nature and basis of the Claim; and (b) the relief sought, to the other party. The Notice to National should be addressed to: CT Corporation, 208 S LaSalle, Suite 814, Chicago, IL 60604 ("Notice Address"). If you and National do not resolve the Claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, a party may commence an arbitration by filing a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") pursuant to its Consumer Arbitration Rules. Claims will be resolved pursuant to the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules in effect at the time of the demand, as modified by these Terms of Use. However, a single arbitrator will be selected according to AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitrator will conduct hearings, if any, by teleconference or videoconference, rather than by personal appearances, unless the arbitrator determines upon request by you or National that an in-person hearing is appropriate. Any in-person appearances will be held at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, such determination should be made by the AAA or by the arbitrator. The AAA rules are available online at [www.adr.org](https://www.adr.org/). Except as required by law, neither a party nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any dispute or arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of both parties.

### ARBITRATOR'S AUTHORITY

The arbitrator is bound by these Terms of Use, this Dispute Resolution Provision, the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA") and AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules. The arbitrator has no authority to join or consolidate Claims, or adjudicate joined and consolidated Claims. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the scope, interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms of Use, including whether they are void. The parties agree that the arbitrator's decision and award will be final and binding and may be confirmed or challenged in any court with jurisdiction only as permitted under the FAA. The arbitrator can award the same damages and relief as a court, but only in favor of an individual party and for a party's individual claim.

### ARBITRATION COSTS

You will be responsible for your share of any arbitration fees (e.g., filing, administrative, etc.), but only up to the amount of filing fees you would incur if the Claims were filed in court. National will be responsible for all additional arbitration fees. You are responsible for all other costs/fees that you incur in arbitration, e.g., fees for attorneys, expert witnesses, etc. You will not be required to reimburse National for any fees unless the arbitrator finds that the substance of your Claim(s) or the relief sought is frivolous. If the arbitrator makes such a finding, AAA Rules will govern the payment of all fees, and National may seek reasonable attorney's fees. National will pay all fees and costs it is required by law to pay.

### GOVERNING LAW AND ENFORCEMENT

Notwithstanding anything in these Terms of Use, this Dispute Resolution Provision is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the FAA, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16. This Dispute Resolution Provision was drafted in compliance with the laws in all states. However, if any portion of it is deemed to be invalid or unenforceable or is found not to apply to a Claim, the remainder of the Dispute Resolution Provision remains in full force and effect.

### APPLICABLE LAW

These Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Missouri, United States of America, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Any action to enforce these Terms of Use regarding a claim not subject to binding arbitration must be brought in the federal court in the Eastern District of Missouri or the state courts located in St. Louis County, Missouri. By using the Site, you consent to the jurisdiction and venue of these courts. Any claim or cause of action you may have with respect to the Site must be commenced within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arises, regardless of any law to the contrary. This limitation does not apply to residents of New Jersey.

### GENERAL

If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision must be construed consistent with applicable law, and the remaining provisions must be enforced. Headings are for reference purposes only and in no way define, limit, construe or describe the scope of such section. Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of that or any other provision. These Terms of Use set forth the entire agreement between you and National in connection with your use of the Site or Mobile App.
