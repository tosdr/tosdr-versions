9. **DISCLAIMER**.

**9.1 Disclaimer.** TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE SUPPLYFRAME OFFERINGS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS,” AND SUPPLYFRAME MAKES NO (AND HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL) WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS, OR CONDITIONS, WHETHER WRITTEN, ORAL, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, WITH RESPECT TO THE USE, MISUSE, OR INABILITY TO USE THE SUPPLYFRAME OFFERINGS (IN WHOLE OR IN PART) OR ANY OTHER PRODUCTS OR SERVICES PROVIDED TO YOU BY SUPPLYFRAME. SUPPLYFRAME DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ALL ERRORS CAN BE CORRECTED, OR THAT OPERATION OF THE SUPPLYFRAME OFFERINGS SHALL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE.

**9.2 Internet Delays.** THE SUPPLYFRAME OFFERINGS MAY BE SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS, DELAYS, AND OTHER PROBLEMS INHERENT IN THE USE OF THE INTERNET AND ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS. SUPPLYFRAME IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DELAYS, DELIVERY FAILURES OR OTHER DAMAGES RESULTING FROM SUCH PROBLEMS.

10. **LIMITATION OF LIABILITY**.

**10.1 Types of Damages.** TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL SUPPLYFRAME, OR ITS SUPPLIERS, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR ANY LOST PROFITS, INCLUDING ANY SUCH DAMAGES OR COSTS DUE TO LOSS OF DATA, USE OR GOODWILL, PERSONAL OR PROPERTY DAMAGE RESULTING FROM OR IN CONNECTION WITH SUPPLYFRAME’S PERFORMANCE HEREUNDER OR THE USE, MISUSE, OR INABILITY TO USE THE SUPPLYFRAME OFFERINGS OR OTHER PRODUCTS OR SERVICES HEREUNDER, REGARDLESS OF THE CAUSE OF ACTION OR THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN TORT, CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF SUPPLYFRAME HAS BEEN NOTIFIED OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT SHALL SUPPLYFRAME BE LIABLE FOR PROCUREMENT COSTS OF SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES.

**10.2 Amount of Damages.** THE MAXIMUM LIABILITY OF SUPPLYFRAME ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED TO THE SUPPLYFRAME OFFERINGS OR THESE TERMS SHALL NOT EXCEED FIFTY DOLLARS ($50). THE EXISTENCE OF ONE OR MORE CLAIMS UNDER THESE TERMS WILL NOT INCREASE SUPPLYFRAME’S LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT SHALL SUPPLYFRAME’S SUPPLIERS HAVE ANY LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED TO THESE TERMS.

**10.3 Basis of the Bargain.** The parties agree that the limitations of liability set forth in this section shall survive and continue in full force and effect despite any failure of consideration or of an exclusive remedy. The parties acknowledge that the SUPPLYFRAME would not be willing to provide the SUPPLYFRAME Offerings without these limitations of liability and that all such limitations form an essential basis of the bargain between the parties.

**10.4 Additional Rights.** Certain states and/or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental, consequential or certain other types of damages, so the exclusions set forth above may not apply to you.

11. **INDEMNIFICATION**. You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless SupplyFrame (and its suppliers) from and against any claims, suits, losses, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) brought by third parties resulting from or relating to: (i) your use of the SupplyFrame Offerings, (ii) your User Content, or (iii) your violation of these Terms. SupplyFrame reserves the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify SupplyFrame and you agree to cooperate with our defense of these claims. You agree not to settle any matter without the prior written consent of SupplyFrame. SupplyFrame will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such claim, action or proceeding upon becoming aware of it.
12. **TERM; TERMINIATION**. These Terms will continue to apply until terminated by either you or SupplyFrame as set forth below (the "**Term**"). We may terminate these Terms at any time for any reason or no reason by sending you an e-mail to the address of record in your account. In addition, these Terms will automatically terminate upon any breach of these Terms by you. You may terminate these Terms with respect to a particular SupplyFrame Offering at any time by (a) notifying SupplyFrame at any time; and (b) closing your account for such SupplyFrame Offering. Upon any termination of these Terms with respect to a particular SupplyFrame Offering, you shall promptly discontinue use of such SupplyFrame Offering and your account and right to access and use such SupplyFrame Offering will terminate immediately, including access to your User Content. However, the sections titled _IP Ownership, User Content, Release, Disclaimer, Limitation of Liability, Indemnification, Term; Termination and Miscellaneous of these Terms_ will survive any termination of the Terms. You agree that we will have no liability to you for any costs, expenses, losses, damages, or liabilities relating to such termination.
13. **MISCELLANEOUS**.

**13.1 Dispute Resolution.**

PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.

Except for either party’s claims of infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret, any and all disputes between you and SupplyFrame arising under or related in any way to these Terms, must be resolved through binding arbitration as described in this section. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be interpreted broadly. It includes, but is not limited to, all claims and disputes relating to the Sites, Service Content, User Content or Services.

YOU AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND SUPPLYFRAME ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. YOU AND SUPPLYFRAME AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. ANY ARBITRATION WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED.

The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by this section. For any claim where the total amount of the award sought is $10,000 or less, the AAA, you and SupplyFrame must abide by the following rules: (a) the arbitration shall be conducted solely based on written submissions; and (b) the arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties. If the claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA rules, and the hearing (if any) must take place in your choice of the following locations: San Francisco, CA, Denver, CO, or New York, NY . The arbitrator’s ruling is binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. In the event this agreement to arbitrate is held unenforceable by a court, then the disputes that would otherwise have been arbitrated shall be exclusively brought in the state or federal courts located in San Francisco County, California. Claims of infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret shall be exclusively brought in the state and federal courts located in San Francisco County, California.

**13.2 Notices.** You are responsible for updating your data to provide SupplyFrame with your most current email address.

**13.3 General.** The parties are independent contractors. You may not assign these Terms, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of SupplyFrame. SupplyFrame may freely assign these Terms, in whole or in part. If any provision of these Terms is unenforceable, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect. All waivers by SupplyFrame will be effective only if in writing. Any waiver or failure by SupplyFrame to enforce any provision of these Terms on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion. You acknowledge that the SupplyFrame Offerings contain valuable trade secrets and proprietary information of SupplyFrame, that any actual or threatened breach of Section 4 (License Grant and Restrictions) of these Terms will constitute immediate, irreparable harm to SupplyFrame for which monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy, and that injunctive relief is an appropriate remedy for such breach.
