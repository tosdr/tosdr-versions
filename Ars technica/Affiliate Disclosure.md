Affiliate Link Policy
=====================

Some articles on Ars Technica contain links to products available from online retailers. These links may contain codes that signal to the retailer that Ars Technica has referred you. Should you choose to purchase the product, Ars Technica may receive a commission on the sale. This is called an affiliate program.

We apply the same rigor and standards of objectivity to these articles as we do to the rest of Ars Technica’s journalism. Ars Technica writers and editors are instructed not to select stories or alter coverage because of this program, and they are not incentivized to do so. In most cases, posts with affiliate links will also include an individual disclaimer located near the link or "buy" button for that product.
