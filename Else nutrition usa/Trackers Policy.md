==============

Else’s Website - Cookie Policy

Last Revised: July 25, 2021

Else Nutrition Holdings Inc. (“Else”, “we”, “our” or “us”) welcomes you (the “User(s)”, or “you”) to our Site. We are committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. We aim to be as open and transparent as possible around the information we collect when you visit and use our Site, including through the use of “Cookies” and other similar tracking technologies (as defined below).

1. Introduction

This cookie policy (“Cookie Policy”) explains what Cookies (as defined below) are and how we use them. It also explains the different types of Cookies we use, and how you can change or delete them. We hope that this policy will assist you in understanding, and feeling more confident about, our use of Cookies.

For information on how your information is collected and used by us in general, please see our [Privacy Policy](https://www.express.co.uk/privacy) at [https://elsenutrition.com/policies/privacy-policy](https://elsenutrition.com/policies/privacy-policy) (“Privacy Policy”).

2. What are cookies?

Cookies are small text files which are stored on, and accessed from, your computer or mobile device when you visit or use the Site. We use cookies, web beacons, pixels, clear gifs and other similar tools (collectively, “Cookies”) on our Site to recognize your device from those of other Users of the Site, to improve the services and the Site, to deliver a better and more personalized service according to the User’s individual interests and the device or browser used, to track Users’ use of the Site, to gather information about the Users’ approximate geographic location (_e.g._ city), to provide localized content, to prevent fraud and/or abuse, to estimate our audience size and usage pattern and perform other analytics, to develop our services and to administer targeted advertising and our advertising campaigns to Users across different websites and devices.

3. How long will Cookies stay on my device?

Most of the Cookies we use are erased from your device immediately after your browser session terminates (“Session Cookies”). Other Cookies remain saved on your device and enable us to recognize your device in the event of a later visit to our Site (“Persistent Cookies”). Persistent Cookies allow us to make our Site more user-friendly, effective and safe and to record your acceptance of our cookie policy detailed herein. Please note that the data collected through Cookies will not be kept for longer than is necessary to fulfil the purposes mentioned above.

4. First and third party Cookies

First-party Cookies are Cookies that belong to us and that we place on your device. Third-party Cookies are Cookies that another party, which provides us a service, places on your device through your use of our Site. For example, to administer our Site and for research purposes, we have contracted third-party service providers to track and analyze statistical usage and volume information from our Users and in order to advertise our products and services to you elsewhere on the Internet.

5. Do we track whether users open our emails?

Our emails may contain a single “web beacon pixel” which enables us to verify whether our emails (and any links or advertisements within the email) are opened. We may use this information to determine whether our emails are of interest to Users, to approach Users who do not open our emails and verify whether they wish to continue receiving them and to inform our advertisers in aggregate of the audience size for their advertisements. Please note that such “web beacon pixel” will be deleted once you delete the email from your email account. If you do not wish the “web beacon pixel” to be downloaded to your device at all, please set your email account settings to receive emails from us in plain text rather than HTML.

6. What sort of Cookies do our Site use?

Generally, our Cookies perform the following functions:

* Essential Cookies – those Cookies are essential to navigate around the Site and use its features. For example, they allow us to remember your Cookie preferences and to verify if something is not working properly, so we can fix it quickly.
* Analytical and Performance Cookies – those Cookies are used to analyze how our Users use our Site and to monitor the Site’s ’s performance. For example, we might use performance Cookies to keep track of which pages are frequently visited and from what locations our Users come from. We might also use these Cookies to highlight Site services that we think will be of interest to you based on your usage of the Site. We generally use third party Cookies to perform these services, for example, Google Analytics.
* Functionality Cookies – those Cookies allow us to operate the Site in accordance with your preferences when browsing or using the Site. For example, such Cookies recall your customization preferences, such as your preferred text size, fonts, languages and other parts of the Site that are alterable. 
* Targeting Cookies – those Cookies collect information about your activities on our Site, thus enabling us to advertise our products and services, directly to you, on third party platforms (such as Facebook), including across browsers and devices. For more information on the development of user-profiles and the use of targeting/advertising Cookies, please see [//www.aboutads.info/choices/](https://www.aboutads.info/choices/).

Below are certain specific Cookies you can find on our Site:

| Name | Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Google Analytics | Third party Tracking Technology | Performance cookie. |
| Facebook Cookies | Third party Social Networking Cookies | Targeting and Tracking Cookies. |

However, if you block or erase Cookies, your experience of the Site may be limited.
