PRIVACY POLICY FOR KRISP
------------------------

_Last updated: May 7, 2024_

Welcome to [www.krisp.ai](https://www.krisp.ai/) (“**Site**”), hosted by Krisp Technologies, Inc. (“**Company**”, “**we**”, “**us**” and/or “**our**”). Company provides AI meeting assistant and noise cancellation technologies to individuals and businesses (“**Krisp**”). In order to provide the Site and/or Krisp, we collect personal data from our Site visitors (“**Site Visitors**”) and our customers (“**Customers**”). We also collect the personal data of our Customers’ Authorized Users (as defined in the [Krisp Terms of Use](https://krisp.ai/terms-of-use/)) when they use Krisp, and we also collect certain information from third parties. All references to “you” and “your” in this Privacy Policy mean the Site Visitors, Customers, including the person accepting this Privacy Policy on behalf of an entity or organization, and Authorized Users, as the case may be.

This Privacy Policy applies to personal information collected by Company when you use our Site and/or Krisp, or otherwise provide us with personal information. Please read it carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your personal information and how we will treat it. If you do not agree with our Privacy Policy, please do not download, install, register with, access, or use the Site and/or Krisp. Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to Krisp for Enterprises product users, and their End Users (as such terms are defined in our [Privacy Policy for Enterprises](https://krisp.ai/privacy-policy-for-enterprises/)) and access to and use of Krisp and the Site by such parties is subject to our Privacy Policy for Enterprises.

**IF YOU ARE AN INDIVIDUAL LOCATED IN THE EEA**: If you are located in the European Economic Area (“**EEA**”), this entire Privacy Policy applies to you. However, please see the section titled [Additional Information for Users in the EEA](https://krisp.ai/privacy-policy/#additional-information-for-users-in-the-eea-and-the-uk), which will inform you in detail about our legal bases for processing and your rights regarding the processing of your personal data.

### **WHO WE ARE**

Company is a Delaware corporation with the following corporate information:

Krisp Technologies, Inc.   
2150 Shattuck Ave, Penthouse 1300, Berkeley, CA 94704, United States 

For users in the EEA and the U.K., note that we may collect your personal data as:

* A “data controller” when we determine the means and purpose of processing, such as when we process the personal data of our Site visitors and/or customers, or as
* A “data processor” when we collect and process personal data of Authorized Users on behalf of our Customers who use Krisp.

When we act as a ‘data processor’, our Customers are primarily responsible for making sure that they have properly informed Authorized Users of their policies and practices and your rights. However, Company handles and secures your personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy (except as noted otherwise in this Privacy Policy).

### **CHILDREN’S PRIVACY**

Company does not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 16. If you are under the age of 16, please do not submit any personal data to us. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never to provide personal data without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 16 has provided personal data to Company through the Site or Krisp, please contact [\[email protected\]](https://krisp.ai/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.

### **CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY**

This Privacy Policy was last updated on the date indicated above, but we suggest that you review it from time to time, as our Site and/or Krisp and our business may change. As a result, at times it may be necessary for the Company to make changes to this Privacy Policy. Company reserves the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time and from time to time without prior notice. However, if an update materially impacts your rights or how we use your personal information, we will notify you either by email or other direct communication before such updates take effect.

* **Site Visitors**: visitors to our Site, including those who may also opt-in to receive commercial communications from Company.
* **Authorized Users**: Company processes Authorized User data on behalf of its Customers. While our Customers are responsible, as data controllers, for how and why they collect and process their Authorized User personal information, this Privacy Policy also applies to any Authorized User personal information that we process, as a data processor, in order to provide Krisp to our Customers, except where specifically indicated.
* **Other Individuals**: Company also collects certain professional information from third parties about individuals with whom we do not have a direct relationship or individuals who contact us to get more information about Krisp.

THE CUSTOMER, RATHER THAN COMPANY, CONTROLS HOW SUCH CONTENT IS PROCESSED. ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROCESSING OF SUCH CONTENT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED TO THE CUSTOMER DIRECTLY.**

**WE HAVE [ROBUST ACCESS CONTROLS](https://krisp.ai/security-for-ai-meeting-assistant/) TO PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO RECORDINGS AND/OR MEETING NOTES STORED ON COMPANY SERVERS.

We may also ask you to submit personal information if you choose to use interactive features of the Site and/or Krisp, including participation in research studies, surveys, promotions, requesting customer support, or otherwise communicating with us. For example, if you participate in a research study or survey, we may record your participation and feedback. In accordance with the consent provided by your device or other third-party API, we may process any contact information that you choose to provide us access to when using the Site and/or Krisp. We may also ask you for information when you interact with us (such as when responding to notices and announcements from us), and when you report a problem with Krisp and/or the Site or otherwise correspond with us.

#### Information We Collect Indirectly

When you download, use or interact with the Site, even if you do not have an account, we, or authorized third parties engaged by us, may automatically collect information about your use of the Site via your device. This information is collected via cookies and similar technologies (“Device and Usage Information”) and consists of:

_Information from Third Parties_

In some instances, we process personal information from third parties. This consists of data from our partners, such as transactional data from providers of payment services, or information from third parties who assist us with fraud prevention. We also collect information from third parties about Other individuals with whom we do not have a direct relationship. This information consists of business or professional information and includes name and email address, along with information such as title and company name, and we use this information for our marketing purposes.

From time to time, we may combine information we collect as described above with personal information we obtain from third parties. For example, we may combine information entered through a Company sales submission with information that we receive from a third-party sales intelligence platform to enhance our ability to market Krisp to Customers or potential Customers.

We may receive information about you when you integrate third-party apps, or link a third-party service with Krisp. ​​If you decide to activate an integration, the third-party may share with us some information about you that is required to ensure your experience is more seamless, such as your name, email address, or other content or information needed to facilitate the integration. For example, you may authorize Krisp to connect with a third-party calendaring service or to sync a contact list or address book so that your meetings and connections are available to you through Krisp. We may share such information with our third party service providers for the sole purpose of providing Krisp to you and only in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. The information we receive when you link or integrate Krisp with a third-party service depends on the settings, permissions and privacy policy controlled by that third-party service. You should always check the privacy settings and notices in these third-party services to understand what data may be disclosed to us or shared with Krisp. Additionally, if you sign up or login to Krisp using a third party authentication provider supported by us, we may collect authentication information provided to us by such a provider to allow you to log in. Please note, that no information obtained through such third-party apps or services (e.g. Google Workspace APIs) is used to develop, improve, or train generalized AI and/or ML models. Additionally, when obtaining information

Krisp does not respond to Do Not Track (“DNT”) browser signals. For more information on DNT settings generally, please visit [https://allaboutdnt.com](https://allaboutdnt.com/) .

### **HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?**

_General Retention Periods_

We use the following criteria to determine our retention periods:

* The amount, nature and sensitivity of your information.
* The reasons for which we collect and process the personal data.
* The length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide you with access to our Site and/or Krisp.
* Applicable legal requirements.

We retain personal information for as long as needed to provide Krisp. Note, however, that with respect to our Customers with active accounts, we may retain certain essential account information, but otherwise regularly delete other information that is less essential to the provision of Krisp in order to minimize our storage of data. We also will retain personal information that we’ve collected from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements). Additionally, we cannot delete information when it is needed for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims (also known as a “litigation hold”). In this case, the information must be retained as long as needed for exercising respective potential legal claims. When we no longer have an ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible. For any questions about data retention, please contact [\[email protected\]](https://krisp.ai/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

_Anonymization_

In some instances, we may choose to anonymize your personal data instead of deleting it, for statistical use, for instance. When we choose to anonymize, we make sure that there is no way that the personal data can be linked back to you or any specific user.

### **OPTING-OUT OF MARKETING**

You may opt-out at any time of marketing that we may send you by clicking on the unsubscribe link contained in each email, or you may contact us directly at [\[email protected\]](https://krisp.ai/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

### **NOTICE TO NEVADA CONSUMERS**

We do not sell your personal information within the scope of, and according to the defined meaning of, a “sale” under NRS 603A.

### **INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS**

Company is a United States corporation, which primarily stores information in the United States. To facilitate our global operations, we may process personal information from around the world, including from other countries and in other countries in which Company has operations, in order to provide the Site and/or Krisp.

**If you are accessing or using our Site and/or Krisp or otherwise providing personal information to us, you are agreeing and consenting to the processing of your personal information in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we operate.**

If you are a Customer, you are responsible for informing your Authorized Users of how and where their personal information will be processed at the time of collection. Because different countries may have different data protection laws than the United States we take steps to ensure adequate safeguards are in place to protect your data as explained in this Privacy Policy. We enter into data processing agreements with our Customers on request.

### **ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR USERS IN THE EEA AND THE U.K.**

#### Rights and Choices

If the GDPR applies to you because you are in the EEA or the U.K., you have certain rights in relation to your personal data:

* The right to be informed: our obligation to inform you that we process your personal data (and that’s what we’re doing in this Privacy Policy)
* The right of access: your right to request a copy of the personal data we hold about you (also known as a ‘data subject access request’)
* The right of rectification: your right to request that we correct personal data about you if it is incomplete or inaccurate (though we generally recommend first making any changes in your Account Settings)
* The right to erasure (also known as the ‘right to be forgotten’): under certain circumstances, you may ask us to delete the personal data we have about you (unless it remains necessary for us to continue processing your personal data for a legitimate business need or to comply with a legal obligation as permitted under the GDPR, in which case we will inform you)
* The right to restrict processing: your right, under certain circumstances, to ask us to suspend our processing of your personal data
* The right to data portability: your right to ask us for a copy of your personal data in a common format (for example, a .csv file)
* The right to object: your right to object to us processing your personal data (for example, if you object to us processing your data for direct marketing)
* Rights in relation to automated decision-making and profiling: our obligation to be transparent about any profiling we do, or any automated decision-making. These rights are subject to certain rules around when you can exercise them.

How you may exercise these rights depends on how you use the Site and/or Krisp, as explained below. For Authorized Users in the EEA or the U.K., please read below.

_Customers, Site Visitors in the EEA or the U.K._

If you are located in the EEA or the U.K. and you are a Customer or Site Visitor, and wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, you may contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://krisp.ai/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) using the term “DSR” as your email subject line. You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights) unless your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request under those circumstances. If we cannot reasonably verify your identity, we will not be able to comply with your request(s). We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity. This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. Note that this is especially true when you engage a third party to assist you in exercising your rights. We will respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated as required by law. In addition, we will always balance your rights against those of other data subjects in connection with any requests, and in some cases this may require us to redact our responses or deny a request.

If you no longer wish to receive our marketing/promotional information, we remind you that you may withdraw your consent to direct marketing at any time directly from the unsubscribe link included in each electronic marketing message we send to you. If you do so, we will promptly update our databases, and will take all reasonable steps to meet your request at the earliest possible opportunity, but we may continue to contact you to the extent necessary for the purposes of providing Krisp.

Finally, you have the right to make a complaint at any time to the supervisory authority for data protection issues in your country of residence. We would, however, appreciate the chance to address your concerns before you approach the supervisory authority, so please contact us directly first.

_Authorized Users in the EEA or the U.K._

Company has no direct relationship with Authorized Users. Our Customers are solely responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations with respect to their Authorized Users, and this includes handling all data subject requests. We rely on our Customers to comply with the underlying legal requirements and respond directly to Authorized Users when Authorized Users wish to exercise the rights set forth above. However, if an Authorized User sends a request to Company to access, correct, update, or delete his/her information, we will direct that Authorized User to contact the Customer’s website(s) with which he/she interacted directly, and cooperate with our Customers as required by applicable law in order to ensure that our Customers satisfy their Authorized Users’ requests.

#### **CONTACT US**

If you have questions about data protection, or if you have any requests for resolving issues with your personal data, we encourage you to first contact us so we can reply to you more quickly.
