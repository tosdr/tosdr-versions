At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Travelchime Inc. cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting Travelchime Inc. customer support team.

A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your subscription. You shall provideTravelchime Inc. with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Travelchime Inc. to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.

At any time and without notice, Travelchime Inc. reserves the right to (i) modify Terms of Service of Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.

6\. Fee Changes
---------------

Travelchime Inc., in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.
