* **License to Landmark Properties of Your UGC**.  Except as otherwise described in any applicable Additional Terms (such as a promotion’s official rules), which specifically govern the submission of your UGC, or in our Privacy Policy \[LINK\], you hereby grant Landmark Properties, the non-exclusive, unrestricted, unconditional, unlimited, worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual, and cost-free right and license to use, copy, record, distribute, reproduce, disclose, sell, re-sell, sublicense (through multiple levels), display, publicly perform, transmit, publish, broadcast, translate, make derivative works of, and otherwise use and exploit in any manner whatsoever, all or any portion of your UGC (and derivative works thereof), for any purpose whatsoever in all formats, on or through any means or medium now known or hereafter developed, and with any technology or devices now known or hereafter developed, and to advertise, market, and promote the same.  Without limitation, the granted rights include the right to: (a) configure, host, index, cache, archive, store, digitize, compress, optimize, modify, reformat, edit, adapt, publish in searchable format, and remove such UGC and combine same with other materials, and (b) use any ideas, concepts, know-how, or techniques contained in any UGC for any purposes whatsoever, including developing, producing, and marketing products and/or services.  You understand that in exercising such rights metadata, notices and content may be removed or altered, including copyright management information, and you consent thereto and represent and warrant you have all necessary authority to do so.  In order to further effect the rights and license that you grant to Landmark Properties to your UGC, you also, as permitted by applicable law, hereby grant to Landmark Properties, and agree to grant to Landmark Properties, the unconditional, perpetual, irrevocable right to use and exploit your name, persona, and likeness in connection with any UGC, without any obligation or remuneration to you.  Except as prohibited by law, you hereby waive, and you agree to waive, any moral rights (including attribution and integrity) that you may have in any UGC, even if it is altered or changed in a manner not agreeable to you.  To the extent not waivable, you irrevocably agree not to exercise such rights (if any) in a manner that interferes with any exercise of the granted rights.  You understand that you will not receive any fees, sums, consideration, or remuneration for any of the rights granted in this Section 2.A(iii).
* **Landmark Properties’ Exclusive Right to Manage Our Service**.  Landmark Properties may, but will not have any obligation to, review, monitor, display, post, store, maintain, accept, or otherwise make use of, any of your UGC, and Landmark Properties may, in its sole discretion, reject, delete, move, re-format, remove or refuse to post or otherwise make use of UGC without notice or any liability to you or any third-party in connection with our operation of UGC venues in an appropriate manner, such as to enhance accessibility of UGC, address copyright infringement and protect Users from harmful UGC.  Without limitation, we may, but do not commit to, do so to address content that comes to our attention that we believe is offensive, obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, violent, harassing, threatening, abusive, illegal or otherwise objectionable or inappropriate, or to enforce the rights of third parties or these Terms or any applicable Additional Terms.  Such UGC submitted by you or others need not be maintained on the Service by us for any period of time, and you will not have the right, once submitted, to access, archive, maintain, change, remove, or otherwise use such UGC on the Service or elsewhere, except that California minors have certain rights to have certain content about them that they have themselves posted on the Service prospectively removed from public display as provided for in the Privacy Policy \[LINK\].
* **Representations and Warranties Related to Your UGC**.  Each time you submit any UGC, you represent and warrant that you are at least the age of majority in the jurisdiction in which you reside and are the parent or legal guardian, or have all proper consents from the parent or legal guardian, of any minor who is depicted in or contributed to any UGC you submit, and that, as to that UGC, (a) you are the sole author and owner of the Intellectual Property and other rights to the UGC, or you have a lawful right to submit the UGC and grant Landmark Properties the rights to it that you are granting by these Terms and any applicable Additional Terms, all without any Landmark Properties obligation to obtain consent of any third-party and without creating any obligation or liability of Landmark Properties; (b) the UGC is accurate; (c) the UGC does not and, as to Landmark Properties’ permitted uses and exploitation set forth in these Terms, will not infringe any Intellectual Property or other right of any third-party; and (d) the UGC will not violate these Terms or any applicable Additional Terms, or cause injury or harm to any person.

**Community Usage Rules**.  As a user of the Service, these Community Usage Rules (“**Rules**”) are here to help you understand the conduct that is expected of members of the Service’s online communities (“**Communities**”).

* **Nature of Rules**.  Your participation in the Communities is subject to all of the Terms, including these Rules:
    
    * Your UGC.  All of your UGC either must be original with you or you must have all necessary rights in it from third parties in order to permit you to comply with these Terms and any applicable Additional Terms.  Your UGC should not contain any visible logos, phrases, or trademarks that belong to third parties.  Do not use any UGC that belongs to other people and pass it off as your own; this includes any content that you might have found elsewhere on the Internet.  If anyone contributes to your UGC or has any rights to your UGC, or if anyone appears or is referred to in the UGC, then you must also have their permission to submit such UGC to Landmark Properties.  (For example, if someone has taken a picture of you and your friend, and you submit that photo to Landmark Properties as your UGC, then you must obtain your friend’s and the photographer’s permission to do so.)
    * Speaking of Photos:  No Pictures, Videos, or Images of Anyone Other Than You and Your Friends and Family.  If you choose to submit photos to the Service, link to embedded videos, or include other images of real people, then make sure they are of you or of you and someone you know – and only if you have their express permission to submit it.
    * Act Appropriately.  All of your Service activities must be venue appropriate, as determined by us.  Be respectful of others’ opinions and comments so we can continue to build Communities for everyone to enjoy.  If you think your UGC might offend someone or be embarrassing to someone, then chances are it probably will and it doesn’t belong on the Service.  Cursing, harassing, stalking, insulting comments, personal attacks, gossip, and similar actions are prohibited.  Your UGC must not threaten, abuse, or harm others, and it must not include any negative comments that are connected to race, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or handicap.  Your UGC must not be defamatory, slanderous, indecent, obscene, pornographic, or sexually explicit.  Your UGC must not exploit children under the age of 18.
    * Do Not Use for Commercial or Political Purposes.  Your UGC must not advertise or promote a product or service or other commercial activity, or a politician, public servant, or law.
    * Do Not Use to Solicit or Send Unwanted Communications.  Do not harvest or collect email addresses or other contact information of others from the Service by electronic or other means for the purposes of sending unsolicited emails or other unsolicited communications.  Do not solicit personal information from anyone or solicit passwords or personally identifying information for commercial or unlawful purposes.  This also includes not uploading, posting, transmitting, sharing or otherwise making available any unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, solicitations, promotional materials, “junk mail,” “spam,” “chain letters,” “pyramid schemes,” or any other form of solicitation.
    * Do Not Use for Inappropriate Purposes.  Your UGC must not promote any infringing, illegal, or other similarly inappropriate activity.
    * Be Honest and Do Not Misrepresent Yourself or Your UGC.  Do not impersonate any other person, user, or company, and do not submit UGC that you believe may be false, fraudulent, deceptive, inaccurate, or misleading, or that misrepresents your identity or affiliation with a person or company. In the event you receive anything in consideration from us with respect to your UGC (e.g., coupons, sweepstakes entries, etc.) you represent you will include disclosure of the receipt of this consideration clearly and conspicuously as part of the UGC and include any other disclosures we may require.
    * Others Can See.  We hope that you will use the Communities to exchange information and content and have venue appropriate discussions with other members.  However, please remember that the Communities are public or semi-public and UGC that you submit on the Service within a Community may be accessible and viewable by other users.  Do not submit personally identifying information (e.g., first and last name together, password, phone number, address, credit card number, medical information, email address, or other personally identifiable information or contact information) on Community spaces and take care when otherwise disclosing this type of information to others.
    * Don’t Share Other People’s Personal Information.  Your UGC should not reveal another person’s address, phone number, email address, social security number, credit card number, medical information, financial information, or any other information that may be used to track, contact, or impersonate that individual, unless, and in the form and by the method, specifically requested by Landmark Properties (e.g., an email address to send an email invite to a friend).
    * Don’t Damage the Service or Anyone’s Computers or Other Devices.  Your UGC must not submit viruses, Trojan horses, spyware, or any other technologies or malicious code that could impact the operation of the Service or any computer or other Device.
    
    If you submit UGC that Landmark Properties reasonably believes violates these Rules, then we may take any legally available action that we deem appropriate, in our sole discretion.  However, we are not obligated to take any action not required by applicable law.  We may require, at any time, proof of the permissions referred to above in a form acceptable to us.  Failure to provide such proof may lead to, among other things, the UGC in question being removed from the Service.
    
* Your Interactions With Other Users; Disputes.  You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Service, whether online or offline.  We are not responsible or liable for the conduct or content of any user.  We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor or become involved in disputes between you and other users.  Exercise common sense and your best judgment in your interactions with others (e.g., when you submit any personal or other information) and in all of your other online activities.

**Appropriate Content and Alerting Us of Violations**. We expect UGC to be appropriate for a general audience, but do not undertake to monitor it, and you consent to potentially encountering content you find offensive or inappropriate.  We may include venue and content rules as Additional Terms.  If you discover any content that violates these Terms or any applicable Additional Terms, then you may report it [here](mailto:Privacy@landmarkproperties.com).  For alleged infringements of Intellectual Property rights, see [Section 6](#section-six).

**Availability of Service and Content.**  Landmark Properties, in its sole discretion without advance notice or liability, may immediately suspend or terminate the availability of the Service and/or Content (and any elements and features of them), in whole or in part, for any reason, in Landmark Properties’ sole discretion, and without advance notice or liability.

**CREATING AN ACCOUNT**

**Accounts.** If you register with us or create an account, you are solely responsible and liable for the security and confidentiality of your access credentials and for restricting access to your Device and for all activity under your account. Usernames and passwords must be personal and unique that do not violate the rights of any person or entity, and is not offensive. We may reject the use of any password, username, or email address for any reason in our sole discretion. You are solely responsible for your registration information and for updating and maintaining it.

You will not sell, transfer, or assign your account or any account rights.

Accounts may only be set up by an authorized representative of the individual that is the subject of the account and who is of the age of majority. We do not review accounts for authenticity, and are not responsible for any unauthorized accounts that may appear on the Service. For any dispute as to account creation or authenticity, we shall have the sole right, but are not obligated, to resolve such dispute as we determine appropriate, without notice.

Your Profile Page may not include any form of prohibited UGC, as outlined in [Section 2](#section-two) above and in our [Rules](#section-twob).  Without limiting the foregoing, Profile Pages may not include content regarding goods or services that you are attempting to sell through the Service and cannot be used to conduct commercial activities, including, but not limited to, transactions, advertising, fundraising, contests or other promotions, absent our prior written consent.  We may offer you the ability to set preferences relating to your profile or Service activities, but settings may not become effective immediately or be error free and options may change from time-to-time.  We assume no responsibility or liability for users’ profile material. Your profile information, including your photo, may be used by us for identity management and fraud prevention on and off the Service.

Profile Pages may only be set up by an authorized representative of the individual that is the subject of the Profile Page.  We do not review Profile Pages to determine if they were created by an appropriate party, and we are not responsible for any unauthorized Profile Pages that may appear on the Service.  If there is any dispute as to whether a Profile Page has been created or is being maintained by an authorized representative of the individual who is the subject of that Profile Page, then we shall have the sole right, but are not obligated, to resolve such dispute as we determine is appropriate, in our sole discretion.  Such resolution may include, without limitation, deleting or disabling access to Profile Pages, or any portion thereof, at any time, without notice.

**WIRELESS, MESSAGING AND LOCATION-BASED FEATURES**

**Wireless Features.**  The Service may offer certain features and services via your wireless Device.  Features and services may include the ability to access the Service’s features, upload content to the Service, receive messages from the Service, and download applications to your wireless Device (collectively, “**Wireless Features**”).  You agree to receive communications we may send through Wireless Features for which you are registered.  Further, we may collect information related to your use of the Wireless Features.  If you have registered via the Service for Wireless Features, then you agree to notify Landmark Properties of any changes to your wireless contact information (including phone number) and update your accounts on the Service to reflect the changes.  These notifications, including badge, alert or pop-up messages, may be delivered to your Device even when the Service is running in the background.  You may have the ability, and it is your responsibility, to adjust the notifications you do, or do not, receive via your Device through your Device and/or App settings.  Standard message, data and other fees may be charged by your carrier, and carriers may deduct charges from pre-paid amounts or data allowances for which you are responsible.  Your carrier may prohibit or restrict certain Wireless Features and certain Wireless Features may be incompatible with your carrier or wireless Device. Contact your carrier with questions regarding these issues.

**Email Messages.**  You may cancel or modify our email marketing communications you receive from us by following the instructions contained within our promotional emails.  This will not affect subsequent subscriptions and, if your opt-out is limited to certain types of emails, the opt-out will be so limited.  Subject to applicable law, we reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to your account or use of our Service, such as administrative and service announcements, and these informational or transactional account messages may be unaffected if you choose to opt-out from receiving our marketing communications.

**Text Messages.** You may be given opportunities to subscribe to various text marketing or other text messaging programs and, by doing so, you consent to receive ongoing text alerts (including via actual or potential auto-dialers) from us related to our various businesses and affiliates, which may include co-promotions with or about other parties, except that if the scope of your consent for a particular subscription is limited, that subscription will be so limited.  Such consent is not required to purchase any product or service aside from the text subscription itself.  For each subscription, text “HELP” for help and text “STOP” to terminate (i.e., opt-out of) that subscription.  Subsequent or different subscriptions will be unaffected by an opt-out.  You consent to receive a text confirming any opt-out as well as non-marketing administrative or transactional messages.  For subscriptions to recurring text messages, you may receive up to the number of text messages per month specified in your consent or to which you later consent (to the extent specified).  Alerts auto-renew unless otherwise specified when you consented. Except for the purchase of premium text programs to which you subscribe for a fee, your consent to receive text messages is not a condition of any purchase, and no purchase is necessary. You understand that we may send mobile text messages using automated technology. If you subscribe to text messages, you represent that you are 18 years of age or older or have obtained parental consent.  Standard message, data and other fees may be charged by your carrier, and carriers may deduct charges from pre-paid amounts or data allowances for which you are responsible.  Contact your carrier for details. Premium rates that we charge (if any) for text messages will be explained in the applicable subscription consent.  Not all phones and/or carriers are supported.  We are the sponsor of our text messages.

**PROCEDURE FOR ALLEGING COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT**

If you are a copyright owner who would like to send us a notice pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“**DMCA**”) to identify content or material posted on the Service that is infringing that you would like removed from our Service, or if you are a user whose work has been removed in response to such a notice of infringement and would like to file a DMCA counter-notice, you may submit such notice to us by following the instructions [here](#section-sixa).

DMCA Notice.  Landmark Properties asks our users to respect the intellectual property rights of others.  It is our policy to respond appropriately to clear notices of alleged copyright infringement, as set forth more fully below.  In Landmark Properties’ sole discretion, Landmark Properties may remove content that may be infringing on another person’s intellectual property rights with or without notice to the potential infringer.  In accordance with the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) and other applicable law, Landmark Properties has adopted a policy of terminating, in appropriate circumstances, users who are deemed to be repeat infringers.

If we remove or disable access in response to a DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice, we will make a good faith attempt to contact the owner or administrator of the affected content so that they may make a counter-notification.  If you own a copyright in a work (or represent such a copyright owner) and believe that your (or such owner’s) copyright in that work has been infringed by an improper posting or distribution of it via the Service, then you may send us a written notice that includes all of the following:

* a legend or subject line that says: “DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice”;
* a description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed or, if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works;
* a description of where the material that you claim is infringing or is the subject of infringing activity is located that is reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material (please include the full URL of the page(s) on the Service on which the material appears);
* your full name, address, telephone number, and email address;
* a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;
* a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that all the information in your notice is accurate, and that you are the copyright owner (or, if you are not the copyright owner, then your statement must indicate that you are authorized to act on the behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed); and
* your electronic or physical signature.

Landmark Properties will only respond to DMCA Notices that it receives by mail or email at the addresses below:

By Mail:Landmark Properties

 315 Oconee Street,

 Athens, GA 30601

 (Attn: Amanda Henningsen/DMCA)

By Email:amanda.henningsen@landmarkproperties.com

For more information call: 706-543-1910

It is often difficult to determine if your copyright has been infringed.  Landmark Properties may elect to not respond to DMCA Notices that do not substantially comply with all of the foregoing requirements, and Landmark Properties may elect to remove allegedly infringing material that comes to its attention via notices that do not substantially comply with the DMCA.

Please note that the DMCA provides that any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing may be subject to liability.

We may send the information that you provide in your notice to the person who provided the allegedly infringing work.  That person may elect to send us a DMCA Counter-Notification.

Without limiting Landmark Properties’ other rights, Landmark Properties may, in appropriate circumstances, terminate a repeat infringer’s access to the Service and any other website owned or operated by Landmark Properties.

**Counter-Notification**.  If access on the Service to a work that you submitted to Landmark Properties is disabled or the work is removed as a result of a DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice, and if you believe that the disabled access or removal is the result of mistake or misidentification, then you may send us a DMCA Counter-Notification to the addresses above.  Your DMCA Counter-Notification should contain the following information:

* a legend or subject line that says: “DMCA Counter-Notification”;
* a description of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled (please include the full URL of the page(s) on the Service from which the material was removed or access to it disabled);
* a statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled;
* your full name, address, telephone number, email address, and the username of your Account;
* a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located (or, if the address is located outside the U.S.A., to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Central District of California), and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided DMCA notification to us or an agent of such person; and
* your electronic or physical signature.

Please note that the DMCA provides that any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification may be subject to liability.

If we receive a DMCA Counter-Notification, then we may replace the material that we removed (or stop disabling access to it) in not less than ten (10) and not more than fourteen (14) business days following receipt of the DMCA Counter-Notification.  However, we will not do this if we first receive notice at the addresses above that the party who sent us the DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice has filed a lawsuit asking a court for an order restraining the person who provided the material from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on the Service.  You should also be aware that we may forward the Counter-Notification to the party who sent us the DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice.

**NOTICES, QUESTIONS AND CUSTOMER SERVICE**

You agree that we may give you notices or otherwise respond to you by mail or to your email (if we have it on file) or in any other manner reasonably elected by us.  All legal notices to us must be sent to: 315 Oconee Street, Athens, GA 30601 (Attn: Legal Department). If you have a question regarding the Service, you may contact Landmark Properties Customer Support by sending an email [here](mailto:Privacy@landmarkproperties.com) or calling us at 706-543-1910. You acknowledge that we have no obligation to provide you with customer support of any kind and that customer service personnel cannot change or waive Terms or applicable Additional Terms.

**ARBITRATION AND DISPUTE TERMS**

**Forum Selection/Jurisdiction.**  Jurisdiction and venue for any controversy, allegation, or claim arising out of or relating to the Service, the Content, your UGC, these Terms, or any applicable Additional Terms, (collectively, “**Dispute**”) shall be in Athens-Clarke County, Georgia. Each party submits to personal jurisdiction and venue in Athens-Clarke County, Georgia for any and all purposes.

**Pre-Arbitration Notification.**  Landmark Properties and you agree that it would be advantageous to discuss and hopefully resolve any Disputes before formal proceedings are initiated; provided, however, that Landmark Properties need not do so in circumstances where its claims of Intellectual Property rights are concerned (“**IP Disputes**,” with all other disputes referred to as “**General Disputes**”). The party making a claim – whether you or Landmark Properties – shall send a letter to the other side briefly summarizing the claim and the request for relief. If Landmark Properties is making a claim, the letter shall be sent, via email, to the email address listed in your Landmark Properties account, if applicable. If no such information exists or if such information is not current, then we have no notification or delay obligations under this Section 8.B.  If you are making a claim, the letter shall be sent to 315 Oconee Street, Athens, GA 30601 (Attn: Legal Department). If the Dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after notification, the claimant may proceed to initiate proceedings as set forth in this Section 8. Either you or Landmark Properties, however, may seek provisional remedies (such as preliminary injunctive relief, subject to Section 8.D) before the expiration of this sixty (60)-day period.

**Arbitration of Claims.** All actions or proceedings arising in connection with, touching upon or relating to any controversy, allegation, or claim arising out of or relating to the service, these terms, or the scope of the provisions of this section (collectively, “**Dispute**”), shall be submitted to the American Arbitration Association (“**AAA**”) for final and binding arbitration, to be held in Athens-Clarke County, Georgia. Arbitration shall be conducted pursuant to the Consumer Arbitration Rules then prevailing at the AAA if the dispute is with an individual consumer and pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules then prevailing at the AAA for all other disputes. If the Dispute has a claimed value of not more than $100,000, then the arbitration will be heard and determined by a single neutral arbitrator who is a retired judge or a lawyer with not less than fifteen (15) years’ experience as a practicing member of the bar in the substantive practice area related to the Dispute.  If the Dispute has a claimed value of more than $100,000, or if Landmark Properties elects in its sole discretion to bear the costs of arbitration in excess of those that would occur for a proceeding before a single neutral arbitrator, then the arbitration will be heard and determined by a three-member panel, with one member to be selected by each party and the third (who will be chair of the panel) selected by the two party-appointed members or by the AAA. We may have the right to pay the AAA fees if required for arbitration to be enforceable. The arbitration shall be a confidential proceeding, closed to the general public; provided, however, that a party may disclose information relating to the arbitration proceedings to its and its affiliates’ lawyers, insurance providers, auditors and other professional advisers.  The fact that there is a dispute between the parties that is the subject of arbitration shall be confidential to the same extent. The arbitrator shall issue a written opinion stating the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator’s award is based.  Neither party shall be entitled or permitted to commence or maintain any action in a court of law with respect to any matter in dispute until such matter shall have been submitted to arbitration as herein provided and then only for the enforcement of the arbitrator’s award; provided, however, that prior to the appointment of the arbitrator or for remedies beyond the jurisdiction of an arbitrator, at any time, either party may seek pendente lite relief (subject to the provisions of these terms waiving or limiting that relief) in a court of competent jurisdiction in Athens-Clarke County, Georgia or, if sought by Landmark Properties, such other court that may have jurisdiction over you, without thereby waiving its right to arbitration of the dispute or controversy under this section; provided further, however, that the losing party shall have fifteen (15) business days after the issuance of the arbitrator’s decision to fully comply with such decision, after which the prevailing party may enforce such decision by a petition to any court having jurisdiction over you, which may be made ex parte, for confirmation and enforcement of the award.

**Limitation on Injunctive Relief**. AS PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU CLAIM THAT YOU HAVE INCURRED ANY LOSS, DAMAGES, OR INJURIES IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, THEN THE LOSSES, DAMAGES, AND INJURIES WILL NOT BE DEEMED IRREPARABLE OR SUFFICIENT TO ENTITLE YOU TO AN INJUNCTION OR TO OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF OF ANY KIND.  THIS MEANS (WITHOUT LIMITATION) THAT, IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR CLAIM, YOU AGREE THAT YOU WILL NOT SEEK, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT BE PERMITTED TO OBTAIN, ANY COURT OR OTHER ACTION THAT MAY INTERFERE WITH OR PREVENT THE DEVELOPMENT OR EXPLOITATION OF ANY WEBSITE, APPLICATION, CONTENT, UGC, PRODUCT, SERVICE, OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNED, LICENSED, USED, OR CONTROLLED BY ANY LANDMARK PROPERTIES PARTY (DEFINED BELOW) (INCLUDING YOUR LICENSED UGC) OR A LICENSOR OF ANY LANDMARK PROPERTIES PARTY.

**Governing Law.**  These Terms and any applicable Additional Terms, General Disputes and IP Disputes, and any other claim brought by you against Landmark Properties or by Landmark Properties against you pursuant to this Section 8, or otherwise related to the Service, Content, Landmark Properties Licensed Elements, UGC or other Landmark Properties products or services, will be governed by, construed, and resolved in accordance with, the laws of the State of Georgia, U.S.A., without regard to its conflicts of law provisions that might apply the laws of another jurisdiction. This Section 8 shall be governed solely by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §1, et seq., and not by the law of any state, and is enforceable pursuant to its terms on a self-executing basis. You and Landmark Properties agree that we intend that this Section 8 satisfies the “writing” requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act.  This Section 8 can only be amended by mutual agreement.  Either party may seek enforcement of this Section 8 in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall determine any and all challenges to the arbitrability of a claim.

**Class Action Waiver.**  As permitted by applicable law, both you and Landmark Properties waive the right to bring any Dispute as a class, consolidated, representative, collective, or private attorney general action, or to participate in a class, consolidated, representative, collective, or private attorney general action regarding any Dispute brought by anyone else. Notwithstanding any provision in the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures to the contrary, the arbitrator shall not have the authority or any jurisdiction to hear the arbitration as a class, consolidated, representative, or private attorney general action or to consolidate, join, or otherwise combine the Disputes of different persons into one proceeding. Notwithstanding the arbitration provision set forth above, if the provision regarding waiver of class, collective, representative, and private attorney general claims of this Section 8 is found to be void or otherwise unenforceable, any such class, collective, representative, or private attorney general claims must be heard and determined through an appropriate court proceeding, and not in arbitration.

**Jury Waiver.  AS PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL WITH RESPECT TO ALL CLAIMS AND ISSUES ARISING UNDER, IN CONNECTION WITH, TOUCHING UPON OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS, THE BREACH THEREOF AND/OR THE SCOPE OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION, WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT OR TORT, AND INCLUDING ANY CLAIM FOR FRAUDULENT INDUCEMENT THEREOF.**

 **Small Claims Matters**. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either of us may bring qualifying claim of General Dispute (but not IP Disputes) in small claims court, subject to Section 8.F.

The provisions of this Section 8 shall supersede any inconsistent provisions of any prior agreement between the parties. This Section 8 shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding any termination of your use of the Service or these Terms.

**DISCLAIMER OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES**

AS PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS”, “AS AVAILABLE”, AND “WITH ALL FAULTS” BASIS.  To the fullest extent permissible by applicable law, Landmark Properties and their direct and indirect parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, and each of their respective employees, directors, members, managers, shareholders, agents, vendors, licensors, licensees, contractors, customers, successors, and assigns (collectively, “**Landmark Properties Parties**”) hereby disclaim and make no representations, warranties, endorsements, or promises, express or implied, in connection with, or otherwise directly or indirectly related to, without limitation, the Service, Content, Landmark Properties Licensed Elements, UGC or other Landmark Properties products or services, except as set forth in subsection C, below.

**EXCEPT FOR ANY SPECIFIC WARRANTIES PROVIDED HEREIN, OR IN APPLICABLE ADDITIONAL TERMS, OR AS OTHERWISE REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LANDMARK PROPERTIES PARTIES HEREBY FURTHER DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES, TITLE, CUSTOM, TRADE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, SYSTEM INTEGRATION AND FREEDOM FROM COMPUTER VIRUS.**

**NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THIS SECTION DOES NOT EXPAND OR LIMIT (I) ANY EXPRESS, WRITTEN PRODUCT WARRANTY OR RELATED DISCLAIMERS THAT ARE PROVIDED BY LANDMARK PROPERTIES PARTIES OR THEIR SUPPLIERS WITH REGARD TO A PHYSICAL PRODUCT SOLD BY LANDMARK PROPERTIES PARTIES TO YOU, OR ANY WARRANTY ON A PHYSICAL PRODUCT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW; (II) LANDMARK PROPERTIES PARTIES’ LIABILITY  FOR PERSONAL INJURY TO YOU CAUSED BY LANDMARK PROPERTIES PARTIES TO THE EXTENT NOT WAIVABLE OR CANNOT BE LIMITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW; OR (III) ANY CAUSE OF ACTION YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST LANDMARK PROPERTIES PARTIES THAT IS NOT WAIVABLE OR CANNOT BE LIMITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.**

**LIMITATIONS OF OUR LIABILITY**

**AS PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL  
****ANY LANDMARK PROPERTIES PARTIES BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR  
ANY LOSS OR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND**, including personal injury or death or for any  
direct, indirect, economic, exemplary, special, punitive, incidental, or consequential losses or damages of any kind, including without limitation loss of profits, in connection with, or otherwise directly or indirectly related to, without limitation the Service, Content _(including any representations made or reasonably implied from the Content that states or otherwise pertain to security, safety, security measures/access controls, courtesy or afterhours officers, or the monitoring of any security measures/access controls and/or courtesy or after-hours officers),…., except, to the extent not waivable under applicable law, for direct damages for personal injury caused by a physical product manufactured, sold or provided by Landmark Properties. No representations, warranties, or guarantees of safety or security are made, in any fashion, by Landmark Properties Parties through the Service, Content, Landmark Properties Licensed Elements, UGC or other Landmark Properties products or services._

**AS PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LANDMARK PROPERTIES PARTIES’ TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU, FOR ALL POSSIBLE DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND CAUSES OF ACTION IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICE AND YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THESE TERMS, EXCEED AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID LANDMARK PROPERTIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTION(S) THAT UNDERLIE THE CLAIM(S).**

**NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THIS SECTION DOES NOT EXPAND OR LIMIT (I) ANY EXPRESS, WRITTEN PRODUCT WARRANTY OR RELATED DISCLAIMERS THAT ARE PROVIDED BY LANDMARK PROPERTIES PARTIES OR THEIR SUPPLIERS WITH REGARD TO A PHYSICAL PRODUCT SOLD BY LANDMARK PROPERTIES PARTIES TO YOU, OR ANY WARRANTY ON A PHYSICAL PRODUCT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW; (II) LANDMARK PROPERTIES PARTIES’ LIABILITY  FOR PERSONAL INJURY TO YOU CAUSED BY LANDMARK PROPERTIES PARTIES TO THE EXTENT NOT WAIVABLE OR CANNOT BE LIMITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW; OR (III) ANY CAUSE OF ACTION YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST LANDMARK PROPERTIES PARTIES THAT IS NOT WAIVABLE OR CANNOT BE LIMITED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.**

**UPDATES TO TERMS**

It is your responsibility to review the posted Terms and any applicable Additional Terms each time you use the Service (at least prior to each transaction or submission). EACH TIME YOU SIGN IN TO OR OTHERWISE USE THE SERVICE YOU ARE ENTERING INTO A NEW AGREEMENT WITH US ON THE THEN APPLICABLE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY NOTIFY YOU OF NEW TERMS BY POSTING THEM ON THE SERVICE (OR IN ANY OTHER REASONABLE MANNER OF NOTICE WHICH WE ELECT), AND THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE AFTER SUCH NOTICE CONSTITUTES YOUR GOING FORWARD AGREEMENT TO THE NEW TERMS FOR YOUR NEW USE AND TRANSACTIONS.  Any new Terms or Additional Terms will be effective as to new use and transactions as of the time that we post them, or such later date as may be specified in them or in other notice to you.  In the event any notice to you of new, revised, or additional terms is determined by a tribunal to be insufficient, the prior agreement shall continue until sufficient notice to establish a new agreement occurs.  You can reject any new, revised or additional terms by discontinuing use of the Service.

**GENERAL PROVISIONS**

**Landmark Properties’ Consent or Approval.**  As to any provision in these Terms or any applicable Additional Terms that grants Landmark Properties a right of consent or approval, or permits Landmark Properties to exercise a right in its “sole discretion,” Landmark Properties may exercise that right in its sole and absolute discretion.  No Landmark Properties consent or approval may be deemed to have been granted by Landmark Properties without being in writing and signed by an officer of Landmark Properties.

**Indemnity**.  As permitted by applicable law, you agree to, and you hereby, defend (if requested by Landmark Properties), indemnify, and hold Landmark Properties Parties harmless from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, costs, investigations, liabilities, judgments, fines, penalties, settlements, interest, and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) that directly or indirectly arise from or are related to any claim, suit, action, demand, or proceeding made or brought against any Landmark Properties Party, or on account of the investigation, defense, or settlement thereof, arising out of or in connection with: (i) your UGC; (ii) your use of the Service and your activities in connection with the Service; (iii) your breach or alleged breach of these Terms or any applicable Additional Terms; (iv) your violation or alleged violation of any laws, rules, regulations, codes, statutes, ordinances, or orders of any governmental or quasi-governmental authorities in connection with your use of the Service or your activities in connection with the Service; (v) information or material transmitted through your Device, even if not submitted by you, that infringes, violates, or misappropriates any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress, patent, publicity, privacy, or other right of any person or entity; (vi) any misrepresentation made by you; and (vii) Landmark Properties Parties’ use of the information that you submit to us (including your UGC) subject to our [Privacy Policy](https://www.landmarkproperties.com/privacy-policy/) (all of the foregoing, “**Claims and Losses**”).  You will cooperate as fully required by Landmark Properties Parties, in the defense of any Claim and Losses.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landmark Properties Parties retain the exclusive right to settle, compromise, and pay any and all Claims and Losses.  Landmark Properties Parties reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any Claims and Losses.  You will not settle any Claims and Losses without, in each instance, the prior written consent of an officer of a Landmark Properties Party. This section is not intended to limit any causes of action against us that you may have but are not waivable under applicable law.

**Operation of Service; Availability of Products and Services; International Issues.**  Landmark Properties controls and operates the Service from the U.S.A., and makes no representation that the Service is appropriate or available for use beyond the U.S.A.  If you use the Service from other locations, you are doing so on your own initiative and responsible for compliance with applicable local laws regarding your online conduct and acceptable content, if and to the extent local laws apply.

**Export Controls.**  You are responsible for complying with all applicable trade regulations and laws both foreign and domestic.  Except as authorized by U.S. law, you agree and warrant not to export or re-export the software to any county, or to any person, entity, or end-user subject to U.S. export controls or sanctions.

**Severability; Interpretation.**  If any provision of these Terms, or any applicable Additional Terms, is for any reason deemed invalid, unlawful, void, or unenforceable by a court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms or the applicable Additional Terms, and the invalidity of the provision will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of these Terms or the applicable Additional Terms.  To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to waive and will waive, any applicable statutory and common law that may permit a contract to be construed against its drafter.

**Investigations; Cooperation with Law Enforcement; Termination; Survival.** As permitted by applicable law, Landmark Properties reserves the right, without limitation, to: (i) investigate any suspected breaches of its Service security or its information technology or other systems or networks, (ii) investigate any suspected breaches of these Terms and any applicable Additional Terms, (iii) use any information obtained by Landmark Properties in accordance with its [Privacy Policy](https://www.landmarkproperties.com/privacy-policy/) in connection with reviewing law enforcement databases or complying with applicable laws and use and/or disclose any information obtained by Landmark Properties to comply with law enforcement requests or legal requirements in accordance our [Privacy Policy](https://www.landmarkproperties.com/privacy-policy/), (iv) involve and cooperate with law enforcement authorities in investigating any of the foregoing matters, (v) prosecute violators of these Terms and any applicable Additional Terms, and (vi) discontinue the Service, in whole or in part, or, suspend or terminate your access to it, in whole or in part, including any user accounts or registrations, at any time, without notice, for any reason and without any obligation to you or any third-party.   Any suspension or termination will not affect your obligations to Landmark Properties under these Terms or any applicable Additional Terms.  Upon suspension or termination of your access to the Service, or upon notice from Landmark Properties, all rights granted to you under these Terms or any applicable Additional Terms will cease immediately, and you agree that you will immediately discontinue use of the Service.  The provisions of these Terms and any applicable Additional Terms, which by their nature should survive your suspension or termination will survive, including the rights and licenses you grant to Landmark Properties in these Terms, as well as the indemnities, releases, disclaimers, and limitations on liability and the provisions regarding jurisdiction, choice of law, no class action, and mandatory arbitration.

**Assignment.**  Landmark Properties may assign its rights and obligations under these Terms and any applicable Additional Terms, in whole or in part, to any party at any time without any notice.  These Terms and any applicable Additional Terms may not be assigned by you, and you may not delegate your duties under them, without the prior written consent of an officer of Landmark Properties.

**Complete Agreement; No Waiver.**  These Terms, and any applicable Additional Terms, reflect our complete agreement regarding the Service and supersede any prior agreements, representations, warranties, assurances or discussion related to the Service. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms or any applicable Additional Terms, (i) no failure or delay by you or Landmark Properties in exercising any of rights, powers, or remedies under will operate as a waiver of that or any other right, power, or remedy, and (ii) no waiver or modification of any term of these Terms or any applicable Additional Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by the party against whom the waiver or modification is sought to be enforced.

**California Consumer Rights and Notices.**  California residents can obtain information on our privacy practices, including how we comply with the California Online Privacy Protection Act and the California Shine the Light Act in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.landmarkproperties.com/privacy-policy/) and in our [California Consumer Privacy Notice](https://www.landmarkproperties.com/privacy-policy/#ccpa).
