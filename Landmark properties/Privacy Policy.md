1. **INFORMATION WE COLLECT**
    
    1. **Information about You that You Provide.**
        
        Landmark Properties, and/or its Service Providers (defined below), may collect information you provide directly to Landmark Properties and/or its Service Providers via the Service. For example, Landmark Properties collects information when you use or register for the Service, subscribe to notifications, post on the Service, participate in promotional activities, or communicate or transact through the Service. In addition, when you interact with Third-Party Services (defined below), you may be able to provide information to those third parties. For more information on Third-Party Services’ data collection and practices click [here](https://www.landmarkproperties.com/privacy-policy/#third-party-content). For more information on Service Provider data collection and practices click [here](https://www.landmarkproperties.com/privacy-policy/#info-we-share).
        
        Information Landmark Properties, its Service Providers and/or Third-Party Services may collect includes: (1) personal information, which is information that relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with you or your household, such as your first and last name, e-mail address, phone number, address, Social Security number, government-issued identification number, education or employment information, criminal history, vehicle information, and full payment account number (“**Personal Information**” or “**PI**”); (2) demographic information, such as your gender, age, citizenship, zip code, interests, and recent and upcoming purchases (“**Demographic Information**”); and (3) commercial information such as your apartment preferences, desired budget, lease term, move-in date, and any additional information you wish to provide (“**Commercial Information**”).
        
        “**De–identified information**” i.e., information that cannot reasonably be used to infer information about, or otherwise be linked to, a particular person or household because of the removal or modification of the personally identifiable elements, or the extraction of non-personally identifiable elements including through anonymization, pseudonymization, and/or hashing, is not Personal Information and may be used and shared without obligation to you, except as prohibited by applicable law. We will not attempt to reidentify Personal Information that has been de-identified except to confirm that our de-identification process is sufficient to render the underlying information unlinkable to a particular person or household.
        
    2. **Information Collected Automatically**
        
        Landmark Properties, its Service Providers, and/or Third-Party Services may also automatically collect certain information about you when you access or use the Service (“Usage Information”).

        The methods that may be used on the Service to collect Usage Information include:
        
        * **Log Information**: Log information is data about your use of the Service, such as IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamps, and related data, and may be stored in log files.
        * **Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies**: Cookies, web beacons (also known as “tracking pixels”), embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies, device recognition technologies, device and activity monitoring and other tracking technologies now and hereafter developed (“**Tracking Technologies**”) may be used to collect information about interactions with the Service or e-mails, including information about your browsing and purchasing behavior.
        * Cookies
            * A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s device, which may last for a session or be persistent. Session cookies make it easier for you to navigate the Service and expire when you close your browser. Persistent cookies remain longer and help in understanding how you use the Service and enhance your user experience. Persistent cookies may remain on your hard drive for an extended period of time. If you use your browser’s method of blocking or removing cookies, some but not all types of cookies may be deleted and/or blocked and as a result some features, and functionalities of the Service may not work.
        * Web Beacons (“Tracking Pixels”)
            * Web beacons are small graphic images, also known as “Internet tags” or “clear gifs,” embedded in web pages and e-mail messages. Web beacons may be used, without limitation, to count the number of visitors to the Service, to monitor how users navigate the Service, and to count content view.
        * Embedded Scripts
            * An embedded script is website code designed to collect information about your interactions with the Service. Embedded scripts may run while you are on our website.
        * Location-identifying Technologies
            * Geo-filtering and other location-aware technologies locate you, or make assumptions about your location, for purposes such as verifying your location and delivering or restricting content, including third-party ads, based on your location. If you have enabled GPS or use other location-based features on the Service, your device location may be tracked by us and third parties.
        * Device Recognition Technologies.
            * Technologies, including application of statistical probability to data sets, as well as linking a common unique identifier to different device use (e.g., Facebook ID), which attempt to recognize or make assumptions about users and devices (e.g., that a user of multiple devices is the same user or household) (“**Cross-device Data**”).
        * Device and Activity Monitoring
            * Technologies that monitor, and may record, certain of your interactions with the Service, including without limitation, keystrokes and mouse movements, and/or collect and analyze information from your device, such as, without limitation, your operating system, plug-ins, system fonts, and other data, for purposes such as identification, security, fraud prevention, troubleshooting, tracking and/or improving the Services and customizing or optimizing your experience on the Services. Records of your interactions collected by device and activity monitoring technologies may be disclosed to our vendors for the purposes of analytics, advertising, and Service functionality.

7. **DATA SECURITY AND MONITORING**
    
    Landmark Properties takes reasonable measures to protect Personal Information from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Nevertheless, transmission via the internet and online digital storage are not completely secure and Landmark Properties does not guarantee the security of your information collected through the Service.
    
    To help protect you and others, Landmark Properties and its Service Providers may (but make no commitment to) monitor use of the Service, and may collect and use related information including Personal Information for all purposes not prohibited by applicable law or inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, including, without limitation, to identify fraudulent activities and transactions; prevent abuse of, and investigate and/or seek prosecution for, any potential threats to or misuse of the Service; ensure compliance with the [Terms of Use](https://www.landmarkproperties.com/terms-of-use/) and this Privacy Policy; investigate violations of or enforce these documents; improve the Services and your Services experiences, and to protect the rights and property of Landmark Properties, third parties, and other users.

8. **INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER**
    
    Landmark Properties is based in the U.S. and the information Landmark Properties and its Service Providers collect is governed by U.S. law. If you are located in the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA), and/or Switzerland, please note that Landmark Properties does not intend to offer goods and services (including the Services) to EU, EEA, or Swiss individuals. If you are accessing the Service from outside of the U.S., please be aware that information collected through the Service may be transferred to, processed, stored, and used in the U.S. Data protection laws in the U.S. may be different from those of your country of residence.

11. **Choices: Tracking and Communications Options**
    
    1. **Tracking Technologies Generally**
        
        Cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some instances blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Browsers offer different functionalities and options, so you may need to set them separately. Please be aware that if you disable or remove these technologies, some parts of the Service may not work and that when you revisit the Service your ability to limit browser-based Tracking Technologies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.
        
        In addition, your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to online services you visit. Like many online services, Landmark Properties currently does not alter Landmark Properties’ practices when Landmark Properties receives a “Do Not Track” signal from a visitor’s browser. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” you can visit [www.allaboutdnt.com](http://www.allaboutdnt.com/), but Landmark Properties is not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of this third-party information.

            We do not sell Personal Information in exchange for money, but some of the ways in which we share Personal Information may be considered a sale under the CCPA. We may sell and/or share the following categories of personal information with third parties for the purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising:
            
            * Identifiers
            * Internet or other electronic network activity
            * Geolocation data
            
            We sell and/or share this Personal Information with third parties for advertising purposes. The third parties to whom this Personal Information is sold and/or shared are advertisers and analytics vendors.
            
            California residents may opt out of sales and sharing of your Personal Information as set forth in the “Right to Opt Out of Sales and Sharing of Personal Information” section below.
            
            We do not have actual knowledge that we sell or share the personal information of consumers under sixteen (16) years of age.
            
        6. **California Privacy Rights**

You may make such a designation by providing the agent with written permission to act on your behalf. As permitted by law, we may take steps to verify your own identity in response to a request even if you choose to use an agent.
            
            **Right to Know.** You have the right to know what Personal Information we have collected about you, which includes:

            **Right to Delete Your Personal Information.** You have the right to request that we delete Personal Information we collected from you, subject to certain exceptions.

        7. **Notice of Financial Incentives**
            
            From time to time, Landmark may offer a financial incentive such as a gift card or merchandise to consumers who choose to sign up for additional information about our properties, to register as an active sales lead, to visit one of our properties for a tour, or sign a lease. Participation in these activities requires you to provide some Personal Information, such as your Identifiers and Commercial Information. These incentives are designed to encourage participants to visit our properties or sign a lease.
            
            We have made a good faith estimate that the value of this Personal Information provided in connection with our incentives is equivalent to the relevant expenses related to the collection and retention of that Personal Information. Any difference in price or benefits provided to participants who receive an incentive is reasonably related to the value of the Personal Information provided.
            
            Should you wish to withdraw your participation in any program associated with a financial incentive as described above, please email us at [privacy@landmarkproperties.com](mailto:privacy@landmarkproperties.com), or call us at 1 (888) 914-9661 PIN 493149.

        8. **Third Party Marketing and Your California Privacy Rights**
            
            California’s “Shine the Light” law permits California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of Personal Information to third parties or affiliates for their own direct marketing purposes. We do not share Personal Information with third parties or affiliates for those third parties’ or affiliates’ own direct marketing purposes. Californians may request information about our compliance with this law by contacting us as provided below.

    2. **Nevada**
        
        Although we do not “sell” “covered information” of Nevada “consumers” as those terms are defined by Chapter 603A of the Nevada Revised Statutes, you may contact us [here](mailto:privacy@landmarkproperties.com) and register an e-mail contact address for us to provide you notice in the event we should do so in the future, at which point you will have an opportunity to be verified and exercise your opt-out rights under that law. Contact us in the same manner to update your contact email for notices. Changing your email elsewhere (e.g., informational requests, account information, etc.) will not update your Nevada notice contact information. It is your responsibility to keep your notice contact information current.
        
    3. **Connecticut**
        
        Connecticut law requires any person or entity that collects Social Security numbers from Connecticut residents in the course of business to create a privacy protection policy and to publish or display it publicly. It is our policy to protect the confidentiality of Social Security numbers in our possession from misuse and improper disclosure by maintaining and enforcing policies and physical and electronic safeguards against misuse and improper disclosure. Unlawful disclosure of Social Security numbers is prohibited, and access to them is limited to personnel who need access to such information in order to perform their job functions.
        
13. **Changes to This Privacy Policy**
    
    We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy prospectively effective upon the posting of the revised Privacy Policy and your use of our Service indicates your consent to the privacy policy posted at the time of use. However, we will not treat your previously collected Landmark Properties-Collected PII, to the extent it is not collected under the new privacy policy, in a manner materially different than represented at the time it was collected without your consent. To the extent any provision of this Privacy Policy is found by a competent tribunal to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be severed to the extent necessary for the remainder to be valid and enforceable.
