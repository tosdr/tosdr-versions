###### 

* We collect only data needed to provide Guardio's service and features.
* Our business model is customer payment - any data we have is not for sale!
* We invest a lot in marketing the product, so we do want to save metadata about how users were exposed to Guardio's marketing.
* We are GDPR compliant.
* We use and transfer to any other app of information received from Google APIs will adhere to the [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes), including the Limited Use requirements.
