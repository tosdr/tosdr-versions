**3.5.** Goods available through a “pre-order” may be reserved by paying a reservation fee, where the Seller reserves the right to subsequently adjust the final price of the pre-ordered Goods, especially due to a change in the production costs resulting from unexpected outages in supplies of raw materials, third-party products or interruption of the transport chain. Both the Buyer and the Seller may cancel the reservation of the pre-ordered Goods at any time. In case of withdrawal from a reservation, the Seller shall refund the entire reservation fee to the Buyer without undue delay. For pre-orders, the time of delivery of the Goods is purely indicative; when the Goods are back in stock, the Seller shall inform the Buyer without undue delay and request that the Buyer pay the outstanding amount and confirm the Order.

**3.6.** In case of provision of Digital Content that is not delivered on a tangible medium, the consumer agrees that the performance will commence before expiry of the deadline for withdrawal from a contract; the Buyer acknowledges that upon granting such a consent, the Buyer’s right to withdraw from the contract for the purchase of Digital Content by the consumer without stating a reason expires pursuant to Article 7 of these Terms and Conditions.

**3.7.** The price of the Goods and Digital Content specified in the E-shop includes all taxes and fees that the Seller is obliged to pay in case of a delivery to a consumer in one of the countries of the European Union – “EU” or the European Economic Area – “EEA”.

**3.8.** In case of delivery of Goods or Digital Content to any of the countries of the European Union – “EU” or the European Economic Area – “EEA”, the final price in the Order shall be charged including value added tax (VAT) unless the Buyer (VAT payer in its country) provides the Seller with information on its VAT registration including a valid EU VAT number. More information on VAT accounting is available in our knowledge database at: [VAT (Value Added Tax) and Customs Duties](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/vat-value-added-tax-customs-fees_1505).

More information regarding the delivery of Goods to third countries is available in our knowledge database at: [VAT (Value Added Tax) and Customs Duties](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/vat-value-added-tax-customs-fees_1505). The Seller notes that in this respect, the information provided, including a table of typical taxes, customs duties and other fees set out in the knowledge database, is given as a non-binding estimate of the anticipated total tax and customs duties (for information purposes only) and not as binding determination of the final amount of costs. The final amount of taxes, duties and charges may vary based on the application of the relevant legal regulations at the place of destination and assessment by the competent authorities.

**3.10.** Other costs of delivery of the Goods, including the price for transport to the place of destination chosen by the Buyer, cash-on-delivery and other fees, such as customs duties and other levies (see the provisions of paragraph 3.9. of these Terms and Conditions), are not included in the purchase price of the Goods and depend on the place and method of delivery and the payment method chosen by the Buyer prior to the completion of the Order or at the time of confirmation of the pre-order by the Buyer after being informed that pre-ordered Goods are in stock. If the Seller provides free shipping of the Goods, this fact is expressly stated in the relevant Order.

**3.11.** Payments may be made in Czech crowns (CZK), Euro (EUR), United States dollar (USD), British pound (GBP) or Polish zloty (PLN) or in other currencies that are allowed in the E-shop at the time when the Order is made.

**3.12.** Before completion and submission of the Order and its binding confirmation, the Buyer is always informed of the final contents of the Order and the final price including the price of the Goods and the total costs of delivery of the Goods paid to the Seller. The Seller notes that the final total price of the delivered Goods may be further increased in case of final calculation of customs duties or other import charges charged by the competent authority (see paragraph 3.9. of these Terms and Conditions).

**3.13.** After the Buyer submits the Order, it will be verified by the Seller who will subsequently send its confirmation to the Buyer. The Purchase Contract is concluded upon delivery of the order confirmation sent by the Seller to the Buyer’s e-mail address. The full text of these Terms and Conditions, which forms the contents of the contract between the Seller and the Buyer, is attached to the order confirmation.

**3.14.** The sent Order represents the Buyer’s proposal to enter into a contract on the basis of these Terms and Conditions _vis-à-vis_ the Seller. The order confirmation by the Seller represents acceptance of the proposal by the Seller.

**3.15.** By submitting the Order, the Buyer expresses its consent to these Terms and Conditions, which are always available in the E-shop’s online interface and sent to the Buyer in text form together with the order confirmation.

**3.17.** As long as the user interface allows this in the Order overview, the Buyer may modify, supplement or cancel the Order for the Goods. A change in the Order after its acceptance by the Seller (i.e. after the execution of the Purchase Contract) constitutes a draft amendment to the Purchase Contract by the Buyer and the provisions of paragraph 3.12. of these Terms and Conditions shall apply to the full extent. Therefore, any change in the Order is subject to subsequent acceptance by the Seller on the basis of which an amendment to the Purchase Contract is executed.

If the Goods only have defects that constitute a non-material breach of the Purchase Contract, the Buyer has the right to claim removal of the defect or a reasonable discount on the purchase price.

**8.4.** If the Buyer is a consumer, it may also request the delivery of a new item that is free of defects or repair, unless the chosen manner of removal of the defect is impossible or unreasonably costly compared to the other; this shall be assessed in particular with regard to the significance of the defect, the value that the item would have if it was free of defects and whether the defect can be removed in the alternative manner without significant difficulties for the Buyer. The Seller may refuse to remove a defect if it is impossible or unreasonably costly, in particular with regard to the significance of the defect and the value that the item would have it was free of defects.

**8.5.** If the Buyer is a consumer, the Buyer may request a reasonable discount or withdraw from the contract if

A report of defects must then be resolved, including removal of the defect, without undue delay, but not later than within 30 days of the date of reporting the defects unless the Seller and the Buyer agree on a longer period of time. Expiry of this deadline to no effect shall be deemed a material breach of the purchase contract by the Seller.
