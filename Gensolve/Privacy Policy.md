You have the right to object to our processing of your personal information. We will consider your request in other circumstances as detailed below by contacting us at support@gensolve.com.

Cookies are then sent back to the originating web address on each subsequent visit, or to another web address that recognises that cookie. Cookies are widely used in order to make the Website work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide information to our service team.
