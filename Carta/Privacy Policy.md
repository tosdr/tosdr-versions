Use and disclosure of personal information
------------------------------------------

We may use, process and/or disclose personal information for the following purposes:

* To operate, maintain, and improve the Services. This includes use of other information to support delivery of our services, assist with service requests, monitor for errors, remedy security or technical issues, analyze website and application performances.

* To send information including confirmations, invoices and billing, technical notices, updates, security alerts, and administrative messages.
* To communicate upcoming events and other news about products and services offered by us.
* To communicate and inform you about system updates and important services-related notices, such as privacy and policy update notices or changes in our terms of service. These communications are administrative and you may not opt out of them.
* To send marketing emails related to the Services, which you may opt out of using provided unsubscribe links or the opt-out mechanism in those communications.
* To link or combine user information with other personal information. An example is when we combine the information a company has provided about their shareholders with the information entered by shareholders in their personal portfolios to improve the user experience.
* To protect, investigate, and deter against fraudulent, unauthorized, or illegal activity, including, but not limited to, validating your identity and preventing fraud on your account, and complying with KYC rules and regulations.
* To provide and deliver products and services to our business customers with respect to their employees or investors. An example is when an employee exercises their employee stock options and we provide a tax form to their employer to facilitate compliance with tax laws.
* To facilitate online advertising. Third-party advertising companies and social media companies may use cookies and similar technologies to collect information about your interaction over time across the Services, our communications and other online services, and use that information to serve online ads that they think will interest you.

We may also use and disclose personal information as follows:

* Our business customers’ equity administrators, authorized users and other designated representatives can access information that we hold about the equity information of their employees and investors.
* To comply with laws, lawful requests and legal or regulatory processes.
* To protect the rights, safety and property of Carta, our agents, users, customers, and others. This includes enforcing our agreements, policies, and terms of use, reporting on security breaches, or assisting with investigating and preventing fraud or security issues.
* For instant verification of your bank account information with features you’re utilizing on Carta, we use Plaid Technologies, Inc. (“Plaid”) to gather customer data from financial institutions.  By using these features, you grant us and Plaid the right, power, and authority to act on your behalf to access and transmit your personal and financial information from the relevant financial institution. You agree to your personal and financial information being transferred, stored, and processed by Plaid in accordance with the [Plaid Privacy Policy](https://plaid.com/legal).

We may create, use and share aggregated or anonymized data for any lawful purpose, such as marketing, analytics or research purposes permitted by law.

We may share personal information with acquirers and other relevant participants in business transactions (or negotiations for such transactions) involving a corporate divestiture, merger, consolidation, acquisition, reorganization, sale or other disposition of all or any portion of the business or assets of, or equity interests in, Carta (including, in connection with a bankruptcy or similar proceedings).

We may share other information with third parties in other ways not described in this Privacy Policy when we have consent (either from users or business customers) to do so.

We may share personal information with third party companies or individuals that we engage as service providers to process information and support our business and services. Examples include providers of cloud hosting and storage services, analytics, services, email delivery services and customer support services.

Retention
---------

We generally retain personal information to fulfill the purposes for which we collected it, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements, to establish or defend legal claims, or for fraud prevention purposes. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we may consider factors such as the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

When we no longer require the personal information we have collected about you, we will either delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible. If we anonymize your personal information (so that it can no longer be associated with you), we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

Age Limitations
---------------

Carta does not allow the use of our Services by anyone younger than 18 years old. If you learn that anyone younger than 18 has unlawfully provided us with personal data through the Services, please contact us and we will take steps to delete such information.

Information choices and changes
-------------------------------

Our marketing emails tell you how to “opt out.” If you opt out, we may still send you non-marketing emails. Non-marketing emails include emails about your accounts and our business dealings with you. If at any time you would like to change your communication preferences, we provide unsubscribe links and an opt-out mechanism in those communications for your convenience.

You may send requests about personal information to our [Contact Information](#contact) below. You can request to change contact choices, opt out of our sharing with others, and update your personal information.

You can typically remove and reject cookies from our website with your browser settings. Many browsers are set to accept cookies until you change your settings. If you remove or reject our cookies, it may affect how our website works for you. See our [Cookie Policy](https://carta.com/cookie-policy-eu/) for more information about your choices regarding cookies.

You can update or correct certain personal information in your Carta account. If you are unable to do so on your own, the information is likely controlled by the security issuer and you should contact the security issuer directly to update your information.
