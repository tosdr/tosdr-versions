The Processor party shall impose contractual obligations as required by US Data Protection Laws on such sub-processors, and shall inform the other party in the event of replacing a sub-processor or engaging a new sub-processor.

4.3. Audit: A Controller party has the right to ensure the Processor party is in compliance with US Data Protection Laws. For this purpose, the Processor party, upon receiving a reasonable written request from the Controller party, will make available to the Controller party information necessary to demonstrate compliance with this DPA and US Data Protection Laws. To the extent required by applicable US Data Protection Laws, and upon receiving prior written notice, the Processor party will allow audits, including inspections, by the Controller party (or an auditor on its behalf). Any such audit must be tailored to what is reasonably necessary to verify compliance with this DPA, and must occur during normal business hours, and not more than once per calendar year. The results of the audit will be the confidential information of the Processor party. Notwithstanding the above, under US Data Protection Laws and subject to the Client’s consent, the Processor party may alternately, in response to the Controller party's on-premise audit request to initiate an independent auditing on its own, to verify its compliance with its obligations under US Data Protection Laws and provide the Client with the results. In any case, the expenses of the audit shall be paid by the Controller party. The Processor party may refuse audit or access to certain information if it determines it may harm other partners or customers, or it may cause a security breach, or it is not related or necessary for the purpose of demonstrating compliance with US Data Protection Laws.

4.4. Certification: The Processor party certifies that it understands the rules, requirements, and definitions of the CCPA and agrees to refrain from Selling or Sharing Personal Information. The Processor party acknowledges and confirms that it does not receive any monetary goods, payments, or discounts in exchange for processing the Personal Information for a Business Purpose or Restricted Purpose as specified in the Agreement.
