### 13\. YOUR RIGHTS

You are entitled to a range of rights regarding the protection of your Personal Data. Those rights are:

* the right to access the information we process about you;
* the right to rectify incorrect/inaccurate information about you;
* the right to transfer all or part of the information collected about you to you or another data controller, where technically feasible (the right to data portability; with limitations and restrictions as specified in the EU General Data Protection Regulation);
* the right to erase any data concerning you. Users may demand erasure of data without undue delay for legitimate reasons, e.g. where data is no longer necessary for the purposes it was collected, or where the data has been unlawfully processed;
* the right to the restriction of data processing. Users, for legitimate purposes, may obtain restriction of data processing from the controller;
* the right to object to the processing of Personal Data when processing is carried out on the basis of legitimate interest, as well as in these cases, as specified above in this Policy:
    * use of your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes;
    * use of your Personal Data for profiling for direct marketing purposes.

Some of the rights as above are easy to exercise: i.e., you may at any time access and edit, update or amend your details, opt out of receiving communications from us and our partners by contacting to our Help Desk.

When you object to processing of Personal Data when processing is carried out on the basis of legitimate interest, we will carefully consider such a request, which may result in your Account closure or de-activation.

Users have the right to lodge a complaint with the national Data Protection Agency in their country of residence in the event where their rights may have been infringed. However, we recommend attempting to reach a peaceful resolution of the possible dispute by contacting us first.
