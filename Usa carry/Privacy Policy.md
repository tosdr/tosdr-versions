**USA Carry is owned by USA Carry LLC (“USA Carry”, “we” or “our”).**

Our business is based on our readers’ trust. We want to be transparent about what we do and how we earn money as a company.

We earn money on this site through:

* Sales of our own products
* Affiliate commissions
* Advertising partnerships

### Affiliate Disclosure

We participate in affiliate programs, including (but not limited to) Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn commissions by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites. All of the products for which we receive affiliate commissions are ones that we believe in, and in many cases, have tested ourselves.

### Advertising Disclosure

In the case of advertising partnerships, we only agree to a partnership if we believe in the product and the company itself.

We will display disclaimers on all sponsored content. We may also include, in certain areas, more explanation defining sponsored content to readers. In addition, we will ensure the treatment and design of advertising and sponsored content are clearly separate from our editorial content.

We may reject or remove any sponsored content at any time that contains false, deceptive, potentially misleading, or illegal content; or is inconsistent with or may tend to bring disparagement, harm to reputation, or other damage to the USA Carry brand and its websites.

Content Disclaimer
------------------

NO RENDERING OF ADVICE. Everything on this site is provided for informational purposes. Our content is based on research from books, websites, and our own experience. We make reasonable efforts to make sure the information presented is accurate and up to date, but do not warrant that any of that information is accurate, complete, reliable, error-free, or current. We assume no responsibility for any errors or omissions in any content presented on this site or any other platform we upload content to or any links to any other web resources in any of our content.

Everything you try for yourself should be contingent upon your own research and good judgment. If you’re thinking about making a big change due to content posted here, consider asking a professional’s advice first.

Privacy Policy
--------------

This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and disclose information from users of our websites. Several of our products’ applications and, where applicable, products, have their own additional privacy policy, available in the respective application. This Privacy Policy does not apply to websites, applications, or services that display or link to different privacy statements; in the event of a conflict or inconsistency between this Privacy Policy and a product/application’s privacy policy, the latter will govern.

### 1\. User Consent

By submitting information through our Site, Services, or application, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, as amended from time to time.

### 2\. Privacy Shield and Users Outside the United States

Your information may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United States, where laws regarding processing of information may be less stringent than the laws in your country.

However, we comply with the principles of the Privacy Shield Framework. Our adherence to Privacy Shield reflects our commitment to protect the privacy of our EU users when we collect, process, and transfer personal data collected from users in the EU. We adhere to the Privacy Shield principles of notice, choice, accountability for onward transfer, security, data integrity and purpose limitation, access, and recourse/enforcement/liability.

Furthermore, we require third party recipients of EU citizens’ personal data to agree to respect these principles, and we accept liability for third parties’ processing of EU citizens’ data to the extent required by law.

We encourage EU (and US) users to contact us if they have any concerns about our compliance with this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Framework. Any questions or concerns may be sent to [\[email protected\]](https://www.usacarry.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). We will respond to complaints from EU citizens within 45 days. You may view the list of Privacy Shield companies [here](https://www.privacyshield.gov/list).

If any complaints cannot be resolved between an EU user and USA Carry, we have agreed to participate in the JAMS dispute resolution procedures pursuant to EU-U.S. Privacy Shield principles. EU residents with unresolved complaints may refer them to JAMS as described at https://www.jamsadr.com/file-an-eu-us-privacy-shield-or-safe-harbor-claim. If required by law, we will work with the appropriate panel of DPAs or individual DPA in the EU to resolve disputes. Under certain circumstances, these dispute resolution processes may result in your ability to invoke binding arbitration. As a US company, we are also subject to the investigatory and enforcement power of the FTC regarding our compliance with the Privacy Shield Framework and this Policy, and you may direct complaints to the FTC in the event the dispute resolution processes described above is unsatisfactory.
