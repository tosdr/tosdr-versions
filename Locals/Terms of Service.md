Terms of Service
================

Version 1.3.7 Last Revised: July 19, 2024

**TL;DR - These are the rules that govern your use of the Locals community and website, whether you are yourself a creator, or simply a member of a particular creator community, or both. For example, if you're using Locals as a creator, then Section 4 ("Using the Site as a Creator") would apply to you; if you're using Locals as a member within a creator community, then Section 5 ("Using the Site as a Community Member") would apply to you, etc. In addition to these rules, you should check out our "Community Guidelines" as well as our "Privacy Policy" - as both of these will apply to anyone using Locals. Also, if you are a Creator, you should check out our "Data Processing Agreement" which is designed to protect the data privacy of any members in your community.**

Certain features of the Site may be subject to additional guidelines, terms, or rules, which will be posted on the Site in connection with such features. All such additional terms, guidelines, and rules including without limitation our Community Guidelines (available at [https://locals.com/site/community-guidelines](https://locals.com/site/community-guidelines)), our Data Processing Agreement (available at [https://locals.com/site/dpa](https://locals.com/site/dpa)), and our Privacy Policy (available at [https://locals.com/site/privacy](https://locals.com/site/privacy)) are incorporated by reference into these Terms of Use (and collectively may be referred to as the " **Locals Policies**" or simply the " **Terms**").

These Terms set forth the legally binding terms and conditions that govern your use of the Site. By accessing or using the Site, you are accepting BOTH these Terms AND OUR PRIVACY POLICY, AVAILABLE AT [the " POLICY"](https://locals.com/site/privacy) , on behalf of yourself or the entity that you represent, and you represent and warrant that you have the right, authority, and capacity to enter into BOTH these Terms AND THE POLICY (on behalf of yourself or the entity that you represent).

We will never seek to "steal" your User Content or use your User Content in a manner that is inconsistent with your rights in your User Content.

4\. Using the Site as a Creator.
--------------------------------

**4.1. Definitions. You are a " Creator"** if you use the Site to offer paid membership subscriptions to other users of the Site in exchange for membership benefits, which may be facilitated through the Site (each user of the Site paying for such membership subscription, a "**Community Member**"). Said membership benefits may include, without limitation, access to content or information that is exclusive to your Community Members (collectively, "**Creator Content**"), the ability for your Community Members to send and receive messages directly to you and/or between themselves, and/or merchandise or other tangible items that you make available to your Community Members (collectively, "**Benefits**"). If you are using the Site as a Creator, then the provisions of this Section 4 apply to you and shall prevail in the event of any conflict with any other provisions of these Terms.

4.2. Creator Payments, Fees & Refunds. When you offer Benefits as a Creator through the Site, we facilitate payments made by your Community Members to you. Payment processing, including refunds, shall be managed by the payment platform utilized by Company from time to time and may include the use of a third-party payment processing service provider.

### 4.2.1 Payments Made to You.

(A) If Company utilizes Stripe, Inc. for payments made by your Community Members through the Site, you agree that any such payments shall be collected and processed via Stripe, Inc., available at [https://stripe.com](https://stripe.com/) ("Stripe"), and that in order to use the Site as a Creator you must: (a) create your own Stripe account; (b) agree to and abide by all of Stripe's own legal terms and conditions; and (c) cooperate with us in order to properly integrate your Stripe account with the Site, as reasonably directed by us. Payments made by your Community Members will be deposited directly by Company into your Stripe account in a timely manner after deduction of the following fees: (i) certain processing fees which are applied by Stripe, or which are applied by banks and/or other financial institutions not affiliated with us (collectively, "Processing Fees"); (ii) the "Locals Platform Fee" which is 10% of all Subscription Fees received by Creator from their Community Members and, if you do not Opt-Out of Company Issued Refunds (as defined in Section 4.2.2(B) below), Company will also deduct (x) five percent (5%) of gross revenues as a reserve for refunds, and (y) will deduct any applicable refunds. Company reserves the right to change the Locals Platform Fee at any time.

(B) If payment processing is managed by Company without the use of third-party provider Stripe, you agree that payments shall be directly deposited to you by Company utilizing an automated clearing house (“ACH”) or wire transfer. You will be notified if this form of payment processing is selected by Company, at which time Company will request ACH or wire transfer information from you. Payments due to you will be calculated by Company at the end of each month and will include deductions for (i) the Locals Platform Fee (as defined in Section 4.2.1(A)(ii) above), (ii) any applicable Processing Fees (as defined in Section 4.2.1(A)(i) above), and, if you do not Opt-Out of Company Issued Refunds (as defined in Section 4.2.2(B) below), Company will also deduct (x) five percent (5%) of gross revenues as a reserve for refunds, and (y) will deduct any applicable refunds. Payments will be made to you in a timely manner.

You can review all Processing Fees and the applicable Locals Platform Fee within the 'settings' section of your Account. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, we may hold or block certain payments in the event that these Terms (including any of our additional terms, guidelines, and rules) have been violated, for legal or tax compliance reasons (including if we suspect any fraudulent activity), or as otherwise required by Stripe, any other third-party service provider, or any applicable legal or regulatory authority. Please contact Locals for more details.

**4.2.2 Refunds (other than for Locals Coins).** The Company’s default position is that it will issue a refund on your behalf for any reason when requested by a Community Member and Company will manage the refund process. You have the option to Opt-Out of Company Issued Refunds, as described in more detail in sub-section (B) below.

(A) If Company manages the refund process, the Company will issue the refund on your behalf. If Company chooses to manage the refund process using Stripe, you hereby authorize Company to issue the refund via your Stripe account. For the avoidance of doubt, if you do not Opt-Out of Company Issued Refunds, the deductions specified in Section 4.2.1(A)(x) and (y) and Section 4.2.1(B)(x) and (y) will be made by Company to any payments deposited to you in addition to deductions for the Locals Platform Fee and Processing Fees. (B) If you do not want Company to manage or issue refunds on your behalf, you must notify Company in writing that you Opt-Out of Company Issued Refunds, in which case you will manage and issue all refunds, if any, using your Stripe account. If you Opt-Out of Company Issued Refunds, the deductions specified in Section 4.2.1(A)(x) and (y) and Section 4.2.1(B)(x) and (y) will not be made by Company to any payments deposited to you, but only deductions for the Locals Platform Fee and Processing Fees will be made.

**4.2.3 Refunds (for Locals Coins).** Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, including Section 4.2.2 above, but in any case, subject to Section 5.7(B) and (C) below, Company always maintains the right to make refunds for Locals Coins. Even if Creator opts out of having Company issue refunds pursuant to Section 4.2.2(B) above, Creator will not have the ability to issue Locals Coins refunds.

**4.3. Taxes.** We do not manage, account for, or make any tax withholdings in connection with applicable federal, provincial, state, local or other governmental sales, goods and services, harmonized or other taxes, fees, or charges, whether now in force or enacted in the future (collectively, "Taxes"), except that we may collect your tax identification information and report such information to the relevant tax authorities to the extent we are legally required to do so. To the maximum extent permitted by law (unless explicitly stated otherwise), all Processing Fees and the Locals Platform Fee are exclusive of any Taxes. You are responsible for payment of all Taxes relating to your use of the Site as a Creator. If we are obligated to pay or collect any Taxes that you have paid or will pay based on your use of the Site as a Creator, you agree that you are ultimately responsible for such Taxes and that we may collect the payment amount for such Taxes from you.

**4.4. Other Restrictions.** You may not use the Site or offer any Benefits which in any manner violate these Terms, including all of our additional terms, guidelines, and rules. Please read our Community Guidelines carefully, which are available at [https://locals.com/site/community-guidelines](https://locals.com/site/community-guidelines), and our Data Processing Agreement which is available at [https://locals.com/site/dpa](https://locals.com/site/dpa). You are responsible for keeping the data and information of your Community Members secure and you acknowledge and agree that no person under the age of 17 is permitted to use the Site.

### 4.5. Data ownership and Protection.

Company may share relevant Community Member Data with Creator, as outlined in Company's Data Processing Agreement, and Creator may collect Community Member Data, in both cases, solely for the purpose of enabling Creator to provide Benefits to its Community Members.

Company and Creator acknowledge and agree that Creator’s provision of Benefits to Community Members may extend outside of the Services provided by Company and may continue after Creator has ceased to use Company's Services. For the avoidance of doubt, if Creator offers Benefits to Community Members, including offering merchandise, Creator is solely responsible for any such Benefits and releases Company from any and all responsibility, liability, claims, costs, or expenses associated therewith.

Further, Creator is responsible for following all applicable data privacy laws with respect to the Community Member Data shared with Creator or collected by Creator, including complying with any data erasure requests from Community Members or Company. Creator agrees to indemnify, release, and hold Company and its affiliate companies harmless from any claims that Community Member Data has been handled in violation of any such laws. Creator further agrees that it shall continue to abide by any applicable data privacy laws following the expiration or termination of the Locals Policies and/or this Agreement as they apply to Community Members.

Creator will not be required to delete or return to Company any Community Member Data in Creator’s possession following the expiration or termination of the Locals Policies and/or this Agreement as they apply to Creator unless such deletion or return is required by applicable data privacy laws.

Company shall immediately inform Creator in writing if it becomes aware of a circumstance that would require the deletion or return of any Community Member Data.

### 4.6 Community Moderation by Creator

Creators in their sole determination may remove or modify any User Content, and/or request that Locals remove Community Members from their community.

### 4.7 Closing a Community

In the event a Creator wishes to close their Community, Locals reserves the right to: (i) Inform all Community Members and supporters that the Community is closing; (ii) Post and/or provide to the Community Members the Creator's email address; and (iii) Cancel all subscriptions and issue pro rata refunds to all Community Members.

### 4.8 Changing of Fees or Additional Charges to Community Members using External Tools

In the event a Creator changes prices or creates additional charges to Community Members using external tools outside of the Locals environment, Locals reserves the right to cancel subscriptions and issue pro rata refunds to affected Community Members and to close the Community.

### 4.9 The Affiliate Program

The Affiliate Program allows Creators to designate a third party as an "Affiliate" who may refer customers to Creator's Community. In addition to any other applicable terms and conditions contained in these Terms, the following terms and conditions apply specifically to the Affiliate Program:

* If a Creator wishes to participate in the Affiliate Program, they will opt in via their dashboard and create Affiliate links.
* The Creator may select one or more Affiliates of their choice.
* The Creator will give each Affiliate a unique link or promo code that will be shared by the Affiliate with customers who wish to sign up for a monthly or annual Paid Membership to Creator's Community.
* The Creator will designate the amount payable to an Affiliate (the "Affiliate Amount") for each Paid Membership brought to the Creator by the Affiliate, not to exceed fifty percent (50%) of the amount paid to the Creator for any such Paid Membership.
* The Creator will designate the number of payments an Affiliate will be paid with respect to any Paid Membership.
* The Affiliate must have a Stripe account in order to receive payment.
* For any Paid Membership generated by an Affiliate, the Company will deduct one hundred percent (100%) of the Paid Membership amount from the Creator's Stripe or other designated account and hold such funds until the end of the calendar month during which the Affiliate Amount was earned.
* No later than thirty (30) days after the end of the calendar month during which the Affiliate Amount was earned, the Company will:

* Pay to the Affiliate's Stripe account any Affiliate Amount due; and
* Pay to the Creator's Stripe or other designated account the amounts due to the Creator.

* If a refund is issued to a Community Member for a Paid Membership prior to the Affiliate Amount being paid, the Affiliate Amount will not be paid. If a refund is issued to a Community Member for a Paid Membership after the Affiliate Amount has been paid, the Company will deduct the Affiliate Amount refund from the Creator's Stripe or other designated account.
* The Company may discontinue this Affiliate Program at any time. The Company may also require a Creator to discontinue using a particular Affiliate at the Company’s sole discretion.

5\. Using the Site as a Community Member.
-----------------------------------------

**5.1. Paid Membership Subscriptions.** The Site allows you to receive certain Benefits from specific Creators in exchange for becoming a Community Member of that Creator through paid membership subscriptions offered by the Creator, (each, a " **Paid Membership**"). By signing up for a Paid Membership, you agree to pay the specified subscription fees (collectively, "**Subscription Fees**") associated with such Paid Membership as indicated on the Site.

Such Subscription Fees may be collected and processed via Stripe ([https://stripe.com](https://stripe.com/)) and/or PayPal ([https://www.paypal.com](https://www.paypal.com/)) (collectively, our " **Billing Service Providers**"), which have their own legal terms. You will be required to provide us and/or our Billing Service Provider with information regarding your credit card or other payment method. You represent and warrant that such information is true and that you are authorized to use the payment method. Depending on the Paid Membership, there may be a one-time fee or recurring Subscription Fees. For recurring Subscription Fees, we will bill or charge you in regular automatically-renewing intervals (such as monthly, annually, or biennially), on a pre-pay basis until you cancel, which you can do at any time either through the Site or by contacting the relevant support team.

Subscription Fees may also be paid for using Locals Coins at the rates set by Locals at the time of initial subscription and subscription renewal.

Please also review our policy for in app purchases in Section 12 (" **Mobile Applications**") below. In the event of any conflict between this Section 5.1 and Section 12, then Section 12 will prevail. You acknowledge and agree that in certain situations you may lose access to the Benefits offered by a Creator, including without limitation in the case you cancel your Paid Membership, your payment method(s) fail, a Creator decides to block your Account, or a Creator decides to delete his or her own Account on the Site.

5.2. Taxes. To the extent permitted by law, or unless explicitly stated otherwise, all Subscription Fees are exclusive of applicable Taxes (defined above). You are responsible for payment of all applicable Taxes relating to your use of the Site, your payments, or your purchases. If we are obligated to pay or collect Taxes on the Subscription Fees you've paid or will pay, you are responsible for such Taxes, and we may collect payment for such Taxes; for example, if you are located in the EU we may add VAT to the total charges for Subscriptions Fees.

5.3. Payment Failures. If your payment fails or if a Paid Membership is otherwise not paid for or paid for on time, the Creator may cancel or revoke your access to the Paid Membership through the Site. If you contact your bank or credit card company to decline or reverse the charge of Subscription Fees for a Paid Membership, we may revoke your access to the Site in general.

5.4. Automatic Renewal. To ensure uninterrupted service, payments for any recurring Paid Memberships are automatically renewed. This means that unless you cancel a Paid Membership before the end of the applicable subscription period, it will automatically renew, and you authorize us to invoice you or use any payment mechanism we have on record for you to collect the then-applicable Subscription Fees (as well as any Taxes). By default, your Paid Memberships will be renewed for the same interval of time as your original subscription period. For example, if you purchase a one month subscription, you will be charged for each monthly subscription period thereafter. We may charge your account up to one month before the end of the subscription period. It is your responsibility to make sure you are checking your email (including any spam or other filters) in order to receive any reminder email we send to you in advance of renewal. The date for the automatic renewal may be determined automatically based on the date of the original purchase and in such event cannot be changed.

5.5. Canceling Automatic Renewal. You can manage and cancel your subscription for any Paid Membership either through the Site (under 'manage subscription' within 'settings') or by contacting the relevant support team.

5.6. Fee Changes. Creators may change their Subscription Fees at any time, or start charging Subscription Fees for Benefits that were previously free. When applicable, Creators may give you advance notice of the Subscription Fee changes. If you don't agree with the Subscription Fee changes, you must cancel your subscription to the Paid Membership or you will be charged in accordance with the new Subscription Fees.

### 5.7. Refunds.

(A) While you may cancel your Paid Memberships at any time, refunds are issued pursuant to Section 4.2.2 and 4.2.3 above, unless otherwise required by applicable law. For the avoidance of doubt, if a Creator does not Opt-Out of Company Issued Refunds, refunds will be issued by the Company. If a Creator does Opt-Out of Company Issued Refunds, refunds will be issued in the Creator’s sole discretion.

(B) Refunds for Coins purchases from the Locals website are issued by Company, unless otherwise required by applicable law.

(C) Refunds for Coins purchases from the Locals App are subject to the terms contained in Section 12 below.

### 5.8. Content Plus.

When you purchase Content Plus (as defined in Section 13 below) you will have access to the Content Plus post as long as you have a Locals account and the Creator of the Content Plus continues to make their content available through Locals.

6\. Indemnification.
--------------------

You agree to indemnify and hold Company (and its officers, employees, and agents) harmless, including costs and attorneys' fees, from any claim or demand made by any third party due to or arising out of (a) your use of the Site, (b) your violation of these Terms, (c) your violation of applicable laws or regulations or (d) your User Content. Company reserves the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify us, and you agree to cooperate with our defense of these claims. You agree not to settle any matter without the prior written consent of Company. Company will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such claim, action or proceeding upon becoming aware of it.

7\. Third-Party Links & Ads; Other Users
----------------------------------------

**7.1. Third-Party Links & Ads.** The Site may contain links to third-party websites and services, and/or display advertisements for third parties (collectively, " **Third-Party Links & Ads**"). Such Third-Party Links & Ads are not under the control of Company, and Company is not responsible for any Third-Party Links & Ads. Company provides access to these Third-Party Links & Ads only as a convenience to you, and does not review, approve, monitor, endorse, warrant, or make any representations with respect to Third-Party Links & Ads. You use all Third-Party Links & Ads at your own risk, and should apply a suitable level of caution and discretion in doing so. When you click on any of the Third-Party Links & Ads, the applicable third party's terms and policies apply, including the third party's privacy and data gathering practices. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any transaction in connection with such Third-Party Links & Ads.

**7.2. Other Users.** Each Site user is solely responsible for any and all of its own User Content. Because we do not control User Content, including without limitation any Benefits offered by Creators through any Paid Memberships, you acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for any User Content, Benefits, or Paid Memberships, whether provided by you or by others. We make no guarantees regarding the accuracy, currency, suitability, or quality of any User Content, Benefits, or Paid Memberships. Your interactions with other Site users, whether Creators or Community Members, are solely between you and such users. You agree that Company will not be responsible for any loss or damage incurred as the result of any such interactions. If there is a dispute between you and any Site user, whether a Creator or a Community Member, we are under no obligation to become involved.

**7.3. Release.** You hereby release and forever discharge the Company (and our officers, employees, agents, successors, and assigns) from, and hereby waive and relinquish, each and every past, present and future dispute, claim, controversy, demand, right, obligation, liability, action and cause of action of every kind and nature (including personal injuries, death, and property damage), that has arisen or arises directly or indirectly out of, or that relates directly or indirectly to, the Site (including any interactions with, or act or omission of, other Site users or any Third-Party Links & Ads). IF YOU ARE A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT, YOU HEREBY WAIVE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542 IN CONNECTION WITH THE FOREGOING, WHICH STATES: "A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR."

------------

Changes.** These Terms are subject to occasional revision, and if we make any substantial changes, we may notify you by sending you an e-mail to the last e-mail address you provided to us (if any), and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on our Site. You are responsible for providing us with your most current e-mail address. In the event that the last e-mail address that you have provided us is not valid, or for any reason is not capable of delivering to you the notice described above, our dispatch of the e-mail containing such notice will nonetheless constitute effective notice of the changes described in the notice. Any changes to these Terms will be effective upon the earlier of thirty (30) calendar days following our dispatch of an e-mail notice to you (if applicable) or thirty (30) calendar days following our posting of notice of the changes on our Site. These changes will be effective immediately for new users of our Site. Continued use of our Site following notice of such changes shall indicate your acknowledgement of such changes and agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of such changes.

**14.2. Claims.** You may not bring a claim against the Company for suspending or terminating a Creator or Member account, and you agree you will not bring such a claim. If you try to bring such a claim, you are responsible for the damages caused, including attorneys fees and costs. These terms remain in effect even if you no longer have a Creator or Member account.

**14.3. Dispute Resolution. Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It is part of your contract with Company and affects your rights. It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.**

**(a) Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.** All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with the Terms or the use of any product or service provided by the Company that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and the Company, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.

**(b) Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution.** Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute ( "**Notice**" ) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to the Company should be sent to: 444 Gulf of Mexico Dr, Longboat Key, FL 34228. After the Notice is received, you and the Company may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and the Company do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.

**(c) Arbitration Rules.** Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association ( "**AAA**" ), an established alternative dispute resolution provider ( "**ADR Provider**" ) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration, including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules ( "**Arbitration Rules**" ) governing the arbitration are available online at [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/) or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last settlement offer that the Company made to you prior to the initiation of arbitration, the Company will pay you the greater of the award or $2,500.00. Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorney's fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.

**(d) Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration.** If non-appearance based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.

**(e) Time Limits.** If you or the Company pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.

**(f) Authority of Arbitrator.** If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and the Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and the Company.

**(g) Waiver of Jury Trial.** THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and the Company in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.

**(h) Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.** ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CREATOR OR MEMBER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CREATOR OR MEMBER.

**(i) Confidentiality.** All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law. This paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.

**(j) Miscellaneous.** If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted. Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or the Company may bring an individual action in small claims court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party's patent, copyright, trademark or trade secrets shall not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement. In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Sarasota County, Florida, for such purpose, and waive any jurisdictional, venue, or inconvenient forum objections thereto.
