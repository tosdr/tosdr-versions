6 How we use your Personal Information
--------------------------------------

**6.1 Content of Email**

We will not read or disclose to any third party any private email communication information that is transmitted using our products and services, unless given appropriate explicit consent to do so.

**6.2 Log**

We have provided logging functions for emails and other communications transmitted in the process of using our products and services. Any user can select to turn his own log record function on or off. We will not read or disclose to any third party any users’ private information it records as part of the logging functions without further consent.

**6.3 UID information**

When you use our products and services and activate/register them, our system will generate a user ID (UID) for you at random, by which we identify the user and provide the services. We may collect your phone number and associate it with UID and/or any of our other internal tracking tools or service account, such as Account to complete the billing process and provide certain service such as anti-lost remote control.

We respect the request of any user or third party to verify his own UID information, and will correct or allow the correction of any possibly incorrect information. Any user and third party can ascertain whether his information has been appropriately corrected by either email or phone at any time.

**6.4 Caller ID & Call Block Function**

When you use the Caller ID and Call Block function, we will collect, process and retain personal information from you and any devices you may use in your interaction with our Services. This information may include the following: geo-location, your IP address, device ID or unique identifier, device manufacturer and type, device and hardware settings, ID for advertising, ads data, operating system, operator, IMSI, connection information, usage statistics, device log and event information, the number of incoming & outgoing calls and other information based on your interaction with our Services.

Please note: the app will never store your contacts and your call history. The app accesses the contacts on the phone in order to display the contacts and so the app can record or ignore calls from specific contacts. While we are intensity focused on protecting you from unknown calls, we are just as concerned with making sure important calls are not missed. Access to contacts helps us filter out numbers that may look spam, but are actually legitimate (like your Doctor’s office). We also access contacts to identity callers under the name you prefer to see, to enable your ability to add numbers to your blocklist.

You can tag an unknown number after making a call. So this contribution will make our database better. We may also associate a name with a phone number through the numbers tagging functionality, which allows a user who receives a call from a phone number which is not associated with a name in the database to indicate a name to be associated with that number. A name will only be associated with a number through this functionality if a sufficient number of independent Users, based on our algorithm, have indicated the same name for the relevant number.

Call Blocking requires accessing your contacts. Therefore, the app is able to block the numbers that users refuse to answer. Meanwhile, the app can also block numbers from user’s contacts.
