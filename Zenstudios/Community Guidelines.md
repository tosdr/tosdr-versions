ZEN Studios Software Developer Limited Liability Company including its affiliates (**“ZEN”**), in connection with and in order to provide and develop ZEN’s products, mobile applications, services and websites (together **“ZEN Services”**) outlines in this code of conduct (**“Code of Conduct”**) the rules that you need to follow to help ensure that ZEN Services are fun for everyone.

**A. USING ZEN SERVICES**

What you can and should do:

* Be polite and treat others with respect. Just because you’re online doesn’t mean you should be a jerk.
* Make friends. If you find players you enjoy gaming with, put them on your preferred gamers list.
* Be good at a game. You will NEVER be suspended because you are too good.
* Have fun!

**B. HARASSMENT**

* Do not harass, abuse, bully, spam, scream at, threaten or stalk other users or encourage other players to do so.
* Do not encourage harm or violence against people or animals, or promote self-harm in any manner.
* Do not give out personal information of other users (such as real name, physical address, IP address, email address, phone number, credit card number, etc.) in any way. This information could be used by others for illegal or harmful purposes.
* Any non-game-related conversation that takes up a substantial amount of the forum, chat, or in-game chat space and prevents users from finding game-related information may be considered a violation of this Code of Conduct.
