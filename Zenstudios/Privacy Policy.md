**Use of Google Adwords conversion tracking**

The controller uses the online ad programme called “Google Adwords”, and within its framework it uses Google’s conversion tracking service. Google conversion tracking is the analysing service of Google Inc. (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA; „Google“).

When a User reaches a website via a Google ad, a cookie necessary for conversion tracking is stored on his or her computer. The validity of these cookies is limited; therefore, they do not contain any personal data, and Users cannot be identified by them.

When the User browses on certain pages of the website, and the cookie has not expired, Google and the data controller may see that the User has clicked on the ad.

All Google AdWords clients receive different cookies; therefore, they cannot be tracked via the websites of the clients of AdWords.

Information which have been obtained with the use of conversion tracking cookies aim to prepare conversion statistics for the clients of AdWords who opt for conversion tracking. This is how clients receive information on the number of users clicking on their ad and directed to the website having a conversion tracking label. However, they cannot receive information based on which any of the users may be identified.

If you do not wish to participate in conversion tracking, then you may refuse it by blocking the option to install cookies in your browser. After this, you will not figure in statistics related to conversion tracking.

Instead of deletion, the Service Provider shall block personal data if User requests so, or if the violation of User’s legitimate interests by deletion is reasonable assumable from the available information. The blocked personal data may only be processed as long as the aim of data processing that prevented the deleting of the personal data exists.

The Service Provider shall erase the personal data if processing it is unlawful, if it is requested to do so by the User, if the data processed is deficient or erroneous—and it cannot be rectified lawfully—provided that erasure is not prohibited by law, the purpose of the processing no longer exists, the deadline for storing the data set forth in the law has expired or it is ordered by court or by the National Authority for Data Protection and Freedom of Information.

As soon as possible after filing the request but not later than within 1 (one) month thereafter, the Service Provider shall investigate the objection, shall make a decision about the justification thereof, and inform the applicant about the decision in writing. If, according to the findings of the Service Provider, the data subject’s objection is justified, the controller shall terminate all processing operations (including data collection and transmission), block the data involved and notify all recipients to whom any of these data had previously been transferred concerning the objection and the ensuing measures, upon which these recipients shall also take measures regarding the enforcement of the objection.

**Judicial remedy**

The burden of proof to show compliance with the law lies with the data controller. The lawfulness of data transfer shall be certified by the data receiving party. The regional courts shall have the competence to decide in such cases. The court case may be initiated before the court having jurisdiction either at the place of the temporary or the permanent residence of the data subject. Any person otherwise lacking legal capacity to be a party to legal proceedings may also be involved in such actions. The Authority may intervene in the action on the data subject’s behalf.

When the court’s decision is in favour of the plaintiff, the court shall order the controller to provide the information, to rectify, block or erase the data in question, to annul the decision adopted by means of automated data-processing systems, to respect the data subject’s objection, or to disclose the data requested by the data recipient.

If the court rejects the petition filed by the data recipient, the controller shall be required to erase the data subject’s personal data within 3 days of delivery of the court ruling. The controller shall erase the data even if the data recipient does not file for court action within a determined time limit.

The court may order publication of its decision, indicating the identification data of the controller as well, where this is deemed necessary for reasons of data protection or in connection with the rights of large numbers of data subjects under protection.

The data controller shall be liable for damages caused by the data processor and s/he will be liable to pay restitution for personal rights violations as well. The controller shall be released from liability for damages and from paying restitution if s/he demonstrates that the damage or the violation of personal rights were brought about by reasons beyond his/her data processing activity.

No compensation shall be paid, and no restitution may be demanded where the damage or the violation of rights was caused by intentional or seriously negligent conduct on the part of the aggrieved party or the data subject.

**_Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights_**

To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:

E-mailing us at: support@zenstudios.com

Calling us at: +36 1 780 4679

Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.

You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:

* Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.
* Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.

**_Response Timing and Format_**

We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt.  If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt.  The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded.  If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

**_Non-Discrimination_**

We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:

* Deny you goods or services.
* Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
* Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.
* Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
