Unless a dispute would be governed by the terms of Section 21 below, you agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the city of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, United States. **For EU users only:** In the event of a dispute relating to the interpretation, performance, or validity of this Agreement, an amicable solution can be sought before any legal action. You can file your complaint with Zen Studios by sending a message via email to [info@zenstudios.com](mailto:info@zenstudios.com). In case of failure, you can, within one year of the failed request, have recourse to an Alternative Dispute Resolution procedure by filing an online complaint on the European Commission’s Online Dispute Resolution website: [https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/odr/main/index.cfm?event=main.home.chooseLanguage](https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/odr/main/index.cfm?event=main.home.chooseLanguage). In the event that out-of-court dispute resolutions fail, the dispute may be brought before the competent courts.

21. **Binding Arbitration**

  
Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of the Service (each, a “Claim”) will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court (except that you may assert claims in small-claims court if your claims qualify). You agree that each Claim must be brought individually.  
YOU AND ZEN STUDIOS AGREE THAT (i) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS ACTION BASIS OR TO UTILIZE CLASS ACTION PROCEDURES; (ii) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL; AND (iii) NO ARBITRATION MAY BE JOINED WITH ANY OTHER ARBITRATION.  
The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this Agreement and this binding arbitration clause.  
Arbitration is a process with no judge or jury – an arbitrator will review the arguments in the dispute and award damages and other relief just like a court would. The arbitrator must follow this Agreement as a court otherwise would. Court review of the arbitration award is limited under the Federal Arbitration Act.  
To start an arbitration, you must send an email to [info@zenstudios.com](mailto:info@zenstudios.com) describing your Claim and requesting arbitration, or we may do the same by sending a written notice requesting arbitration to your address. The proceedings will be conducted through JAMS, using their Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures. You can view these rules at jamsadr.com or by calling 800-352-5267. The payment of the initial filing fees will be made by the party filing the Claim, and any other filing and other fees will be apportioned as directed by the JAMS rules. The arbitration will take place in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, United States, unless the Parties agree to video, phone, or internet connection appearances.  
Except as otherwise set forth below, you may seek any remedies available to you under federal, state or local laws in an arbitration action. As part of the arbitration, both you and Zen Studios will have the opportunity for discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the Claim. The arbitrator will provide a written statement of the arbitrator’s decision regarding the Claim, the award given (including any attorneys’ fees and costs awarded), and the arbitrator’s findings and conclusions on which the arbitrator’s decision is based.  
Notwithstanding the terms of this Section, either of us may bring a lawsuit in court for equitable relief, for any misuse or infringement of intellectual property rights, or for any Claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use of the Service.  
BY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND ZEN STUDIOS WAIVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.  
You and Zen Studios agree that if any portion this Section is found illegal or unenforceable, that portion will be severed and the remainder of the Section will be given full force and effect.

22. **Miscellaneous Terms**
    1. **Agreement Revisions.** This Agreement may only be revised in writing by Zen Studios, or by Zen Studios’ publication of a new version on the Service.

    3. **Embargo.** You represent and warrant that you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country and that you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties

    8. **No Waiver.** Our failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will in no way be construed to be a present or future waiver of such provision, nor in any way affect the right of any party to enforce every such provision thereafter. The express waiver by us of any provision, condition or requirement of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of any future obligation to comply with such provision, condition or requirement. 
    9. **Equitable Remedies.** You hereby agree that Zen Studios would be irreparably damaged if the terms of this Agreement were not specifically enforced, and therefore you agree that we will be entitled, without bond, other security, or proof of damages, to appropriate equitable remedies with respect to breaches of this Agreement, in addition to such other remedies as we may otherwise have available to us under applicable laws. Additionally, you agree that your sole remedy, if any, for any breach of this Agreement will be solely in money damages. You hereby waive and relinquish any right you may otherwise have to obtain injunctive or equitable relief under this Agreement.
