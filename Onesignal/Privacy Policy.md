**Introduction and Background [](#introduction-and-background "Direct link to Introduction and Background ")** 

OneSignal, Inc. is a U.S. company located at 201 S. B Street, San Mateo, CA 94401 (“OneSignal” “we,” “us,” and “our”). 

OneSignal is a customer engagement platform for companies around the world to enable their relationships with (and communicate with) their customers. This is primarily done by leveraging first party data (the company’s data on their customers) to personalize and automate messaging by the company through various channels, such as email, SMS, mobile push notifications, web push notifications, and in-app messaging. 

OneSignal collects this first party data through a software development kit (“ **SDKs [](#sDKs "Direct link to SDKs")** ”) that companies use in their mobile applications and websites. These web and mobile SDKs permit app developers and website operators to send, manage, optimize and customize messages to their customers and users. All of our services are referred to collectively as our “ **Services, [](#services "Direct link to Services,")** ” and the app developers, website operators, business customers, partners and advertisers are referred to collectively as our “ **Clients. [](#clients "Direct link to Clients.")** ” 

This privacy policy (the “ **Privacy Policy [](#privacy-policy "Direct link to Privacy Policy")** ”) explains our personal information practices regarding:  

* Our Client’s end users and customers (“**Client End Users**”), 
* Our Clients’, partners’, and vendors’ business representatives (e.g., their employees), and 
* Users of our website(s), including any website on which this Privacy Policy is posted, which we separately describe in Section 4,  [below](https://onesignal.com/privacy_policy#section4) . 

This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party sites or hosted services you may find or access through our website. This Privacy Policy also does not apply to our Client’s data practices.  If you submit personal information to any of those sites or services or to our Clients, your information will be governed by their privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any site you visit or hosted service you use.

**Data Controller or Data Processor  [](#data-controller-or-data-processor "Direct link to Data Controller or Data Processor ")**  

OneSignal is primarily a data processor (or service provider) in relation to the Services we provide to our Clients, such as when a Client deploys our technology in order to collect, process or transfer their first party data. In some cases we operate as a data controller (or business) when we process personal information of our business contacts, employees, and representatives.  

**1\. Changes to This Privacy Policy [](#1-changes-to-this-privacy-policy "Direct link to 1. Changes to This Privacy Policy ")** 

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify this Privacy Policy or any portion thereof. Any changes will be effective from the time of publication of the new privacy policy. Your continued use of the Services after the changes have been implemented shall indicate your agreement with the terms of such revised privacy policy.

Where applicable and required by law, we may enter into U.S. business associate agreements with our Clients for the processing of protected health information. We refer to all of the above collectively as the “ SDK Information .”Sources of SDK Information ")** 

The categories of sources of the SDK Information include the following:  

* Information provided by our Clients
* Information automatically collected from our Clients’ use of the Services 

**How We Use the SDK Information [](#how-we-use-the-sdk-information "Direct link to How We Use the SDK Information ")** 

We use the SDK Information on behalf of our Clients for the purpose of providing the Services to our Clients. This includes: 

* To offer and support app and website features provided through the SDKs, including those related to push notifications. This includes, for instance, providing customer, technical and operational support for these features, detecting and protecting against errors, fraud, or other criminal activity; resolving disputes and enforcing our legal terms and other rights we may have. It also includes analyzing, customizing, and improving the features we offer Clients. 
* To provide information and analytics to our Clients about the use of these app and website features provided through the SDKs, or to help Clients create or enhance user profiles of Client End Users. 
* To enable Clients to create inferences about Client End Users. For instance, if SDK Information indicates that a particular device is frequently seen at restaurants, we might categorize a user for targeting of local restaurant offers. Or, if a user is frequently seen at sports stadiums, we might categorize the user as a “Sports Fan.” 
* To develop and use “predictive models” which are data models that try to predict Client End Users’ potential future behavior and interests on a per-device basis or across devices. 
* To analyze ad performance, for instance, by attributing Client End Users’ app installations, web visits, or store visits to ad campaigns. 
* Sometimes, the SDK Information may be used to resolve identities across multiple devices, such as to match IP addresses or hashed emails to link a Client End User across (for instance) browsers, mobile devices, tablets, set top boxes, or other devices. 
* Sometimes the SDK Information may be used to perform any of the above functions, or other marketing or analytics services. Or, we may aggregate and create data “models” to do this – creating algorithms in order to predict certain trends and things that different Client End Users might have in common. 

We may deploy online cookies to track users across websites, or to associate users (and these cookies) with Mobile IDs. We may do this to resolve user identifies across platforms, and to better or more accurately target messages. You can learn more about cookies and similar technologies, such as web beacons and SDKs, in the Section titled “ **Cookies, Pixel Tags and [](#cookies-pixel-tags-and "Direct link to Cookies, Pixel Tags and")** [**SDKs**](https://onesignal.com/privacy_policy#section5) **[](#sDKs "Direct link to SDKs")**.” 

We may also use the SDK Information for the following purposes:

* To explore a potential acquisition or sale of our business
* To prevent or stop activity that we may think is illegal; to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, and that of you and others; to protect the security of our services or website; to comply with applicable law; to comply with legal process and our legal obligations; to respond to requests or requirements from public, law and government authorities and private parties; to enforce our terms; to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit potential damages; and to exercise or defend legal claims 
* In other ways with your consent or at your direction

**How We Disclose the SDK Information [](#how-we-disclose-the-sdk-information "Direct link to How We Disclose the SDK Information ")** 

We may disclose SDK Information to the following categories of third parties: 

* **Service Providers. [](#service-providers "Direct link to Service Providers.")** We disclose the SDK Information on our Clients’ behalf to service providers, contractors and other companies to fulfill your orders, operate our business, communicate with you and make available our Services and this Website. These service providers may help us perform any of the activities set forth in Section 2.

* We likewise may disclose the SDK Information or data segments regarding a Client (for instance, related to push notifications they send) for that Client’s own advertising, analytics, or other purposes. 
* **Affiliates. [](#affiliates "Direct link to Affiliates.")** We may disclose your information to our affiliates (e.g., our subsidiaries). 
* **Buyers and investors. [](#buyers-and-investors "Direct link to Buyers and investors.")** We may disclose or transfer your personal information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any acquisition of our business, financing or similar transaction. 
* **Other third parties for legal purposes. [](#other-third-parties-for-legal-purposes "Direct link to Other third parties for legal purposes.")** We may also disclose your information if we believe it is required: (a) to prevent or stop activity that we may think is, or is at risk of being, illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity; (b) to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, and that of you and others; (c) to protect our operations and the security of our services and website; (d) under applicable law; (e) to comply with legal process and our legal obligations; (f) to respond to requests or requirements from public, law and government authorities (including national security and law enforcement requirements) and private parties; (g) to enforce our terms and conditions; (h) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit potential damages; and (i) to exercise or defend legal claims. 
* **Other ways with consent. [](#other-ways-with-consent "Direct link to Other ways with consent.")** We may disclose your personal information in other ways with your consent or at your direction. 

**California, Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, and Utah Residents.**

We collect the following personal information from visitors of our website(s) (the “ **OneSignal Website Information, [](#oneSignal-website-information "Direct link to OneSignal Website Information,")** ” including the website on which this Privacy Policy appears (“ **OneSignal Website(s) [](#oneSignal-website "Direct link to OneSignal Website(s)")** ”):

* Identifiers that you disclose to us on the OneSignal Websites, such as name, email address, phone number, and other contact information. For example, you provide your personal information when you request information from us, fill out a form on our website, or interact with us in other ways.  

* Internet or other electronic network activity information that is collected by automated mechanisms (e.g., with cookies, unique IDs, pixels and other locally stored objects), such as visitor interactions with the OneSignal Websites. (You can learn more about these technologies below in the Section titled “**Cookies, Pixel Tags and  [](#cookies-pixel-tags-and "Direct link to Cookies, Pixel Tags and ")**  [**SDKs**](https://onesignal.com/privacy_policy#section5) **[](#sDKs "Direct link to SDKs")**”). We may use third party-services such as Google Analytics, in which case those third parties gather information such as your IP address, browser type, the webpage from which you came to our website, and the times of your access to the OneSignal Website. In addition, as you browse our website, advertising cookies may be placed on your computer so that we can understand what you are interested in. Our display advertising partners may then help us retarget ads to you on other sites based on your interactions with the OneSignal Website. To “opt out” of having your information used to tailor ads to you in this way by third party ad platforms that we may work with or provide data to, please review the Section below titled “**Consumer Control and Opt Out  Options**”  to learn how to opt-out of these services and instead receive generic, non-tailored ads. When we do use these types of third party advertising partners, we endeavor to limit and restrict their processing to acting solely as our service provider and data processor. 
* Audio and electronic information of our Clients’, partners’, and vendor’s employees and other representatives in connection with business calls and business email communications. 

* Professional or employment related information about our Clients’, partners’, and vendors’ employees and other representatives.

**Cookies and Pixel Tags. [](#cookies-and-pixel-tags "Direct link to Cookies and Pixel Tags.")**  Cookies are small data files containing a string of characters, such as an anonymous unique browser identifier. Cookies are stored on your computer or other device and act as unique tags that identify your device or browser. Our servers may send your device a cookie when you visit the OneSignal Websites, and our Clients and partners may do likewise on our OneSignal Websites, our Clients’ websites, and elsewhere. A pixel tag (also commonly known as a web beacon or clear GIF) is an invisible 1 x 1 pixel that is placed on certain web pages. When you access web pages on which a pixel tag is deployed, the pixel tag may generate a generic notice of the visit and permit OneSignal, our Clients or partners to set or read cookies. Pixel tags are used in combination with cookies to anonymously track the activity on a website by a particular browser on a particular device. If you disable cookies, pixel tags simply detect an anonymous website visit. OneSignal, alone or with our Clients and partners, may use cookies to, among other things, “remember” you (e.g., when you visit the OneSignal Websites or the websites of our Clients or partners), track trends, and collect information about how you use our Clients’ or partners’ websites or interact with advertising. We and partners we work with use cookies to provide relevant content to you and replace non-relevant ads with ads that better match your interests. We may sometimes use other locally stored objects in ways similar to how we use cookies. Often, these objects are deleted when you clear your browser cookie cache, but because this may not always occur (depending on the browser you use), we recommend that if you wish to opt out of notification features or third party interest-based advertising you instead follow the steps we have set forth in Section 7 titled “ **Consumer Control & Opt-Out Options. [](#consumer-control-opt-out-options "Direct link to Consumer Control &amp; Opt-Out Options.")** ” 

**Mobile Device Identifiers and SDKs. [](#mobile-device-identifiers-and-sDKs "Direct link to Mobile Device Identifiers and SDKs.")**   We may use or work with partners who use mobile SDKs (including our own SDKs, which are described in more detail in this Policy) to collect information, such as mobile identifiers (e.g., IDFAs and Android Advertising IDs), and information related to how mobile devices and their users interact with our Services and those using our Services. The SDK is computer code that app developers can include in their apps to enable ads to be shown, data to be collected, and related services to be implemented. We may use this technology, for instance, to identify users through mobile applications and browsers based on information associated with your mobile device. We do not collect advertising identifiers such as IDFAs or Android Advertising IDs. 

**Social Media Widgets. [](#social-media-widgets "Direct link to Social Media Widgets.")**   The OneSignal Website may include social media features, such as the Twitter button, and widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on the website, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on the website. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it. 

**Do Not Track Signals. [](#do-not-track-signals "Direct link to Do Not Track Signals.")**  OneSignal currently does not respond to browser do not track (DNT) signals, so we may not be aware of, or may be unable to respond to, such signals. 

**6\. Data Retention [](#6-data-retention "Direct link to 6. Data Retention ")** 

Generally speaking, we retain the SDK Information and Website Information for as long as reasonably necessary to achieve our objectives as detailed in this Privacy Policy, and to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements. We may delete user information from certain apps that we deem as “inactive,” in-line with applicable privacy laws and privacy best practices, and in response to requests from Clients and individuals. In general, “inactive” apps include apps with no recent messages sent or impressions made, no recent logins by accounts associated with the app, and/or no meaningful changes in user counts. 

When considering the retention period for personal information, we consider the nature, sensitivity, and amount of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized disclosure or use, and our legal, regulatory, tax, accounting and other similar obligations. 

For customers on our free plan, we delete push subscribers that have not been active for the past 18 months. Push subscribers are considered dormant if the subscriber: (1) has not used the customer’s  mobile app or visited the customer’s  website in more than 18 months, or (2) OneSignal has not processed any data points for the subscriber in more than 18 months. For customers on active paid plans, their subscribers will be retained until the customer chooses to delete them. 

**7\. Data Security [](#7-data-security "Direct link to 7. Data Security ")** 

We have reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards in place in our physical facilities and in our computer systems, databases, and communications networks. These safeguards are designed to protect information from unauthorized or illegal access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure and to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility of personal information. In addition, we are SOC 2 Type 2 certified and have a SOC 2 Type 2 report certifying that our security policies and controls meet industry standards. This report captures how we safeguard customer data and how well those controls are operating.  

Note that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure and  we cannot guarantee absolute security of personal information. 

**8\. Children [](#8-children "Direct link to 8. Children ")** 

We do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 18. Our services and our website are directed to and intended for people who are at least 18 years old or older. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from anyone under the age of 18 without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers and databases. 

If our Clients provide us with information about individuals under the age of 18, as a service provider we rely on our Clients to obtain consent (if required by applicable law) or provide opt out rights (if required by law) and otherwise to provide such rights to individuals and their parents or legal guardians as are required by applicable law, contract, or otherwise. 

**9\. Third-Party Websites and Apps [](#9-third-party-websites-and-apps "Direct link to 9. Third-Party Websites and Apps ")** 

We are not responsible for the privacy practices or disclosures of websites and applications that use our Services. Likewise, when you access the OneSignal Website, you may be directed to other websites that are also beyond our control. We encourage you to read the applicable privacy policies and terms and conditions of such third parties and websites, and the industry tools that we have referenced in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy, however, only applies to the OneSignal Site and the Services. 

**10\. European Data - Legal Grounds [](#10-european-data-legal-grounds "Direct link to 10. European Data - Legal Grounds ")** 

If you are a visitor to our OneSignal Website from the European Economic Area, Switzerland or the United Kingdom, our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. 

Our legal grounds for processing your personal information may be one or more of the following:  

* Consent: in some cases, we rely on your consent, which you can withdraw at any time  
* Performance of a contract with you: we might need to process your personal information to perform our obligations or to take steps prior to entering into a contract with you 
* Compliance with law: in some cases, we may have a legal obligation to use or retain your personal data 
* Legitimate interests: we may also process your personal information where it is necessary for our legitimate interests in a way that might be expected as part of running our business and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. 

If we process your personal information on behalf of a Client, we rely on our Client’s legal ground for processing your personal information on their behalf.

**11\. Individuals From Outside the United States [](#11-individuals-from-outside-the-united-states "Direct link to 11. Individuals From Outside the United States ")** 

Data is hosted and stored in Europe and accessed in the United States, as well as other countries where our offices or facilities are located or where our service providers operate. The data protection and other laws of the United States might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. By using the OneSignal Website or Services you consent to your information being transferred to our offices and facilities and to those of our service providers to whom we disclose it.  

_Standard Contractual Clauses_

If you are located in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom or Switzerland, we will protect your personal information when it is transferred outside of your jurisdiction by (a) processing it in a territory that provides an adequate level of protection based on its data protection laws; or (b) implementing appropriate safeguards to protect your personal information, such as relying on the European standard contractual clauses (and the United Kingdom addendum, if applicable). OneSignal currently relies on these European standard contractual clauses for data transfers and the Data Privacy Framework (see below). 

_Data Privacy Framework_ 

OneSignal complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. OneSignal has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (“ **EU-U.S. DPF Principles [](#eu-u-s-dpf-principles "Direct link to EU-U.S. DPF Principles")** ”) with regard to the processing of Personal Data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. OneSignal has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (“ **Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles [](#swiss-u-s-dpf-principles "Direct link to Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles")** ”) with regard to the processing of Personal Data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the DPF principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (“ **DPF [](#dpf "Direct link to DPF")** ”) program, and to view our certification page, please visit [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/list](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/list) . 

OneSignal commits to applying the DPF’s Principles to all Personal Data that OneSignal in the U.S. receives from European Economic Area member countries, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland in reliance on the respective DPF.

Our compliance with the DPF is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In accordance with the DPF, we are also liable for onward transfers to third parties that process personal information in a way that does not follow the DPF. 

Please email us at [privacy@onesignal.com](mailto:privacy@onesignal.com) with any questions, concerns, or complaints about our DPF certification. You can resolve any applicable disputes with us related to our certification free of charge through JAMS ( [https://www.jamsadr.com/DPF-Dispute-Resolution](https://www.jamsadr.com/DPF-Dispute-Resolution) ), an alternative dispute resolution provider based in the United States. You can contact JAMS as described at [https://www.jamsadr.com/DPF-Dispute-Resolution](https://www.jamsadr.com/DPF-Dispute-Resolution) .  

In some situations, the DPF Framework gives you the right to invoke binding arbitration. You can do this to resolve complaints not resolved by other means, as described in Annex I to the DPF Framework ( [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/framework-text](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/framework-text) ) 

OneSignal agrees to periodically review and verify its compliance with the DPF Principles, and to remedy any issues arising out of failure to comply with the DPF Principles. OneSignal acknowledges that its failure to provide an annual self-certification to the U.S. Department of Commerce will remove it from the Department’s list of DPF participants.

Different device configurations, or updates to devices, may affect or change how these settings work. 

Your choice to opt out of “Notifications” from the OneSignal platform will not affect notifications placed by any other organization. 

**Opting Out of Online Interest-Based Advertising by Third Parties**

You can opt out of many of the platforms and service providers that facilitate online interest-based advertising by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance’s consumer education and opt-out page, at http://www.aboutads.info/. This type of opt out is cookie based and specific to each browser, which means that if you replace or upgrade your browser, or delete your cookies, you will need to opt out again. Opting out in this way will not prevent you from receiving ads – it will just make the ads you see less customized to you.
