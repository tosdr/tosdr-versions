Terms of Service
================

Effective Date: September 1, 2019

Terms.
------

These Terms of Service (the "**Terms**") describe your rights and responsibilities when using Tinode Services (the "**Services**"), such as Tinode Cloud Hosting, Support Plans or any other services we may provide to you, the customer. Some sections of these terms only apply to specific Services, as indicated by the headings of the respective paragraph. These Terms do not apply to engagements where an individual contract was entered by the parties.

Legally Binding.
----------------

These Customer Terms form a part of a binding "Contract" between Customer and us. "Customer" is the organization that you represent in agreeing to the Contract. Please make sure you have the necessary authority to enter into the Contract on behalf of Customer before proceeding.

1. **Agreement to Terms.** By using our Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you don't agree to be bound by these Terms, do not use the Services.
2. **Privacy Policy.** Please refer to our [Privacy Policy](https://tinode.co/privacy.html) for information on how we collect, use and disclose information from our users. You acknowledge and agree that your use of the Services is subject to our Privacy Policy.

Changes to Terms or Services.
-----------------------------

We may update the Terms at any time, in our sole discretion. If we do so, we'll let you know either by posting the updated Terms on the Site or through other communications. It’s important that you review the Terms whenever we update them or you use the Services. If you continue to use the Services after we have posted updated Terms, you are agreeing to be bound by the updated Terms. If you don't agree to be bound by the updated Terms, then you may not use the Services anymore. Because our Services are evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Services, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.

Eligibility.
------------

You may use the Services only if you are 18 years or older and capable of forming a binding contract with Tinode LLC and are not barred from using the Services under applicable law.

If you want to use certain features of the Services, you'll have to create an account ("**Account**") with us. It’s important that you provide us with accurate, complete and up-to-date information for your Account and you agree to update such information to keep it accurate, complete and up-to-date. If you don't, we might have to suspend or terminate your Account. You agree that you won’t disclose your Account password to anyone and you'll notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your Account. You're responsible for all activities that occur under your Account, whether or not you know about them.

Content Ownership.
------------------

For purposes of these Terms: (i) "**Content**" means text, graphics, images, software, works of authorship of any kind, and information or other materials that are posted, generated, provided or otherwise made available through the Services; (ii) "**Your Content**" means any Content that Account holders (including you) provide to be made available through the Services, including the content of messages you send to other users of the Services.

Tinode LLC does not claim any ownership rights in any of Your Content and nothing in these Terms will be deemed to restrict any rights that you may have to use and exploit Your Content. Subject to the foregoing, Tinode LLC and its licensors exclusively own all right, title and interest in and to the Services and Content, including all associated intellectual property rights.

Limitation of Liability.
------------------------

1. If we believe that there is a violation of the Customer Terms or any of our other policies that can simply be remedied by removal of certain Content or taking other action, we may directly step in and take what we determine to be appropriate action (including disabling your account) if we believe there is a credible risk of harm to us, the Services, Users, or any third parties.
2. To the maximum extent permitted by law, Tinode LLC offers the Products "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE", and Tinode LLC hereby disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, including but not limited to any implied warranties of title, non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, relating to these Terms.

NEITHER TINODE NOR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING, OR DELIVERING THE SERVICES WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUES, LOST SAVINGS, LOST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, LOSS OF DATA OR GOODWILL, SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE OR SYSTEM FAILURE OR THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT TINODE OR ANY OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
4. IN NO EVENT WILL TINODE'S TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES EXCEED THE AMOUNTS YOU HAVE PAID TO TINODE FOR USE OF THE SERVICES OR FIFTY DOLLARS ($50), IF YOU HAVE NOT HAD ANY PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS TO TINODE, AS APPLICABLE.
