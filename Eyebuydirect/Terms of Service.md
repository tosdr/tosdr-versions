We want each visitor to the Site ("you" — i.e. any natural person acting on the Site with purposes having no relationship to his/her commercial or professional activity) to have a safe, enjoyable visit. That’s why we’ve established the following general terms and conditions so that we (“us” and “you”) know what to expect from each other.

### Shipping and Payment

Production times for prescription lenses vary in business days depending on the intricacy of the prescription and the type of lens required.

When your order ships, you will be sent an email confirmation that includes a tracking number and instructions for how to track your order online.

Please keep in mind that quality assurance technicians inspect and verify each and every eyeglass order. If your eyeglasses happen to fail quality assurance, your expected delivery time will be delayed. You will be kept up-to-date of any delays via email.

Links to Third Party Sites
--------------------------

Occasionally, we may make available a link to a third party's website or some documents provided by third parties. These links will let you leave the Site. The linked sites or third party documents are not under our control and we are not responsible for the contents of any document, linked site or any link contained in a linked site, or any changes or updates to such sites.

Intellectual Property Policy
----------------------------

Because copying can harm rightful owners of IP rights, we drafted the following IP Policy:

You may not infringe any of the intellectual property rights associated with the manufacture, design, branding, and packaging of any products advertised on the Site, nor introduce any modifications to the products supplied by us unless the nature of the delivered product dictates otherwise. Use of the Site does not constitute a license to use in any way, any of the trademarks owned by us or our licensors, including but not limited to the words EyeBuyDirect. All content, designs, text, graphics, software compilations, underlying source codes, and other graphic arrangements together with the compilation (meaning the collection, arrangement, and assembly) of all content on the Site is the property and/or copyright of EyeBuyDirect or its licensors and is protected by the copyright, trademark, and other laws of the United States.

But for Protected Health Information (“PHI”), as that term is defined in privacy regulations issued pursuant to HIPAA, all information you post on the Site or communicate to EyeBuyDirect through the Site including, but not limited to, eyeglass reviews and photographs (collectively, “Submissions”) will forever be the property of EyeBuyDirect subject to EyeBuyDirect’s use, control and copyright protection. You hereby represent that your Submissions do not infringe on the rights of any third party.

Permission is granted to users to download and print one copy of the Site for their own personal, non-commercial use. Any other use of the Site including the reproduction, modification, distribution, transmission, republication, display, or performance of the content of the Site without prior written consent from us is strictly prohibited. Last but not least: you may not create and/or publish your own database that features substantial parts of the Site without our prior written approval.

### Opt-Out

We provide you the opportunity to opt-out of having your personal information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. For example, if you purchase a product/service but do not wish to receive any special offer emails from us, you may opt-out at any time by following the unsubscribe link located at the bottom of each email communication.

If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter.

### Opt-In

EyeBuyDirect is part of the EssilorLuxottica group. By accepting these terms and conditions, you (i) allow us to share your data strictly with companies within the EssilorLuxottica group and (ii) give your express, specific, and informed consent to receive emails of promotional materials concerning optical products and glasses from these companies. Your data will not be shared with any third party company except for specific purposes detailed in our Privacy Policy. Each email sent to you by EyeBuyDirect and/or other companies within our group will include an 'unsubscribe' link.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. The payments are secured and handled by a third-party service provider. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

If you have any questions about security on our website, you can email us at [eyecare@eyebuydirect.com](mailto:eyecare@eyebuydirect.com)

You acknowledge and agree by your use of this site to assume full responsibility for all risk associated with your use of this site, including responsibility for all costs associated with all necessary servicing or repairs of any equipment you use in connection with your use of this website.

Under no circumstances shall we or any other party involved in creating, producing, or distributing the site be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages for loss of profits, good will, use, data or other intangible losses (even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages) that result from (i) the use of or inability to use the site, (ii) the cost of procurement of substitute goods and services resulting from any goods, data, information or services purchased or obtained, or messages received or transactions entered into through or from the site; (iii) unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions or data; (iv) statements or conduct of any third party on the site; or (v) any other matter relating to the service. You hereby acknowledge that this paragraph shall apply to all content, merchandise, and services available through the site. Because some states and provinces do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states and provinces liability is limited to the fullest extent permitted by law. You agree to indemnify and hold us, and our subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, agents, co-branders or other partners, and employees, harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of content you submit, post to or transmit through the site, your use of the site, your connection to the site, your violation of the terms of use, or your violation of any rights of another.

You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate services, third-party content or third-party software. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms and Conditions of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
