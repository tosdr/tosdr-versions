Terms and Conditions of Use
===========================

Thank you for visiting EyeBuyDirect.com! — an Essilor Group US Inc. website (the "Site").

EyeBuyDirect is a leading online retail store and source for all things eyewear. The Site is designed by us, EyeBuyDirect ("we" and "us"), a company with limited liability situated in and vested under the laws of Dallas TX, to provide a convenient, private, and informative shopping experience for consumers to purchase eyewear and eyewear related products — 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

We offer a large selection of eyewear and eyewear related products, along with a wealth of information designed to help consumers make educated purchasing decisions. We want each visitor to the Site ("you" — i.e. any natural person acting on the Site with purposes having no relationship to his/her commercial or professional activity) to have a safe, enjoyable visit. That’s why we’ve established the following general terms and conditions so that we (“us” and “you”) know what to expect from each other.

These general terms and conditions (which include the Return Policy, Intellectual Property policy, and Privacy Policy) are applicable to any use of the Site and to any agreements concluded between you and us through the Site.

We encourage you to review the Site and the General Terms and Conditions periodically for any updates or changes. By accessing the Site, using its current or future services and/or buying eyeglasses or other optical products through the Site, you agree that you have read, understood and agree to be bound by these Terms of Use. Your continued access or use of the Site shall also be deemed to be your acceptance of any updates and changes, and of the reasonableness of these Terms of Use.

Account Information and certain other information about you are subject to our Privacy Policy. Please review our Privacy Policy to understand our privacy-related practices.

You hereby consent to our contacting your eye care provider, or providing a copy of your original prescription to us, if necessary, to verify your prescription information and any other necessary information.

Color and Product Description
-----------------------------

We have made every effort to display as accurately as possible the colors of our products that appear on the Site. However, as the actual colors you see will depend on your monitor, we cannot guarantee that your monitor's display of any color will be accurate. We have attempted to be as accurate as possible.

Eyeglasses Policy
-----------------

### Shipping and Payment

Production times for prescription lenses vary in business days depending on the intricacy of the prescription and the type of lens required.

When your order ships, you will be sent an email confirmation that includes a tracking number and instructions for how to track your order online.

Please keep in mind that quality assurance technicians inspect and verify each and every eyeglass order. If your eyeglasses happen to fail quality assurance, your expected delivery time will be delayed. You will be kept up-to-date of any delays via email.

### Prescription

When you are fitted for eyeglasses by your Eye Care Practitioner, they should provide you with a paper copy of your prescription.

### Opt-In

EyeBuyDirect is part of the EssilorLuxottica group. By accepting these terms and conditions, you (i) allow us to share your data strictly with companies within the EssilorLuxottica group and (ii) give your express, specific, and informed consent to receive emails of promotional materials concerning optical products and glasses from these companies.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. The payments are secured and handled by a third-party service provider. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

Under no circumstances shall we or any other party involved in creating, producing, or distributing the site be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages for loss of profits, good will, use, data or other intangible losses (even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages) that result from (i) the use of or inability to use the site, (ii) the cost of procurement of substitute goods and services resulting from any goods, data, information or services purchased or obtained, or messages received or transactions entered into through or from the site; (iii) unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions or data; (iv) statements or conduct of any third party on the site; or (v) any other matter relating to the service.
