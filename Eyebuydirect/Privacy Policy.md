3\. SHARING INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES
------------------------------------------

We may share the personal information that we collect about you in the following ways:

We engage service providers to perform services in connection with the operation of our business. We may share personal information with service providers to the extent necessary for them to provide services to you or us that are aligned with the purposes outlined above. Examples of these services include payment processing and authorization, text messaging services, fraud protection and credit risk reduction, product customization, order fulfillment and shipping, marketing and promotional material distribution, website evaluation, data analysis and, where applicable, data cleansing.

In proceeding with your online order, you agree that any information associated with the order, such as the delivery name and address (if different from yours), will be processed using service providers.

Personal information collected through our Platforms may be shared between the brands and affiliates, including future affiliates that are owned or operated by Luxottica.

We also share personal information with selected third parties for their own marketing purposes (except for your phone number or biometric information). This also includes information collected through pixels and other tracking technologies operated by third parties, as described elsewhere in this Policy. See the “**YOUR CHOICES**” section of this Policy for more information.

We may release personal information if we believe in good faith that: (i) the law or legal process requires it; (ii) we have received a valid administrative request from a law enforcement agency; or (iii) such release is necessary or appropriate (in our sole discretion) to protect the rights, property, or safety of Luxottica, or any of our respective affiliates, service providers, customers, or (iv) as Luxottica deems necessary to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, prevent fraud and otherwise enforce the Terms of Use.

We may also share your information with your consent or as otherwise disclosed at the time of data collection or sharing.

As with any business, it is possible that as ours develops, we might go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or the sale of all or a portion of our assets, or buying online stores or other assets, including bankruptcy. In such transactions, information about customers will likely be transferred.

The Platforms may allow you to provide comments in various sections, such as in product reviews. Please be aware that the information you post in these areas may be available to visitors of the Platforms and to the general public. To the fullest extent allowed under applicable law, we do not monitor such content and are not responsible for material posted by you or others in these public forums.

We are a multinational organization with locations in many countries around the world. Your personal information may be stored and processed outside of your country, province or state of residence, in any jurisdiction where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers, to the extent allowed in accordance with applicable law. This means that your personal information may be transferred in jurisdictions that have less restrictive privacy laws than your country, province, or state of residence in which case we will ensure, through contractual means or otherwise, that it will receive adequate protection in compliance with generally accepted data protection principles. We take steps to process personal information according to the provisions of this Privacy Policy and the requirements of applicable law.

4\. COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES
-------------------------------------------

Like many other companies, we use cookies and other tracking technologies (such as pixels and web beacons) (collectively, “Cookies”). To learn more about how we use cookies and to change your cookie settings, please see our Cookie Policy below.

5\. DIGITAL ADVERTISING & ANALYTICS / INTEREST-BASED ADS
--------------------------------------------------------

We may partner with ad networks and other ad serving providers (“Advertising Providers”) that serve ads on behalf of us and others on the Platforms and non-affiliated platforms. Some of those ads may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on information Advertising Providers collect about your use of the Platforms and other sites or apps over time, including information about relationships among different browsers and devices (“Interest-based Advertising”).

You may choose whether to receive some Interest-based Advertising by submitting opt outs. Some Advertising Providers may participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding Interest-based Advertising, visit [https://www.aboutads.info/choices](https://www.aboutads.info/choices), and [https://www.aboutads.info/appchoices](https://www.aboutads.info/appchoices) for information on the DAA’s opt-out program for mobile apps.

Some of these companies may also be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). To learn more about the NAI and the opt-out options for their members, see [https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices](https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices). Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of Interest-based Advertising, you may continue to receive other types of ads.

Opting out only means that those selected members should no longer deliver certain Interest-based Advertising to you but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit these opt-out webpages, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different device or web browser or use a non-browser-based method of access (e.g., mobile app), your NAI / DAA browser-based opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective. We support the ad industry’s 2009 Self-regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising ([https://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ven-principles-07-01-09.pdf](https://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ven-principles-07-01-09.pdf)) and expect that ad networks we directly engage to serve you Interest-based Advertising will do so as well, though we cannot guarantee their compliance. We are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third parties’ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.

Advertising Providers may use data collected in connection with our advertising campaigns for the following purposes:

For measurement and insight reporting (to produce and provide us with reports measuring the impact and performance of our advertising campaigns).

To produce benchmarking reports to share with their other customers, but such benchmarking reports will not identify you.

To target our ad campaigns to specific groups of individuals having particular characteristics.

To improve and optimize advertising services (for example, to support the objectives of our ad campaigns, improve the effectiveness of their own advertising services and determine the relevance of ads to individuals).

To personalize ads that the Advertising Providers show, including to enhance user profiles with inferred interests.

For their internal purposes, including: (i) to promote and ensure the safety and security on and of their products and services; (ii) to detect and prevent malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, invalid or illegal activity; (iii) for research and development purposes; and (iv) to maintain the integrity of and to improve their products and services.

To combine it with other data collected by Advertising Providers in order to provide greater insights in respect of our advertisements.

We may also work with service providers that collect data about your use of the Sites and other sites or apps over time for non-advertising purposes subject to their privacy policies. We use analytics providers such as Google Analytics to gather and analyze aggregated anonymous user information. For more information about Google Analytics, please visit [www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/). You can opt out of Google’s collection and processing of data generated by your use of the Sites by going to [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

We use web analytics tools to enhance user experience by optimizing the efficiency, design, and quality of the Platforms. Our analytics tools use cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information related to user behavioral metrics on the Platforms, such as mouse movements, clicks, user inputs, scrolling, access time, visit duration, pages viewed, IP address (including approximate location), operating system, and page reloading. These tools provide insight into what works and what doesn’t work for users of the Platforms and they allow us to, for example, identify and repair technical errors such as broken links that impair the Platforms’ functionality. The web analytics tools also help us reconstruct the user experience to better understand, for example, where users may be encountering frustration or impediments to using the Platforms.

We use a website analytics tool that provides session replay, heatmaps, funnels, form analytics, feedback campaigns, and similar features/functionality. This session replay software may record your clicks, mouse movements, scrolling, form fills (keystrokes) in non-excluded fields, pages visited and content, time on site, browser, operating system, device type (desktop/tablet/phone), screen resolution, visitor type (first time/returning), anonymized IP address, location (city/country), language, and similar metadata. This software does not collect information on pages where it is not installed, nor does it track or collect information outside your web browser.

We use this web-based analytics software because it gives us a tool to track the online behavior of visitors while on the Platforms and lets us replay visitors’ actions. This tool gives us the opportunity to make the Platforms better and, in turn, provide you with an enhanced online experience as well. Thanks to this tool, we are able to gain insight on how you and other visitors use the Platforms; for example, whether you can easily locate the “Find a Store” page or whether it takes multiple clicks to get to that page. Information about these small choices and interactions are of paramount value to us, as they can easily make your experience better and more intuitive and, more importantly, allow us to provide you with a more seamless, customer-friendly e-shopping experience while on the Platforms.

For more information on this session replay software, see Contentsquare’s Privacy Policy at [https://contentsquare.com/privacy-center/privacy-policy/](https://contentsquare.com/privacy-center/privacy-policy/).

We may use pixel tags (also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) to, among other things, track the actions of users of the Services (including email recipients), measure the success of our marketing campaigns, and compile statistics about usage of the services and response rates. Our Advertising Providers may use pixel tags to collect information for the purposes described above.

The Platforms may provide links to third-party websites or apps, including our social media pages. We do not control the privacy practices of those websites or apps, and they are not covered by this Policy. You should review the privacy policies of other websites or apps that you use to learn about their data practices.

The Platforms may also include integrated social media tools or “plug-ins,” such as social networking tools offered by third parties. If you use these tools to share information or you otherwise interact with social media features on the Platforms, those social media companies may collect information about you and may use and share such information in accordance with their own policies, including by sharing such information with us or the general public. Your interactions with third-party social media companies and the use of their features are governed by the privacy policies of the companies that provide those features. We encourage you to read the privacy policies for any social media accounts you create and use.

7\. BIOMETRIC INFORMATION WE COLLECT
------------------------------------

Through various technology features, including but not limited to our virtual technology features and/or when you upload a photo through one of our Platforms, we may collect data that potentially falls under the definitions of “biometric identifiers” or “biometric information” under the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, 740 ILCS § 14/1 et seq. and Texas Capture or Use of Biometric Identifier Act (“CUBI”), Bus. & Com. § 503.001 et seq. “Biometric identifiers” are defined as retina or iris scans, fingerprints, voiceprints, or scans of the hand or face geometry. “Biometric information,” means any information, regardless of how it is captured, converted, stored, or shared, based on an individual’s biometric identifier used to identify an individual.

Any collection of biometric identifiers and biometric information are for the sole purpose of assisting you in viewing how certain eyeglasses may look on your facial features. We will not disclose or disseminate any biometric information to any entity, other than those contracted parties that assist us in providing this service to you, or as required by applicable federal, state or local law, or required pursuant to a valid warrant or subpoena issued by a court of competent jurisdiction.

We will not share your biometric identifiers and biometric information with any entity except in the following cases:

We will share your biometric identifiers and biometric information with contacted parties that assist us in providing services to you via our Platforms

We will share your biometric identifiers and biometric information where it is required by applicable federal, provincial, or local law

We will share your biometric identifiers and biometric information where it is required pursuant to a valid warrant or subpoena issued by a court of competent jurisdiction

We shall retain any biometric identifiers or biometric information for the limited period of time required to provide you with the service, and shall not exceed six months as long as you consent to such retention, maintain an account with us, and expressly request to save your virtual profile to your account. If you do not maintain an account with us we shall retain biometric identifiers or biometric information for up to six months, but we will not be able to retrieve or connect your information to your identity. After six months, all biometric identifiers or biometric information we have collected from you shall no longer be retrievable or readable by our operating systems or applications.

We use appropriate technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to store, transmit, and protect from disclosure any biometric identifiers or biometric information collected. Such storage, transmission, and protection from disclosure shall be performed in a manner that is the same or more protective than the manner in which we store, transmit, and protect from disclosure other confidential and sensitive information.

Biometric information will only be collected by us with your prior explicit consent. Before using our virtual technology features, you will be prompted with a copy of this policy. By clicking “I accept” you are consenting to our collection and storage of your biometric identifiers or biometric information.
