    United States consumers have the ability to request information or to make inquiries from Weber regarding use of your data by visiting our [data access ticket system](https://app-de.onetrust.com/app/#/webform/616bbec2-6fcf-47bd-805a-e1c33281ba92 "Data Access Ticket System").  The data access ticket system is operated by a reputable third party. Only Weber representatives will respond to and address your inquiry, but the third party operating the system will collect information including IP address, information collected by cookies, log information, referring website, and information you provide in submitting your request to Weber, such as your first and last name, email, country and details of your request.

    Where required by applicable law, you have a right to request access to your personal information, to request a correction to it if you believe it is inaccurate, or exercise other rights to your personal information. If you have submitted personal information to Weber and would like to exercise such rights, please contact us using the contact information provided below. We may require you to verify your identity before we provide you with access to your information. We will use reasonable efforts to comply with your requests; however, in some cases we may not be able to allow you to access certain personal information (for example if it contains personal information of other persons or for legal reasons). In such cases, we will provide you with a reasonable explanation of why it is not possible to grant access to your personal information.
    
* **B. Data security**
    
    Weber implements reasonable technical and organizational security measures, including physical, organizational and technological protection, (such as the use of SSL encryption for certain components of the Applications) to help protect accruing or collected personal information against accidental or intentional manipulation, loss, destruction or attacks by unauthorized persons. Our security measures are continuously being improved as new technologies become available and following our regular review of our current data security, access and protection practices. Personal information may be accessed by persons within our organization, or our third party service providers, who require such access to carry out the purposes indicated above, or such other purposes as may be permitted or required by the applicable law.
    
    Although we have taken measures to help protect our Applications, computer systems and any personal information that we have collected from unauthorized use, access, disclosure, misuse, alteration or destruction, no security measures can provide absolute protection. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you provide to us.

    Some or all of the personal information we collect may be stored or processed on servers located outside your jurisdiction of residence, whose data protection laws may differ from the jurisdiction in which you live.

* **D. Information Specific to the Website.**
    
    The specific scope and mode of collection and use of your data depends on whether you are just visiting our website (e.g. for viewing the products we offer) or whether you are actually using specific services (e.g. if you order products).
    
    i. For Browsing the Website
    
    If you use the Weber website for browsing only, generally you are not required to provide any personal information (though certain aspects of the site may utilize such information if available). In this case (and apart from these other aspects of the site as described in this Policy), we collect and use those of your data which your Internet browser transmits to us automatically, such as:
    
    * Date and time of the visit of any of our websites
    * Type of your browser
    * Browser settings
    * The operating system you use
    * The website last visited by you
    * The data volume transmitted and the access status (file transmitted, file not found etc.) and
    * Your IP address.
    
      
    
    If you visit a Weber website for browsing only (and have not created a Weber-ID or otherwise provided Weber with more specific information), we collect and use this data in non-personal form. This is done to generally enable the use of the websites you visit as well as for statistical purposes and for improving our web presence and the services we provide there.
    
    ii. Use of Specific Services / Shopping at a Weber Website / Marketing
    
    We will collect personal information if you voluntarily disclose such data to us when you shop or purchase products on the Website, when interacting with our Customer Service/Online Consumer Care team through email, phone, or via online or telephonic text message/chats (whether you are interacting directly with our online consumer care team, utilizing interactive voice response, or utilizing optional third party chat bot service that may be made available to you), for the purposes of receiving marketing communications, or when opening a customer account. Please note that your interactions with any of these methods may be recorded for quality assurance purposes. We use the collected data to perform the services you request and send you related transaction communications, and provide you with relevant marketing to the extent we have obtained your consent to do so.
    
    Please note that we may use information provided when you purchase a registrable product for yourself in order to automatically register your product for warranty purposes.
    

**3\. Use of Data for Advertising Purposes**

Weber wants to make sure you are up to date and involved on our newest **_Innovations_** , including products, technologies and other offerings. With this in mind, in this Section of the Policy, we discuss our use of your data for advertising and consumer insights and research purposes.

**A. Generally**

In addition to performing services for you as part of the Applications, we are eager to provide an Internet and mobile presence that is specific to your interests and may provide certain marketing or advertising information to you as provided for in this Section. In addition, if you opt in to participate within the Applications, device settings or through other channels, we will provide you from time to time with such news and information about Weber or the products we offer by mail, email (through our email list), Internet websites, text message, and push notifications that might be of interest to you (including through our analysis of your data, as detailed above). Please note that the operating system on your mobile device may default to activating push notifications. The emails will be facilitated by a respected third party, in which case the email addresses of recipients of the Weber emails will be stored on servers of such provider. The provider uses this data to send and analyze the emails on behalf of Weber. Examples of topics referenced in such emails include browsing/shopping related emails (which are not otherwise transaction-related), content specific to products you purchase or register, grilling tips and recipes, sales, offers and promotions, market research and feedback, and product suggestions/new product information.

Please note that with regard to push notifications, when you do activate them you thereby consent into us sending you these marketing related notifications. You can deactivate the service at any time in the Mobile App's, or your mobile device's, settings.

To the extent we have obtained your permission to do so and in accordance with applicable law, we may share your personal information with third parties for their own marketing purposes, which are subject to the separate privacy policies of such third parties.

Weber may contact you from time to time through certain reputable third party firms for market research purposes, to the extent you have provided your consent for us to do so. Participation in any such activities by you is strictly voluntary and you can always opt-out of these communications, as further detailed below.

Your opt-out does not apply to communications relating to Applications information (including policy updates), Legal Notice, Weber-ID, purchases, Customer Service/Online Consumer Care matters, or automatically generated non-commercial messages (confirmation emails, order receipts, etc.). To the extent you have provided consent to receive text messages or push notifications, you can opt-out of such messages by following the instructions in the communication, replying back, or visiting the settings on your mobile device.

**B. Social Media and Online Platforms**

When you use the Applications, please note that we may share your hashed email addresses, as well as other pseudonymous identifiers and data about your use of the Applications and your device if applicable, with Facebook and other social media networks, as well as other online platforms and related reputable service providers, in order to utilize services which may include but are not limited to Facebook's Custom Audience and pixel services.

Otherwise, only after you have actively clicked the applicable link yourself, your Internet browser will establish a connection to the servers of the relevant social network; therefore, by clicking the appropriate button (e.g. "Like"), you give your consent to your Internet browser establishing a connection to the servers of the relevant social network and transmitting data relating to the use of the website to the relevant social network provider.

Once engaged with the relevant social media website, your use and browsing will be governed by the data protection statements/privacy policies of the relevant providers.
