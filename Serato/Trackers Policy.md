Our promises
------------

We’re committed to supporting the global music community and delivering the relevant, awesome, content for our users via cookies and similar technologies. So you understand what we are up to and feel comfortable, we’ve made some promises;

1. ### Clear purpose
    
    We will only use your data to improve your experience with us and show you the latest heat from Serato.
    
2. ### Transparency
    
    You will always have information available regarding exactly how we use cookies.
    
3. ### Straight talking
    
    You can update your cookie preference at any time via this page. If you start missing our dope content, you can re-subscribe. You’re welcome.
    
4. ### Relevant communications
    
    You’ll only hear from us if we think it’s informative, interesting, or going to take your DJing and/or Production to the next level.
    
5. ### Just the essentials
    
    If we don’t need your data, we don’t record it.
    
6. ### We don't sell your data
    
    This is especially important - your cookie and website usage data is not sold in any shape or form to any third parties.
    

What are Cookies?
-----------------

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on your hard drive or in device memory for record keeping purposes.

We use cookies to give you a better and more personalised experience, remember your preferences, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, help us measure the effectiveness of ads, and give us insights into user behavior so we can improve our communications and user experience.

### Functional

These cookies allow you to navigate the site and use key features. Please note, you cannot opt-out from these. Our site would not work!

### Analytics and Advertising

Analytics cookies allow us to measure and analyse how people use our site. This allows us to improve both its functionality and your experience.

Advertising cookies allow us to provide you with relevant and personalized communications. So without advertising cookies, online content you encounter will be less relevant to you and your interests. Advertising is considered to be things like sales, but also content like the latest mix from your favourite artist.

These cookies also make your social media newsfeed content more relevant too. But if you’re tired of seeing dope content from Serato, you can update your social media privacy settings at any time.

Please note: social media companies use advertising to keep the lights on. So deleting your cookies and updating your privacy settings won’t stop you from seeing ads. They’ll just become less relevant to you and your interests.

Why do we use Cookies?
----------------------

### To give you the best experience we can

Cookies allow us to provide the best, most relevant, experience possible across internet platforms such as social media with our communications. An example of this is serving the users of our site with the latest software release updates via social media.

### I don’t like Cookies

That’s cool. If you want to delete any Cookies that are already on your device from Serato, use the switch below. If you’d like to remove Cookies from other websites check out the help section in your browser. This should provide instructions on how to delete these.

Please note, that by deleting or disabling future cookies, your user experience may be affected and you might not be able to take advantage of certain functions of our site and you will be a lot less likely to see the latest content from Serato.

Managing your cookie preference
-------------------------------

It’s really easy. Simply click on the toggle below to choose your preference. Please note that this is only for the browser and device you are on currently.
