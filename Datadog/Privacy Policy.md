5. Retention
    ---------
    
    We only keep your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, after which it will be deleted or archived unless we are required to keep it to comply with our legal obligations or for another legitimate and lawful purpose.

Your rights with respect to your personal information are outlined above in the “Your rights” section above.
    
    We comply with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce (together, the “DPF”), and we have certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that we adhere to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and from the United Kingdom (and Gibraltar) in reliance on the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF (together, the “DPF Principles”).

More information about the safeguards we’ve implemented to protect transfers of personal data is available in our [Datadog Transfer Impact Assessment](https://www.datadoghq.com/legal/data-transfer-impact-assessment/).
