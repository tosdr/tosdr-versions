If you do not accept these Terms, do not use the Site or any of its Content (defined below).

You represent to Datadog that you are lawfully able to enter into contracts (e.g., you are not a minor). If you are entering into these Terms for an entity, such as the company you work for, you represent that you have authority to bind that entity and you agree that “you” as used in these Terms includes both you personally and the entity you represent. You and Datadog are collectively referred to as the “**Parties**” and each is a “**Party**”.

Master Subscription Agreement

These Terms do not govern the use of the hosted application and infrastructure monitoring service as well as other services (the “**Service**”) operated by Datadog. If you are accessing or using the Service – even if you are doing so through a free trial – then you are subject to Datadog’s Master Subscription Agreement (currently available at [https://datadoghq.com/legal/msa](https://datadoghq.com/legal/msa)) or such other written contract as may be separately agreed between you and Datadog.

    ----------------------
    
    The Site is provided to the U.S. Government as “commercial items,” “commercial computer software,” “commercial computer software documentation,” and “technical data” with the same rights and restrictions generally applicable to the Site. If you are using the Site on behalf of the U.S. Government and these terms fail to meet the U.S. Government’s needs or are inconsistent in any respect with federal law, you must immediately discontinue use of the Site. The terms listed above are defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation and the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement.
    
16. Termination and Monitoring
    --------------------------
    
    1. If you violate these Terms, Datadog may suspend or terminate your use of the Site. Datadog’s right to suspend or terminate your use of Site applies even if a breach is committed unintentionally or without your authorization if Datadog believes that suspension or termination is necessary to ensure compliance with Applicable Laws or to protect the rights, safety, privacy, security or property of Datadog, its customers or third parties.
    2. Datadog reserves the right, but does not assume the obligation, to investigate any violation of these Terms or misuse of the Site. Datadog has the right in its sole discretion to edit, refuse to post or remove any Content posted, displayed, published or made available for download or use on the Site that Datadog finds to be in violation of these Terms. Datadog may report any activity that it suspects violates any law or regulation to appropriate law enforcement officials, regulators, or other appropriate third parties. Such reporting may include disclosing appropriate customer data. Datadog also may cooperate with appropriate law enforcement agencies, regulators, or other appropriate third parties to help with the investigation and prosecution of illegal conduct.
17. Electronic Communications
    -------------------------
    
    When you visit the Site or send emails to Datadog, you are communicating with Datadog electronically; and you consent to receive communications from Datadog electronically.

    Datadog may modify these Terms at any time by posting a revised version on the Site. By accessing the Site, you agree to the latest version of these Terms.
    
19. Governing Law
    -------------
    
    This Agreement will be interpreted, construed and enforced in all respects in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without reference to its choice of law principles. Any legal action or proceeding arising under or relating to this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in the state or federal courts located in New York County, New York, USA, and the Parties expressly consent to personal jurisdiction and venue in those courts.
    
20. Miscellaneous
    -------------
    
    These Terms constitute the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement between the Parties and supersede all proposals, oral or written, and all other communications between the Parties relating to the subject matter of these Terms. In the event any information posted on the Site from time to time conflicts with any provision of these Terms, the applicable provision of these Terms shall control. Any terms and conditions of any other instrument issued by you in connection with these Terms which are in addition to, inconsistent with or different from these Terms shall be of no force or effect. These Terms do not, and shall not be construed to, create any partnership, joint venture, employer-employee, agency or franchisor-franchisee relationship between you and Datadog. You may not assign, transfer or sublicense all or any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without Datadog’s express prior written consent. Datadog may assign, transfer or sublicense all or any of Datadog’s rights or obligations under these Terms without restriction. The failure of Datadog to exercise or enforce any condition, term or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such condition, term or provision. Any waiver by Datadog of any condition, term or provision of these Terms shall not be construed as a waiver of any other condition, term or provision. If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of these Terms shall continue in full force and effect. You agree that a printed version of these Terms and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to these Terms to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. Datadog will not be responsible for failures to fulfill any obligations due to causes beyond its control. Non-English translations of these Terms may be provided for convenience only. In the event of any ambiguity or conflict between translations, the English version is authoritative and controls.
