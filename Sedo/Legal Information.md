**Domain Transfer Service Terms and Conditions**
================================================

**Version: 01 March 2023**

These Terms and Conditions for the Domain Transfer Service are translated into English, French, Spanish and Chinese and are available to the Customer online. The contractual language is English. Any translation of these Terms and Conditions into another language is therefore for information purposes only. In the event of any ambiguity or discrepancy, the English language version shall control.

### 1\. Introduction

These are the Terms and Conditions of Sedo.com, LLC (hereinafter referred to as "Sedo") for the Domain Transfer Service (hereinafter also referred to as "Domain Transfer Service Agreement", “Domain Transfer Service Terms“, “Terms”, or "Agreement").

These Domain Transfer Service Terms shall become effective upon their electronic acceptance. This Agreement governs the terms and conditions for the use of Sedo’s Domain Transfer Service (hereinafter referred to as the “Domain Transfer Service”, the “Transfer Service” or the “Service”). By accepting these Domain Transfer Service Terms, Customer acknowledges that you have read, have understood, and agree to be bound by these Domain Transfer Service Terms.

### 2\. Scope

The business relationship between Sedo and you shall be governed by:

* the following Domain Transfer Service Terms and Conditions, and
* the Sedo General Terms and Conditions (hereinafter referred to as "User Terms”),

in each case, in their version valid at the time of their electronic acceptance between Sedo and you, and whereby all provisions of the User Terms are to be applied, provided that no deviating provisions have been made in these Domain Transfer Service Terms. In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of the User Terms and the provisions of these Domain Transfer Service Terms, the provisions of these Domain Transfer Service Terms shall prevail. All regulations of the User Terms remain in full force and unaffected by the Domain Transfer Service Terms, if they are not expressly changed by the Domain Transfer Service Terms.

Any deviating terms and conditions provided by the User shall not be recognized unless Sedo expressly agrees to their applicability in writing. In addition, special terms and conditions may apply to individual business relationships that contain deviations from or additions to the User Terms or the following Domain Transfer Service Terms. In this case, any special terms and conditions will be agreed separately with you in writing and will have priority.

If either the Buyer or the Seller has ordered Sedo's Domain Brokerage Service, a Purchase and Sale Agreement has been effectively concluded, and the subsequent Domain Transfer Service is used, the provisions for the Domain Transfer Service for the Buyer or Seller represented in the Brokerage Service are based on the Domain Transfer provisions made in the Domain Brokerage Terms and Conditions. For the unrepresented party within the scope of the Domain Brokerage Service, the regulations for the Domain Transfer Service described hereafter shall apply.

### 3\. Modes of Communication

Sedo will make all instructions and information required to carry out the Domain Transfer Service available to you via the Transfer Center on the Website. Sedo is not obliged to contact you using any other contact data that may be on file for you. If a notification is posted in the Transfer Center, you will additionally be notified by an email sent to the email address stored in your User account details. The fact that you may not be informed about notifications in the Transfer Center does not absolve you of your contractual obligations. You must ensure that you are contactable via the email address stated in your Sedo User account.

### 4\. Description of Domain Transfer Service

The Domain Transfer Service offers Sedo's assistance with the transfer of a registration of, or legal right to register, an Internet domain name (“Domain”) that is the subject of a Purchase and Sale Agreement whereby a domain buyer (“Buyer”) has agreed to purchase the Domain from a domain owner (“Seller”) for an agreed upon amount (“Purchase Price”).

Content, data, programming or other elements of the website/project and/or any additional consideration included in a Purchase and Sale Agreement between Buyer and Seller are outside the scope of the Domain Transfer Service and the transfer or payment for such shall be the sole responsibility of Buyer and Seller. Buyer and Seller agree that they are solely responsible for the transfer of any and all elements of a transaction outside the Domain and Purchase Price and that once the Domain Transfer Service is initiated and accepted by Sedo, neither party will request cancellation of the Agreement of the Domain Transfer Service due to a dispute over such.

Drafting of a custom Purchase and Sale Agreements, enforcing the terms of such agreements between Buyer and Seller, or any legal consultations on the part of Sedo are not included in the Domain Transfer Service and must be obtained from User's own legal representative.

### 5\. Rights and Duties of Sedo

### 5.1 Legal Status of Sedo and Acceptance of Service Orders

Sedo acts here neither as a Buyer or Seller, nor as the representative of a Buyer or a Seller, nor as a broker. Sedo reserves the right to review and accept or reject any orders for the Domain Transfer Service in its sole discretion. This includes, but is not limited to, rejecting any orders in which the Purchase Price is less than the fees owed to Sedo pursuant to this Agreement, the [Price List](https://sedo.com/us/what-we-offer/price-list/), or any other agreement for services related to the Domain.

### 5.2 Transferring the Domain

Sedo shall instruct the Buyer and the Seller of the Domain as to the required steps and best practices involved in the technical domain name registration transfer process. Sedo can only ensure the prompt and orderly transfer of the Domain if Sedo's instructions to the Buyer and Seller are strictly followed.

A successful transfer of the Domain has taken place when the Seller has relinquished technical control of the Domain and no longer needs to take any actions to allow the Buyer to gain technical control of the Domain (“Successful Transfer”). In lieu of direct knowledge of the shift in technical control, you acknowledge that a Successful Transfer will also be considered to have taken place if (a) the Buyer modifies the Domain’s public WHOIS record, (b) Sedo receives confirmation from the Buyer’s registrar or the registry that the Buyer has control of the Domain, (c) the Buyer confirms receipt of the Domain in writing (including through the Transfer Center) or (d) the Buyer has not replied to Sedo’s requests for confirmation of Buyer’s control of the Domain within five (5) days of the first request from Sedo. In the case of the latter, Buyer’s silence in response to Sedo’s requests shall constitute Buyer’s confirmation of control of the Domain.

A Successful Transfer may also occur in those cases where Sedo, at its sole discretion, assumes temporary control of the Domain on behalf of the Buyer and Seller to effectuate the transfer. In the event Sedo assumes control of a Domain during the transfer process, Sedo is not obligated to Buyer or Seller to maintain or alter the Domain’s domain server settings or otherwise display content of any kind on the Domain.

### 5.3 Registrar Accounts

Sedo may, at its sole discretion, coordinate with the Customer’s registrars to obtain control of the Domain in order to expedite the Service. This may take the form of temporarily holding the Domain in a registrar account assigned to Sedo. Customer authorizes Sedo to transfer the Domain to a registrar account assigned to the Buyer only once the Buyer has remitted payment as per Section 6.2 of this Agreement. Customer acknowledges that Sedo is at no point the owner or registrant of the Domain and you agree to indemnify Sedo for any reasonable damages or costs incurred should the Domain be used to infringe upon the rights of a third party.

### 5.4 Payment of Purchase Price

Sedo may, at its sole discretion and where in compliance with local regulations, require Buyer to remit the Purchase Price to a bank account designated by Sedo in order to expedite payment to the Seller and ensure payment of any fees owed by either party to Sedo. Sedo shall only initiate the disbursement of the Purchase Price to the Seller after there has been a Successful Transfer as per Section 5.2 of this Agreement.

Alternatively, Sedo may also commission a payment service provider to process payments for this purpose. Customer hereby expressly agrees to accept the payment service provider's contractual terms and conditions. Refusal to do so constitutes a material breach of these Domain Transfer Terms.

### 5.5 Anonymity

Sedo may, at its sole discretion, restrict the identity of the Customer during any portion of the Domain Transfer Process to provide anonymity for the parties to the Purchase and Sale Agreement. Both during and after the Domain Transfer Process, Sedo shall not provide any identity information beyond the name, address and e-mail address of the Customer without that Customer’s explicit consent unless required by law.

### 5.6 Disputes between Buyer and Seller

CUSTOMER AGREES THAT SEDO SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SEEKING ENFORCEMENT OF ANY PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT.

In the event that the Buyer and Seller become involved in a dispute at any time during the Domain Transfer Service with the underlying Purchase and Sale Agreement or these Domain Transfer Terms, Sedo may temporarily stop providing the Service at its sole discretion and may set a reasonable deadline for the parties to reach an acceptable agreement. In the event that said deadline passes without a resolution, Sedo reserves the right to cancel the Domain Transfer Service. At that point, the aggrieved party, either Buyer or Seller, may exercise their right to initiate a legal process or proceeding against the other party. Both Buyer and Seller agree that Sedo is not responsible or liable in any way for a purchase and sale transaction ending in this manner.

### 5.7 Cancellation of the Service

Sedo reserves the right to cancel the Domain Transfer Service ("Failed Transfer") for the following reasons. Sedo may cancel the Domain Transfer Service if any provisions of the Purchase and Sale Agreement conflict with the provisions of this Agreement. Sedo may cancel the Domain Transfer Service because of a dispute between the Buyer and Seller pursuant to Section 5.6 of this Agreement. Sedo may cancel the Domain Transfer Service if Buyer or Seller fails to fulfill its obligation to cooperate in the transfer process after two (2) requests are made by Sedo via the Transfer Center. Sedo may cancel the Domain Transfer Service if the Service violates the local regulations of either Sedo’s, the Buyer’s or Seller’s jurisdiction. Sedo may cancel the Domain Transfer Service if either party to the Purchase and Sale Agreement materially breaches this Agreement.

If Sedo has obtained control of the Domain pursuant to Section 5.3 of this Agreement, Sedo shall return the Domain to the Seller if payment has not been remitted to the Seller or, otherwise, Sedo shall transfer the Domain to the Buyer. If Sedo has received the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 5.4 of this Agreement, Sedo shall return the Purchase Price to the Buyer if the Domain has not been transferred to the Buyer or, otherwise, Sedo shall disburse the Purchase Price to the Seller.

Should either party fail to meet their obligations under this Agreement or the Purchase and Sale Agreement, Sedo shall provide the identity of the breaching User to the injured User upon request.

PROVIDED THAT A CLAIM ORIGINATING FROM A FAILED TRANSFER IS NOT BASED UPON THE INTENTIONAL WRONGDOING OR GROSS NEGLIGENCE OF SEDO, ITS STATUTORY REPRESENTATIVES OR VICARIOUS AGENTS, BUYER AND SELLER AGREE THAT SEDO SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR DETRIMENT OR DAMAGES, ORIGINATING FROM A FAILED TRANSFER CAUSED BY, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, EITHER BUYER OR SELLER (i) REJECTING THE PROPER COMPLETION OF TRANSFER-RELATED DOCUMENTS, (ii) IMPEDING THE EXECUTION OF THE TRANSACTION IN ANOTHER WAY, OR (iii) IN THE CASE WHERE ONE OF THE CONTRACTUAL PARTIES CANNOT BE PROPERLY IDENTIFIED DUE TO PROVIDING INCORRECT OR MISLEADING CONTACT INFORMATION.

### 5.8 Subcontractor

You acknowledge and agree that Sedo may utilize the assistance or service of a third-party provider to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement so long as the identity of the provider is disclosed to you and you will not incur any additional cost for Sedo’s use of the provider’s services. You hereby authorize Sedo to share confidential information regarding the transaction with such a third party provided that the third party is bound to the same degree of care as Sedo to protect that information.

### 6\. Rights and Duties of Domain Buyer

The provisions of this Section 6 shall apply to the Buyer.

### 6.1 Reaching an Agreement

If you have purchased the Domain during the course of a Domain Marketplace bidding process, you are bound by the standard online Purchase and Sale Agreement supplied by Sedo and tailored to the Domain that was the subject of the negotiation. If you have purchased the Domain in conjunction with Sedo’s Brokerage Service, you are bound by the Purchase and Sale Agreement negotiated between you and the Seller. In all other cases, you hereby opt to use the standard online Purchase and Sale Agreement supplied by Sedo and [available for review here](https://sedo.com/us/about-us/policies/purchase-and-sale-agreement/), unless you provide a copy of a different Purchase and Sale Agreement to Sedo when initiating an order for the Domain Transfer Service.

YOU AGREE TO WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO RESCIND THIS AGREEMENT AND/OR THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT WITH THE SELLER, WHETHER OR NOT SUCH RIGHT OF RESCISSION IS BASED ON LOCAL LAW OR CONTRACT. THE WAIVER APPLIES ONLY IF YOU ARE NOT A CONSUMER. FURTHERMORE, YOU EXPLICITLY AGREE NOT TO INVOKE ANY RIGHT OF RESCISSION AS A JUSTIFICATION TO SEEK CANCELATION OF THIS AGREEMENT AND/OR THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT WITH SELLER.

### 6.2 Remitting Payment

You agree to promptly remit payment of the Domain Purchase Price upon receipt of instructions from Sedo. You agree that Sedo, at its sole discretion, shall determine whether to accept payment in any currency other than the Contract Currency (as per Section 8 below of this Agreement) and that you are not entitled to demand to remit payment in a specific currency, or apply a specific exchange rate.

In cases where payment is made to a bank account specified by Sedo, the Purchase Price will be paid to Seller only after Successful Transfer. Sedo reserves the right to apply the payment, or any part thereof, to any outstanding obligations you owe to Sedo before applying payment to the Purchase Price. You acknowledge that failure to remit sufficient funds to cover any outstanding obligations you owe to Sedo and the Purchase Price is not grounds to release you from any obligations of the Purchase and Sale Agreement.

If you require an invoice or tax information (such as a form W-9) related to the Purchase and Sale Agreement, you shall inform Sedo of this requirement prior to remitting payment. Sedo shall communicate the request to the Seller as Sedo is not a party to the Purchase and Sale Agreement and cannot furnish those documents. You agree that you shall not portray Sedo as the Seller of the Domain to any third party. Failure to receive these documents subsequent to remitting payment shall not be grounds to release you from any of your obligations in this Agreement.

### 6.3 Transferring the Domain

You agree to cooperate with all of Sedo’s instructions regarding the technical transfer of the Domain registration. In addition to being a material breach of this Agreement, failure to cooperate may be considered by the Seller as a material breach of the underlying Purchase and Sale Agreement.

Should you not respond to Sedo's instructions within a period of time as clearly communicated by Sedo, Sedo may, at its sole discretion, transfer the registration of the Domain on your behalf to a registrant account in your name without your further cooperation (“Quick Transfer”). In the case of a Quick Transfer, you authorize Sedo to create a domain registrant account on your behalf. including agreeing to the registrar’s terms of use on your behalf and providing that registrar with the contact information in your Sedo User Account. In such an event, you consent to Sedo’s transmission and use of your personal data for this limited purpose. You further authorize Sedo to take any actions deemed necessary to receive the Domain registration in that account and agree to reimburse any fees incurred by Sedo to receive the Domain registration in this account. Once the Domain is received in this account, Sedo shall be authorized to deem the transfer of the registration to you as a Successful Transfer with regard to you and you cannot claim that Sedo has not performed its duties under this Agreement based solely on the fact that the Domain is not at your preferred domain registrar. Likewise, once the Domain is received in this account you cannot claim that you do not have control of the domain for reasons related to your inability to utilize the registrar tools to update the domain registration information or hosting servers for the Domain. You acknowledge that the registrar may charge you fees in the future to maintain the registration and you agree that Sedo shall have no responsibility to ensure the registration is maintained or to support you in transferring the Domain to a different registrar.

Once the initial transfer of the Domain is complete, you acknowledge that you are free to change the registrar for the transferred Domain at your own expense subject to the policies of the initial registrar and acknowledge that those may include policies, such as a 60-day lock, that limit your ability to further transfer the Domain until a period of time has elapsed. You also acknowledge that assistance with any further transfers of the Domain are not part of the Domain Transfer Service and that Sedo is also not obliged to extend the Service for such purposes.

If Sedo, at its sole discretion, assumes temporary control of the Domain, you agree to take over technical control of the Domain promptly when instructed to do so by Sedo and to update the WHOIS information accordingly. Sedo shall not be held responsible for maintaining the Domain and if you do not take over technical control of the Domain within sixty (60) days after Sedo took over temporary control of the Domain, it is in Sedo’s discretion not to extend the Domain registration period. This may result in the lapse or expiration of the Domain and you agree to hold Sedo harmless and will not be compensated for this loss.

You agree to promptly confirm or deny your control of the Domain upon receipt of such an inquiry from Sedo. Sedo shall be authorized to deem the transfer of registration to you complete should Sedo not receive a response within five (5 days). In this case, Sedo is entitled to consider the transfer of the registration as a Successful Transfer, whereupon you can no longer claim that Sedo has not fulfilled its obligations under this Agreement should you not have technical control over the Domain.

Once you have assumed control of the domain you are obligated to immediately update the domain’s WHOIS record with its respective registrar. You agree to indemnify Sedo and/or the Seller for any damages or costs incurred due to your failure to update the domain’s WHOIS record.

### 6.4 Transfer Failure and Repayment

You acknowledge that a Failed Transfer, for any reason, does not automatically release you from the Purchase and Sale Agreement.

If designated by Sedo as a Failed Transfer for reasons unrelated to you and you have remitted payment pursuant to Section 6.2 of this Agreement, the party you paid shall be responsible for returning the full payment of the Domain’s Purchase Price.

If the Failed Transfer is ultimately unsuccessful solely due to the fact that you have not undertaken to follow the instructions provided by Sedo, there will be no responsibility on any party to return to you the full payment of the Domain’s Purchase Price, or where applicable, any fees paid to Sedo.

In the case of a Failed Transfer, you cannot claim any breach of duty on the part of Sedo based solely on the fact that the domain has not been transferred to you but rather returned to the Seller.

### 7\. Rights and Duties of Domain Seller

### 7.1 Reaching an Agreement

Sedo reserves the right to deduct any outstanding obligations you owe to Sedo from that payment. You acknowledge that not receiving a payment of the exact amount of the Purchase Price is not grounds for a breach of the Purchase and Sale Agreement by the Buyer.

### 7.3 Transferring the Domain

In the event that you do not cooperate with Sedo’s instructions, Sedo shall be authorized, at its sole discretion, to either hold the Domain on your behalf and deduct any portion of the Purchase Price you have not returned to Sedo from any other amounts owed to you by Sedo, or to resell the Domain to another Buyer to recoup Sedo’s losses.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sedo reserves the right to recover from Customer any and all damages resulting from breaches of this Domain Transfer Service Agreement, the Domain Marketplace Agreement, the Domain Brokerage Agreement, and/or User Terms.

### 8\. Fees and Related Costs

The Domain Transfer Service is provided for free to Buyers and Sellers conducting a purchase and sale via Sedo's Domain Marketplace or in conjunction with Sedo’s Domain Brokerage Service. For Users who wish to order the Domain Transfer Service for other transactions, the amount of the fee for the Domain Transfer Service is specified on the Sedo [Price List](https://sedo.com/us/what-we-offer/price-list/), which is located on the Website and subject to change from time to time.

The responsibilities for these payment obligations are defined by the relationship of the Buyer or Seller to the provider. This can include, but is not limited to, the responsibility of the Seller to pay for a registration renewal when the domain is set to expire within sixty (60) days from the date the Domain Transfer Service is initiated. Buyer and Seller agree to reimburse Sedo for any fees that may be charged by the registrar to Sedo while effecting a Quick Transfer or temporarily holding the Domain pursuant to Section 5.3 of this Agreement.

Any liability of Sedo for damages resulting from the failure of the transaction process is excluded, unless such damages are based on intentional or grossly negligent conduct of Sedo, its representatives or vicarious agents.

This exclusion includes, but is not limited to, instances where one of the contracting parties refuses to properly complete the transaction documents, otherwise obstructs the execution of the transaction, or in which one of the contracting parties cannot be identified due to false or misleading information.

In all other respects, Customer shall indemnify and hold Sedo harmless from and against any and all claims for damages, liability, warnings, injunctive relief from third parties, and other claims and expenses in connection therewith arising out of any violation of any prior rights of third parties or any other provision of these Domain Transfer Service Terms and Conditions or the law.

In all other respects, the liability provisions of Sedo's General Terms and Conditions shall apply, provided that they have not been modified by the provisions of this section of these Domain Transfer Service Terms and Conditions.

### 10\. Exclusion of warranty and guarantee

Sedo is dedicated exclusively to the secured transfer of a domain name after a Purchase and Sale Agreement has been reached between Buyer and Seller. Sedo is not the seller, and as such, maintains no duty to verify that the domain name and/or website content being sold and transferred do not violate the priority rights of any third parties or any statutory law or that the Seller is authorized to sell the domain name, and thus makes no warranties as to the existence of conflicting priority rights of any third parties. Buyer and Seller agree that the Domain Transfer Service does not include an examination or verification of the existence of any conflicting priority firm name, naming or trademark rights, or other rights of third parties and failure to perform in advance an examination of the domain name and/or website content for the existence of conflicting rights, including, but not limited to, priority ownership rights, trademark rights, and/or violation of applicable law, is the sole responsibility of the buyer and seller.

Any liability of Sedo towards the parties for damages resulting from the sale or purchase of domain names or website content is excluded, unless such damages are based on intentional or grossly negligent conduct of Sedo, its representatives or vicarious agents. Rather, the infringing party indemnifies Sedo against all claims for damages, liability, warning letters, cease-and-desist declarations by third parties and other claims, as well as any costs and expenses in connection therewith, which have been caused by the causative conduct (including omission) of the infringing party.

Buyers and Sellers using the Domain Transfer Service acknowledge that the trade of domain names, with or without associated website content, or the use of domain names, which violate company, name, trademark or other rights of third parties or statutory laws, may be subject to legal claims from an owner of a respective right and that such a rights holder may seek injunctive relief to seek control of the domain name. In such instances it may not be possible for a Buyer to reclaim a purchase price that has already been paid to Seller. Buyer is solely responsible for the performance of any and all research necessary to determine the risks related to their purchase and use of a domain name prior to the conclusion of a Purchase and Sale Agreement.
