Stolen Domain Policy
====================

Along with protecting intellectual property rights, Sedo is committed to protecting domain ownership rights, whether those of our users, third parties, or our own. Because we are in the business of buying, selling, and auctioning domains, valid domain ownership is a crucial part of our business. Respecting such ownership is necessary and we will not tolerate actions of domain theft and/or hijacking. Sedo created the Stolen Domain Procedure so domain owners could easily report activity that causes an interruption in their ownership rights. Please use the links below to learn more about Sedo’s efforts to protect domain ownership rights.

What is Domain Hijacking?
-------------------------

Domain hijacking is an aggressive form of domain theft whereby a hijacker uses fraud or another form of improper means to change the registration information of an unexpired domain with the purpose of illegally taking control over the domain from its legitimate owner.

Domains Owned by Sedo.com
-------------------------

Outside of a few domains used for marketing purposes as well as those corresponding to our own trademarks, Sedo does not own or maintain control of ANY domains. Sedo’s agreement with our users explicitly stipulates that the user is the domain registrant/owner of record. Furthermore, Sedo.com will not tolerate behavior consistent with stolen or hijacked domains from third parties or from users.

Reporting a Stolen Domain/ Stolen Domain Procedure
--------------------------------------------------

If you feel that one of the domains parked or listed for sale with Sedo has been hijacked from you, please comply with the following complaint procedure. In order to process your claim, please email in PDF format to [\[email protected\]](https://sedo.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)

* When you originally registered the domain;
* When you last registered or renewed the domain;
* When you last had the domain under your control;
* When you found out it had been stolen from you;
* Whether or not you know or can name the person who is now in control of the domain;
* The statement: “I have a good faith belief that the domain in question has been unlawfully removed from my control and the current registrant obtained the domain through fraudulent means.”
* The statement: “I have either initiated a legal action with my local police or a currently unresolved complaint with the domain’s registrar to recover the domain.”
* Once Sedo has received your complaint, an investigation will commence and you will be informed of the outcome within five business days.
