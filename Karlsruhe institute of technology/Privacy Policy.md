Privacy Policy
==============

Stand: 22.06.2021

The Privacy Friendly Apps are designed to function with minimized data disclosure, in line with Article 5(1)(c) of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) does not collect any personal data via the Privacy Friendly Apps. Specific functions of certain apps may involve the processing of personal data:

**Weather (Privacy Friendly):**

The app retrieves weather data via the free API of OpenWeatherMap ([https://openweathermap.org/api](https://openweathermap.org/api)). OpenWeatherMap provides information on data protection at [https://openweather.co.uk/privacy-policy](https://openweather.co.uk/privacy-policy).

**Net Monitor (Privacy Friendly):**

For certificate verification (analysis of TLS implementation), a connection is established via the SSL Labs API ([https://www.ssllabs.com/projects/ssllabs-apis/](https://www.ssllabs.com/projects/ssllabs-apis/)). The operator Qualys provides information on data protection at [https://www.qualys.com/company/privacy/](https://www.qualys.com/company/privacy/) including a supplementary EEA Supplement Privacy Policy, which is intended as special information for data sub-jects in the European Economic Area.

**Food-Tracker (Privacy Friendly):**

In order to be able to provide information about products (such as calorie count and name), products are retrieved from the Open Food Facts database ([https://world.openfoodfacts.org/](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/)) at the user's request. However, if the functionality is not desired or needed, the app will work without this permission.

Questions and suggestions regarding the Privacy Friendly Apps can be sent to us via the e-mail address [contact∂secuso.org](mailto:contact@secuso.org). To respond to inquiries, we process your personal data as follows:

Recipients of the data are the employees of the SECUSO research group at KIT. Employees from the organizational units of the central administration of KIT are only consulted if it is necessary to respond to the inquiry. We delete the personal data collected in this context after the storage is no longer necessary or restrict the processing if there are legal retention obligations.
