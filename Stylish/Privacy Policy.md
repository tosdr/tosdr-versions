Stylish Privacy Policy
======================

Last Modified: May 30, 2024
---------------------------

  

We are Similarweb and this is our privacy policy for our Stylish product and service. If you have read privacy policies before, you may have found that they are difficult to understand and often overwhelm you with information. As such, we will try to keep this simple and get to the bottom line right away: **We do not want to know your identity and we do not automatically collect data to try and figure out who you are**. Of course, we need to give you all of the regular privacy policy information to which you are entitled, and we will get to that in a minute. But first, and in case you do not have the time or patience to read through the whole policy, we want to repeat and make that point perfectly clear: We do not **want to know your identity** - unless you decide to share it by registering on our website or contacting us for support, in which case we will use it **only for that purpose.**  
  
In the rest of this privacy policy, we are going to give you a lot of detail about exactly what data is collected from you, how it is processed, where it is stored, and what your rights are as a user. That is important information, and we certainly hope you carefully read the entire policy. As a user of a product from which data is processed, you are entitled to that information and we are obligated to make it available. That makes sense and is as it should be since you deserve to be protected from intrusive data practices. Compliance with data privacy laws and regulations, including the GDPR, is extremely important to us and is a top priority in our activities as a global company.  
  
Sure, we do collect information from you when you use our product. The information is collected using code that is open-source and which can be inspected by anyone capable of doing so. We realize that most users may not be able to read that code, but the point is, the purpose of that data collection is to provide you with the best Stylish product and service we can. We have no interest in knowing the identity of any individual users, and we invest enormous resources to ensure that we are not able to do so(for example, we use an algorithm designed to remove from collected browser data any personal information that may have been inadvertently included in it). We also delete from IP addresses the portion that provides specific geolocation information.  
  
If you got this far, we hope you will continue and read the rest of this policy. Either way, if you decide to use our Stylish product or services and have any questions about your rights as a user, feel free to contact us at [support@userstyles.org](mailto:support@userstyles.org,),  
  
As data protection is important to us, we have engaged an external data privacy expert to serve as our Data Protection Officer. If you have any questions regarding this policy or your data privacy rights, you are welcome to contact our Data Protection Officer at:

**Information We Collect From Stylish Extension Users and your opt-out options**  
This information is processed if you install and use our Stylish browser extension:  

| **Type of Information** | **How We Use It** | **Opt Out** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Standard web server log information (i.e., page views). In order to avoid receiving and processing any Personal Information, we use an advanced cleaning algorithm designed to filter from browsing data any information that could be used to determine the identity of a user. | We use this information to support and enable the Stylish services (i.e., to understand how popular websites are in order for us to determine which websites, and which sections within each website, we would want to build and support Web Styles).  <br>  <br>We may also use this information for market intelligence purposes and to develop insights-based products and services, which we then may provide to our clients and customers. We will use this information for this purpose when you provide us with your consent for us to do so, if we are required to under applicable law. | Right click on the extension icon, select 'Options', and uncheck the box that says "Send de-identified browsing data to Stylish to access style suggestions through the toolbar menu" and/or uncheck the box that says "Send de- identified SERP data to Stylish to access style suggestions on search results" and/or uncheck the box that says "Show number of styles active for the current site on the toolbar button" and/or uncheck the box that says "Send feedback in the format of usage analytics to help us improve Stylish".  <br>  <br>Note that once you opt out, part of the Services provided by the Stylish browser extension will no longer be available, meaning "Suggested Web Styles" won't be available in the browser extension interface, and "Suggested Web Styles" won’t be available in the context menu. |
| Non-personal Technical information such as your interaction with the extension (e.g., installed Styles),browser type, operating system, device model name, device screen size, time and date.

Meaning, we are only interested in the input and output terms or results of your interaction with the AI tools. Considering the nature and general scope of input and output that is typical to AI tools, some sensitive personal data may be inadvertently processed in the provision of our Services. However, the aim of the processing is not the collection of any Personal Data or data that could identify you. While we cannot guarantee that all personal data is removed, we do take steps to remove or filter out identifiers and personal data that you may enter or submit to these tools. | We use the AI inputs and outputs to provide the Services. Further, we use the AI inputs and outputs in an aggregated, filtered and de-identified manner so that such use is unable to identify you or another individual. For the purpose of providing the Service as set forth in the Terms, the AI inputs and outputs is processed for contract necessity. Otherwise, the secondary use of the de-identified, filtered, anonymized and aggregated AI inputs and outputs, is carried out based on your consent, where such consent is required by applicable laws. To the extent sensitive personal data is inadvertently processed, such data will be processed on the basis of your explicit consent, where required by applicable law. | You can withdraw your consent at any time as detailed below through the opt-out options.

PRIVACY INFORMATION FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS  
In this section, we provide information for California residents, as required under the California privacy laws, including the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which requires that we provide California residents certain specific information about how we handle their personal information, whether collected online or offline. Under the CCPA, “personal information” is any information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular California resident or household. It does not include publicly available data as defined by the CCPA. This section does not address or apply to our handling of publicly available information made lawfully available by state or federal governments or other personal information that is subject to an exemption under Section 1798.145(c) – (f) of the CCPA.  
  
Except for the right to opt-out and the right of non-discrimination, this section does not apply to California residents with whom we transact or communicate solely in the context of providing or receiving a product or service to or from a company that employs such residents or engages such residents as contractors.

CATEGORIES OF PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT, DISCLOSE, AND SELL  
The CCPA defines “sale” as disclosing or making available Personal Information to a third-party in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration, and “sharing” includes disclosing or making available Personal Information to a third-party for purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising. We may “sell” or “share” the following categories of Personal Information: Identifiers, commercial information, internet and electronic network activity information, profiles and inferences, and sensitive personal information, as described above. We may “sell” or “share” these categories to business customers so that our business customers may better understand consumer behavior and analyze and improve their marketing and advertising campaigns.  
  
We do not sell or share personal information about individuals who we know are under age sixteen (16).
