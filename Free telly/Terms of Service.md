These Terms of Use (the “Terms”) are a binding contract between you and TELLY, INC. (“Telly,” “we” and “us”).

These Terms include the provisions in this document as well as those in the Privacy Policy www.freetelly.com, any other relevant policies and any other accompanying terms and conditions of sale entered into between you and us for the sale of any Products.

Please read these Terms carefully. They cover important information about Services provided to you. These Terms include information about future changes to these Terms, limitations of liability, a class action waiver and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.

Will these Terms ever change?
=============================

We are constantly trying to improve our Products and Services, so these Terms may need to change along with our Products and Services. We reserve the right to change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will place a notice on our site located at freetelly.com. If we think the changes are material, we may send you an email, and/or notify you by some other means.

If you don’t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the Services. If you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, that means you understand and agree to all of the changes.

Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you and us.

What about my privacy?

What are my rights in the Services?
===================================

The materials displayed or performed or available on or through the Services, including, but not limited to, text, graphics, data, articles, photos, images, illustrations and so forth (all of the foregoing, the “Content”) are protected by copyright and/or other intellectual property laws. You promise to abide by all copyright notices, trademark rules, information, and restrictions contained in any Content you access through the Services, and you won’t use, copy, reproduce, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, upload, display, license, sell, commercialize or otherwise exploit for any purpose any Content not owned by you, (i) without the prior consent of the owner of that Content or (ii) in a way that violates someone else’s (including Telly's) rights.

Subject to these Terms, we grant each user of the Services a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable and non-transferable license to use (i.e., to download and display locally) Content solely for purposes of using the Services. Use, reproduction, modification, distribution or storage of any Content for any purpose other than using the Services is expressly prohibited without prior written permission from us. You understand that Telly owns the Services. You won’t modify, publish, transmit, participate in the transfer or sale of, reproduce (except as expressly provided in this Section), create derivative works based on, or otherwise exploit any of the Services. The Services may allow you to copy or download certain Content, but please remember that even where these functionalities exist, all the restrictions in this section still apply.

Who is responsible for what I see and do on the Services?
=========================================================

Any information or Content publicly posted or privately transmitted through the Services is the sole responsibility of the person from whom such Content originated, and you access all such information and Content at your own risk, and we aren’t liable for any errors or omissions in that information or Content or for any damages or loss you might suffer in connection with it. We cannot control and have no duty to take any action regarding how you may interpret and use the Content or what actions you may take as a result of having been exposed to the Content, and you hereby release us from all liability for you having acquired or not acquired Content through the Services.

The Services may contain links or connections to third-party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by Telly. When you access third-party websites or use third-party services, you accept that there are risks in doing so, and that Telly is not responsible for such risks.

Telly has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, accuracy, privacy policies, or practices of or opinions expressed in any third-party services or by any third party that you interact with through the Services. In addition, Telly will not and cannot monitor, verify, censor or edit the content of any third-party site or service. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Services and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third-party website or service that you visit or utilize. By using the Services, you release and hold us harmless from any and all liability arising from your use of any third-party website or service.

Your interactions with organizations and/or individuals found on or through the Services, including payment and delivery of goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such organizations and/or individuals. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any of these third parties. You agree that Telly shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings.

If there is a dispute between participants on this site or Services, or between users and any third party, you agree that Telly is under no obligation to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users, you release Telly, its directors, officers, employees, agents, and successors from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or our Services. You shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542 or any similar law of any jurisdiction, which says in substance: “A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.”

Will Telly ever change the Services?
====================================

We’re always trying to improve our Products and Services, so they may change over time. We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services. We reserve the right to remove any Content from the Services at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, if someone alleges you contributed that Content in violation of these Terms), in our sole discretion, and without notice.

Do the Services cost anything?
==============================

The Telly Device is free for consumers. Services are also currently free, but we reserve the right to charge for premium services in the future. We will notify you before any Services you are then using begin carrying a fee, and if you wish to continue using such Services, you must pay all applicable fees for such Services.

What if I want to stop using the Services?
==========================================

You’re free to do that at any time by contacting us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.freetelly.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection); please refer to our Privacy Policy www.freetelly.com as well as the licenses above, to understand how we treat information you provide to us after you have stopped using our Services.

Telly is also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of the Services or your account for any reason in our discretion, including your breach of these Terms. Telly has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions set forth in these Terms.

We will provide you with reasonable notice of any change, suspension, or discontinuation of our Services, unless it is urgently required, in which case we will notify you at the same time as the change, suspension, or discontinuation. To the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law, we will not be liable to you or to any third party if we exercise such rights.

If you stop using the Services, or if Telly terminates your use of the Services, you are required to return all Products and Services to Telly.

Account termination may result in destruction of any Content associated with your account, so keep that in mind before you decide to terminate your account.

If you have deleted your account by mistake, contact us immediately at [\[email protected\]](https://www.freetelly.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) – we will try to help, but unfortunately, we can’t promise that we can recover or restore anything.

Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Terms shall survive termination. By way of example, all of the following will survive termination: any obligation you have to indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us, including without limitation the arbitration agreement.

What about Mobile Applications?
===============================

You acknowledge and agree that the availability of our mobile application is dependent on the third party stores from which you download the application, e.g., the App Store from Apple or the Android app market from Google (each an “App Store”). Each App Store may have its own terms and conditions to which you must agree before downloading mobile applications from such store, including the specific terms relating to Apple App Store set forth below. You agree to comply with, and your license to use our application is conditioned upon your compliance with, such App Store terms and conditions. To the extent such other terms and conditions from such App Store are less restrictive than, or otherwise conflict with, the terms and conditions of these Terms of Use, the more restrictive or conflicting terms and conditions in these Terms of Use apply.

I use the Telly App available via the Apple and Android App Stores – should I know anything about that?
=======================================================================================================

These Terms apply to your use of all the Services, including our iOS and Android applications (the “Application”) available via the Apple, Inc. (“Apple”) App Store and Google Play (“Google Play”) Store, but the following additional terms also apply to the Application:

(a) Both you and Telly acknowledge that the Terms are concluded between you and Telly only, and not with Apple or Google Play, and that Apple and Google Play are not responsible for the Application or the Content;

(b) The Application is licensed to you on a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferrable, non-sublicensable basis, solely to be used in connection with the Services for your private, personal, non-commercial use, subject to all the terms and conditions of these Terms as they are applicable to the Services;

(c) You will only use the Application in connection with an Apple or Android device that you own or control;

(d) You acknowledge and agree that Apple and Google Play have no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the Application;

(e) In the event of any failure of the Application to conform to any applicable warranty, including those implied by law, you may notify Apple or Google Play of such failure; upon notification, Apple’s or Google Play’s sole warranty obligation to you will be to refund to you the purchase price, if any, of the Application;

(f) You acknowledge and agree that Telly, and not Apple or Google Play, is responsible for addressing any claims you or any third party may have in relation to the Application;

(g) You acknowledge and agree that, in the event of any third-party claim that the Application or your possession and use of the Application infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, Telly, and not Apple or Google Play, will be responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such infringement claim;

(h) You represent and warrant that you are not located in a country subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country, and that you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties;

(i) Both you and Telly acknowledge and agree that, in your use of the Application, you will comply with any applicable third-party terms of agreement which may affect or be affected by such use; and

(j) Both you and Telly acknowledge and agree that Apple, Google Play, and Apple’s and Google Play’s subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these Terms, Apple and Google Play will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the third-party beneficiaries hereof.

What else do I need to know?
============================

**_Not for Resale._**  Telly is only available in the United States.  Unless otherwise agreed by Telly, you may not resell the Services.

**_Warranty Disclaimer._** Telly and its licensors, suppliers, partners, parent, subsidiaries or affiliated entities, and each of their respective officers, directors, members, employees, consultants, contract employees, representatives and agents, and each of their respective successors and assigns (Telly and all such parties together, the “Telly Parties”) make no representations or warranties concerning the Services, including without limitation regarding any Content contained in or accessed through the Services or any Products, and the Telly Parties will not be responsible or liable for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of material contained in or accessed through the Services or any claims, actions, suits procedures, costs, expenses, damages or liabilities arising out of use of, or in any way related to your participation in, the Services. The Telly Parties make no representations or warranties regarding suggestions or recommendations of services or products offered or purchased through or in connection with the Services including, without limitation, any Products. Except as explicitly set forth in the previous paragraph, Products and services purchased or offered (whether or not following such recommendations and suggestions) through the Services are provided “AS-IS” and without any warranty of any kind from the Telly Parties or others (unless, with respect to such others only, provided expressly and unambiguously in writing by a designated third party for a specific product). THE SERVICES AND CONTENT ARE PROVIDED BY TELLY (AND ITS LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS) ON AN “AS-IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THAT USE OF THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. We are evaluating future warranty policies and will update our terms of service accordingly.

**_Accessibility._**  We work to fulfill the digital accessibility requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the 21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act (CVAA). However, because this is a Beta program, it is possible that not all accessibility features have been implemented at this time.  To promote accessibility, we have taken the following actions:

• We maintain and provide accessibility features in our products.

• We have initiated internal corporate training on product and web accessibility.

• We have hired experts in web accessibility to conduct audits and user testing, monitor our website, and help us develop a plan to ensure our digital offerings meet best practices in accessibility.

• We will continually review our products and website with best practices in accessibility.

We welcome feedback on how to improve the accessibility of our site and our products for all users.

‍

**_Limitation of Liability._** TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, TORT, CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE) SHALL ANY OF THE TELLY PARTIES BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY OTHER PERSON FOR (A) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, ACCURACY OF RESULTS, OR COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, (B) ANY SUBSTITUTE GOODS, SERVICES OR TECHNOLOGY, (C) ANY AMOUNT, IN THE AGGREGATE, IN EXCESS OF ONE-HUNDRED ($100) DOLLARS OR (D) ANY MATTER BEYOND OUR REASONABLE CONTROL. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL OR CERTAIN OTHER DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

‍

**_Indemnity._** You agree to indemnify and hold the Telly Parties harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages (actual and consequential), losses and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) arising from or in any way related to any claims relating to (a) your use of the Services (including any actions taken by a third party using your account)and any Products, and (b) your violation of these Terms. In the event of such a claim, suit, or action (“Claim”), we will attempt to provide notice of the Claim to the contact information we have for your account (provided that failure to deliver such notice shall not eliminate or reduce your indemnification obligations hereunder).

‍

**_Assignment._** You may not assign, delegate or transfer these Terms or your rights or obligations hereunder, or your Services account, in any way (by operation of law or otherwise) without Telly's prior written consent. We may transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights and obligations without consent.

‍

**_Choice of Law._** These Terms are governed by and will be construed under the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the State of California, without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.

‍

**_Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) Obligations._** The Product is subject to FCC regulation as an electronic device that is both an intentional and unintentional radiator of radiofrequency emissions. The commercial product will not ship until it completes the FCC equipment authorization process. Telly prohibits changes or modifications to the Product. Unauthorized changes or modifications will void Your authority to operate the Product, and may subject You to an FCC inquiry and possible enforcement action.

‍

**_Availability:_** You have agreed to join Telly’s waitlist for the Product when it becomes available. Joining Telly’s waitlist does not guarantee that You will receive a Product, for which quantities may be limited. Telly reserves the right to modify the queue for the Product as deemed appropriate in its sole discretion.

‍

**_Valid Credit Card Required:_** You will need to provide Telly with a valid credit card prior to shipment of the Product and periodically update Your credit card information to ensure it remains current in Telly’s records.

‍

**_ARBITRATION AGREEMENT._** Please read the following ARBITRATION AGREEMENT carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Telly and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from Telly. Both you and Telly acknowledge and agree that for the purposes of any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms, Telly's officers, directors, employees and independent contractors (“Personnel”) are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these Terms, Personnel will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the third-party beneficiary hereof.

‍

(a) Arbitration Rules; Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms directly through good-faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to either party initiating arbitration. If such negotiations do not resolve the dispute, then, notwithstanding section (c), “Small Claims Court; Infringement,” ALL DISPUTES WITH TELLY ARISING IN ANY WAY FROM THESE TERMS SHALL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION IN LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, AND NOT BE A COURT OR JURY.. The arbitration will proceed in the English language, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “Rules”) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes. The arbitrator shall be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with such Rules. Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

(b) Costs of Arbitration. The Rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. Telly will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than seventy-five thousand ($75,000) dollars. Telly will not seek its attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.

(c) Small Claims Court; Infringement. Either you or Telly may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in Los Angeles, California or any United States county where you live or work. Furthermore, notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction, to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.

(d) Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND TELLY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR JURY. You and Telly are instead choosing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In any litigation between you and Telly over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND TELLY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.

(e) _Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions._ ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor Telly is entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in (g) below.

(f) _Opt-out._ You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Section by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: [\[email protected\]](https://www.freetelly.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) within thirty (30) days of first accepting these Terms. You must include (i) your name and residence address, (ii) the email address and/or telephone number associated with your account, and (iii) a clear statement that you want to opt out of these Terms’ arbitration agreement.

(g) _Exclusive Venue_. If you send the opt-out notice in (f), and/or in any circumstances where the foregoing arbitration agreement permits either you or Telly to litigate any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms in court, then the foregoing arbitration agreement will not apply to either party, and both you and Telly agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the state or federal courts located in, respectively, Los Angeles, California, or the federal district in which that county falls.

(h) _Severability._ If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration Agreement section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Telly.

**_Miscellaneous._** You will be responsible for paying, withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection with the Services, provided that the Telly may, in its sole discretion, do any of the foregoing on your behalf or for itself as it sees fit. The failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. If any provision of these Terms are found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. You and Telly agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and Telly, and that these Terms supersede and cancel all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms. You hereby acknowledge and agree that you are not an employee, agent, partner, or joint venture of Telly, and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Telly in any respect whatsoever.

Except as expressly set forth in the sections above regarding the Apple Application and the arbitration agreement, you and Telly agree there are no third-party beneficiaries intended under these Terms.
