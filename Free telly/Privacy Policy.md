Any undefined terms in this Policy have the definitions given to them in the Telly Reservation Terms of Service.

The Telly Product Privacy Policy may vary depending upon the version of the Telly Device that you will receive, your state of residence, and other factors.

‍

As we continually work to improve our Services, we may need to change this Policy from time to time. We will alert you to any such changes by placing a notice on the Telly website, by sending you an email and/or by some other means. Please note that if you’ve opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven’t provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Telly Device, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. If you use your Telly Device after any changes to the Telly Product Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes.

‍

**Tracking Tools, Advertising and Opt-Out**

The Services use cookies and similar technologies such as pixel tags, web beacons, clear GIFs, mobile device identifiers and JavaScript (collectively, “Cookies”) to enable our (and our vendors’) servers to recognize your web browser or mobile device, tell us how and when you visit and use our Services, analyze trends, learn about our user base and operate and improve our Services. Cookies are small pieces of data– usually text files – placed on your computer, tablet, phone or similar device when you use that device to access our Services. We may also supplement the information we collect from you with information received from third parties, including third parties that have placed their own Cookies on your device(s). Please note that because the effect of “Do Not Track” signals remains unclear, and there continues to be no consistent industry understanding of how to respond to such a signal, we do not alter our privacy practices when we detect a “Do Not Track” signal from your browser.

We use the following types of Cookies:

* Essential Cookies. Essential Cookies are required for providing you with features or Services that you have requested. For example, certain Cookies enable you to log into secure areas of our Services. Disabling these Cookies may make certain features and Services unavailable.
* Functional Cookies. Functional Cookies are used to record your choices and settings regarding our Services, maintain your preferences over time and recognize you when you return to our Services. These Cookies help us to size our content for you, greet you by name and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region).
* Performance/Analytical Cookies. Performance/Analytical Cookies allow us to understand how visitors use our Services. They do this by collecting information about the number of visitors to the Services, what pages visitors view on our Services and how long visitors are viewing pages on the Services. Performance/Analytical Cookies also help us measure the performance of our advertising campaigns in order to help us improve our campaigns and the Services’ content for those who engage with our advertising. For example, Google LLC (“Google”) uses cookies in connection with its Google Analytics Services. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Services is subject to the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. You have the option to opt-out of Google’s use of Cookies by visiting the Google advertising opt-out page at www.google.com/privacy\_ads.html or the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on at [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). 
* Retargeting/Advertising Cookies. Retargeting/Advertising Cookies collect data about your online activity and/or identify your interests so that we can provide advertising that we believe is relevant to you. For more information about this, please see the section below titled “Information about Interest-Based Advertisements.”

**3rd PARTY COOKIES**

The website contains both 1st party and 3rd party cookies. While certain cookies on this site may be both 3rd party and controlled by us, we do not control either the expiry (how long a cookie will remain on your computer) or the retention (how long the 3rd party will retain information) relating to the majority of cookies on this site which are both 3rd party and not controlled by us. We make no representations about these cookies. For more information about these cookies, please access the privacy policies of the parties which set the cookies from the links here.

**AVAILABLE COOKIE CHOICES**

Choice with respect to cookies comes in 3 forms:

* Browser controls – All modern browsers allow you to set preferences with respect to any particular cookie issuer or more generally by 1st or 3rd party.
* Opt-Out Controls – Many advertisers and adtech providers offer an Opt-Out function. If this is selected they still set or read a cookie, but the cookie is generally a placeholder to remember your choice as having opted out or is not used for interest-based advertising. It is generally of the form ID=OPT\_OUT and conveys no unique information.

Advertising industry opt outs include:

* US - [www.abotuads.info/choices](http://www.abotuads.info/choices)
* US - [www.networkadvertising.com/choices](http://www.networkadvertising.com/choices)

Please note that opt outs operate by placing a cookie on your device that is unique to the browser and device you use to opt out. They may not function properly if you have configured your browser to reject certain cookies. If you change browsers or devices, or delete the cookies on your device, you will need to opt out again. You also can set your browser to notify you when a cookie is being set and to block most cookies.

_Information about Interest-Based Advertisements:_ 

We may serve advertisements, and also allow third-party ad networks, including third-party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms, to serve advertisements through the Services. These advertisements may be targeted to users who fit certain general profile categories or display certain preferences or behaviors (“Interest-Based Ads”). Information for Interest-Based Ads (including Personal Data) may be provided to us by you, or derived from the usage patterns of particular users on the Services and/or Services of third parties. Such information may be gathered through tracking users’ activities across time and unaffiliated properties, including when you leave the Services. To accomplish this, we or our service providers may deliver Cookies, including a file (known as a “web beacon”) to you through the Services. These trackers enable advertising technology providers to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. These trackers allow advertising technology providers to view, edit or set their own Cookies on your browser, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. 

**Data Security** 

We seek to protect Personal Data from unauthorized access, use and disclosure using appropriate physical, technical, organizational, and administrative security measures based on the type of Personal Data and how we are processing that data. You should also help protect your data by appropriately selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism; limiting access to your computer or device and browser; and signing off after you have finished accessing your account. Although we work to protect the security of your account and other data that we hold in our records, please be aware that no method of transmitting data over the internet or storing data is completely secure.

**Data Retention**

We retain Personal Data about you for as long as you have an open account with us or as otherwise necessary to provide you with our Services or to perform our business or commercial purposes for collecting your Personal Data. When establishing a retention period for specific categories of data, we consider who we collected the data from, our need for the Personal Data, why we collected the Personal Data, and the sensitivity of the Personal Data. In some cases, we retain Personal Data for longer following the end of you having an open account or using our Services, if doing so is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or collect fees owed, or is otherwise permitted or required by applicable law, rule, or regulation. We may further retain information in an anonymous or aggregated form where that information would not identify you personally.

For example:

* We retain your profile information and credentials for as long as you have an account with us.
* We retain your device/IP data for as long as we need it to ensure that our systems are working appropriately, effectively, and efficiently.

**Personal Data of Children**

As noted in the Terms of Use, we do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Data about children under 18 years of age; if you are a child under the age of 18, please do not attempt to register for or otherwise use the Services or send us any Personal Data. If we learn we have collected Personal Data from a child under 18 years of age, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 18  years of age may have provided Personal Data to us, please contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.freetelly.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

You may submit a Valid Request using the following method:

* Email us at: [\[email protected\]](https://www.freetelly.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)
