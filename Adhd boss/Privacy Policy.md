Upon your first visit to ADHDBoss.com, ADHD Boss sends a “cookie” to your computer. A cookie is a piece of data that identifies you as a unique user. ADHD Boss uses cookies to improve the quality of our service and to understand our user base more. ADHD Boss does this by storing user preferences in cookies and by tracking user trends and patterns of how people use the ADHD Boss Services.

We require that all e-mails promoting ADHDBoss.com or its products are sent only to clients who have agreed to receive such messages.

ADHD Boss does not collect any unique information about you (such as your name, email address, etc.) except when you specifically and knowingly provide such information. For example, ADHD Boss DOES collect such information from those users registering as Community Users and/or User Editors. ADHD Boss notes and saves information such as time of day, browser type, browser language, and IP address with each query. That information is used to verify our records and to provide more relevant services to users. For example, ADHD Boss may use your IP address or browser language to determine which language to use when showing search results or advertisements.

**Links to Other Sites**
------------------------

The stories/sites displayed and/or linked to by the ADHDBoss.com Service are developed by people over whom ADHD Boss exercises no control. Other links are also on sites not controlled by ADHD Boss. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information. ADHD Boss encourages you to read the privacy policy of all web sites you visit. ADHD Boss may choose to exhibit its results in the form of a “URL redirecter.” When ADHD Boss uses a URL redirecter, if you click on a URL on a ADHD Boss page, information about the click is sent to ADHD Boss, and ADHD Boss in turn sends you to the site you clicked on. ADHD Boss uses this URL information to understand and improve the quality of ADHD Boss’s technology.
