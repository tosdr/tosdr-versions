Affiliate Disclosure
====================

**Last updated:** December 22nd, 2019

ADHD Boss is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to (“ADHD Boss” (amazon.com, or endless.com, MYHABIT.com, SmallParts.com, or AmazonWireless.com).

In other words, some of the links on this website contain affiliate ID’s.

This means that I may receive a commission **at no additional cost to you** when you purchase a product, or click on an advertisement associated with ADHD Boss.

I will almost always link to products that I have personally used, and have benefited from first-hand.

On occasion, I will link to a product that I have not yet used if I believe that it will add genuine value to your life.

I’ll normally only do this if I’m familiar with the brand or product line.

This works out to be a win-win for all. I will do my best to provide you with products that add legitimate value to your life, and you’ll also be able to support ADHDBoss.com at no additional cost to you.

Thank you for your support.
