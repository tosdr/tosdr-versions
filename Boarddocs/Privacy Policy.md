11\. Changes to the Policy

This Privacy Policy applies to our websites and online board management and corporate governance, risk, and compliance-related services and product offerings (as well as other interactions in relation to the foregoing, such as webinars and events that we may hold in connection with our business activities, as well as web-based resources we make available through our websites, such as our resource center, online training, community, and tools & templates).

Websites where this Privacy Policy applies include diligent.com, boardeffect.com, boarddocs.com, blueprintoneworld.com, cglytics.com, manzama.com, steeleglobal.com, transparint.com, compliancewave.com, wegalvanize.com, info4c.net and ospreycompliancesoftware.com.

Within this Privacy Policy, (i) our corporate governance, risk, and compliance-related services and product offerings are referred to as the “services” and (ii) our websites are referred to as the “websites”. The websites and the services are owned and operated by Diligent Corporation and its group companies listed [here](https://diligent.com/diligent-data-controllers) (collectively, “We”, “Us”, or “Our”). This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, disclose and secure the personal information you provide via the websites or the services. It also describes your choices regarding use, access and correction of your personal information.

Personal information is information, or a combination of different types of information, that could reasonably allow you to be identified. For example, an individual’s name, e-mail address, phone number, or photo is generally understood to be their personal information. Other data points, such as an IP address, may constitute personal information if the data point can be used to identify an individual. Information that has been anonymized, and from which no individual can be identified either directly or in combination with other data, is not personal information.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Privacy Policy does not supersede or replace any additional or supplementary requirements that may be present in our customer contracts.

The Privacy Policy Supplement related to info4c Products can be accessed [here](https://www.info4c.net/legal-information/data-privacy-policy/).

Diligent Corporation (“Diligent”) complies with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (EU-U.S. DPF), the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (Swiss-U.S. DPF) as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Diligent has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (EU-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from the European Union and the United Kingdom in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF. Diligent has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework Principles (Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles) with regard to the processing of personal data received from Switzerland in reliance on the Swiss-U.S. DPF. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the EU-U.S. DPF Principles and/or the Swiss-U.S. DPF Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Data Privacy Framework (DPF Program) and to view our certification, visit the US Department of Commerce’s Data Privacy Framework List: [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/).

In the context of an onward transfer, Diligent is responsible for the processing of personal data it receives, under each Data Privacy Framework, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. To the extent provided by the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, Diligent remains liable under each respective Data Privacy Framework if Diligent’s agent processes personal data in a manner inconsistent with such Data Privacy Framework, unless Diligent proves that it is not responsible for the matter giving rise to the damage.

With respect to personal data received or transferred under the Data Privacy Frameworks, Diligent is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, Diligent may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

In compliance with the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF, Diligent commits to cooperate and comply with the advice of the panel established by the EU data protection authorities (DPAs), the UK Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC), respectively, with regard to unresolved complaints concerning our handling of personal data received in reliance on the EU-U.S. DPF, the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF and the Swiss-U.S. DPF. Under certain conditions, described in more detail on the Data Privacy Framework website [here](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/article/How-to-Submit-a-Complaint-Relating-to-a-Participating-Organization-s-Compliance-with-the-DPF-Principles-dpf), you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.

As of the date of this Privacy Policy, Diligent does not rely on the Swiss-U.S. DPF as a data transfer mechanism in accordance with the laws of Switzerland. If and when the Swiss-U.S. DPF comes into effect however Diligent may rely on the Swiss-U.S. DPF as a data transfer mechanism for personal data received from Switzerland.
