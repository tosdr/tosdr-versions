Here the user chose Java and wrote code to recursively create a `LinkedList`.<br>* (2) Press ‘Visualize’ to run the code. This code ran for 46 steps, where each step is one executed line of code. Go to any step (2a) and see what line of code was being run at that step (2b).<br>* (3) See the frames of all functions/methods on the stack at this step, each of which shows its local variables. Here at step 41 we see `main()` along with 4 recursive calls to `init()`.<br>* (4) See all objects on the heap at the current step. Here it shows a `LinkedList` instance with `first` and `last` fields pointing to its first and last `Node` instances, respectively. Each `Node` has a numerical value and a `next` pointer.<br>* (5) See what has been printed up to this step. Here the print statement in the `Node` constructor (line 5) has run 3 times.<br><br>The user can navigate forwards and backwards through all execution steps, and the visualization changes to match the run-time state of the stack and heap at each step. In this example, the user would see their custom `LinkedList` data structure getting incrementally built up one Node at a time via recursive calls to `init()` until the base case is reached when `n==0`.<br><br>### Language Support<br><br>Despite its name, Python Tutor is also a widely-used [web-based visualizer for Java](https://pythontutor.com/articles/java-visualizer.html) that helps students to understand and debug their code. It visualizes the majority of object-oriented programming concepts taught in introductory college courses (e.g., CS1 and CS2), high school AP Computer Science, and intermediate-level Java programming.<br><br>Python Tutor is also a widely-used [web-based visualizer for C and C++](https://pythontutor.com/articles/c-cpp-visualizer.html) meant to help students in introductory and intermediate-level courses. It uses [Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/) to perform memory-safe run-time traversal of data structures, which lets it display data more accurately than gdb or printf debugging. For instance, it can precisely visualize critical concepts such as pointers, uninitialized memory, out-of-bounds errors, nested arrays/structs/unions, type punning, and bit manipulation.<br><br>Lastly, it also supports visualizing standalone JavaScript execution, but not web frontend code that does DOM manipulation on webpages.<br><br>### Unsupported Features<br><br>Recall that [Python Tutor](https://pythontutor.com/) is designed to imitate what an instructor in an introductory programming class draws on the blackboard:<br><br>![](articles/cs61b-blackboard.png)<br><br>Thus, it is meant to illustrate small pieces of self-contained code that runs for not too many steps. After all, an instructor can't write hundreds of lines of code, draw hundreds of data structures and pointers, or walk through hundreds of execution steps on the board! Also, code in introductory classes usually doesn't access external libraries. **If your code can't fit on a blackboard or presentation slide, it's probably too long to visualize effectively in Python Tutor.** This tool is not meant as a professional-level debugger.<br><br>Due to this ultra-focused design, the following features are not supported on purpose:<br><br>* Code that is too large in size<br>    * [shorten your code](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) to what fits on a blackboard or presentation slide<br>    * Python Tutor is **_not_** for debugging arbitrary code that you paste into it; you'll need to shorten your code to isolate what you want to debug<br>* Code that runs for too many steps (e.g., > 100) or for a long time (e.g., > 10 sec)<br>    * [shorten your code](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) to isolate exactly what operations you want to visualize<br>    * e.g., make your numbers/strings smaller, arrays/lists shorter, your data structures contain fewer items, and your loops/functions run fewer times<br>    * for Python, set breakpoints using special `#break` comments ([example](http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#code=%23%20%5Bofficial%20Python%20Tutor%20example%5D%0A%0A%23%20when%20the%20string%20%23break%20is%20the%20last%20thing%20on%20a%20line,%20then%20only%0A%23%20trace%20the%20execution%20of%20those%20lines.%20this%20can%20make%20it%20possible%20to%0A%23%20trace%20longer-running%20programs%20by%20stopping%20only%20at%20selected%20lines%0A%0A%23%20normally%20execution%20would%20halt%20after%201000%20steps,%20so%20you'd%20never%0A%23%20get%20to%20print%20everything%20...%20but%20if%20you%20put%20'%23break'%20on%20line%2012%0A%23%20then%20it%20will%20stop%20and%20print%20out%20all%20the%20desired%20numbers%0Afor%20i%20in%20range%2810000%29%3A%0A%20%20%20%20if%20i%20%3E%200%20and%20i%20%25%201000%20%3D%3D%200%3A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20print%28i%29%20%23break&cumulative=false&heapPrimitives=nevernest&mode=edit&origin=opt-frontend.js&py=3&rawInputLstJSON=%5B%5D&textReferences=false))<br>* Code that defines too many variables or objects<br>    * [shorten your code](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) to isolate what variables you want to visualize<br>    * remove unnecessary variables and objects from your code<br>    * for Python, use `#pythontutor_hide` to selectively hide objects ([example](http://pythontutor.com/visualize.html#code=%23%20%5Bofficial%20Python%20Tutor%20example%5D%0A%0A%23%20use%20'%23pythontutor_hide'%20to%20pass%20in%20a%20glob%20expression%0A%23%20%28https%3A//docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html%29%20for%20what%0A%23%20variable%20names%20to%20hide.%20in%20this%20example,%20'*Type'%20means%20hide%0A%23%20all%20variables%20that%20end%20with%20'Type'.%20'y*'%20means%20anything%20starting%20with%20'y'%0A%0A%23%20use%20'%23pythontutor_hide_type'%20to%20pass%20in%20names%20of%20types%20of%20objects%0A%23%20to%20hide.%20in%20this%20example,%20we%20hide%20all%20classes,%20functions,%20and%20tuples%0A%0A%23%20if%20you%20remove%20these%20comments%20below,%20you%20will%20see%20how%20the%20visualization%0A%23%20is%20overly%20complicated.%20using%20these%20can%20drastically%20reduce%20the%20number%0A%23%20of%20visualized%20objects%20to%20a%20manageable%20amount.%0A%0A%23pythontutor_hide%3A%20*Type,%20y*%0A%23pythontutor_hide_type%3A%20class,%20function,%20tuple%0A%0A%0Afrom%20types%20import%20*%20%23%20lots%20of%20stuff%20in%20here%20should%20be%20hidden%0A%0Adef%20func1%28%29%3A%0A%20%20%20%20pass%0Adef%20func2%28%29%3A%0A%20%20%20%20pass%0A%0Ax%20%3D%20%281,2,3%29%0A%23%20all%20the%20y's%20should%20be%20hidden%0Ay%20%3D%20list%28x%29%0Ay2%20%3D%20y%0Ay3%20%3D%20y%0Az%20%3D%20y%20%23%20'z'%20should%20be%20the%20only%20object%20shown%20in%20the%20visualization%20%3A%29&cumulative=false&heapPrimitives=nevernest&mode=edit&origin=opt-frontend.js&py=3&rawInputLstJSON=%5B%5D&textReferences=false))<br>    * also use “Move and hide objects” option at bottom-left of visualizer to hide<br>* Advanced language features or subtleties that only experts need to know about<br>* Importing most external libraries (it’s meant for learning basic coding concepts)<br>* Visualizing custom data structures from libraries (it supports only built-in types)<br>* Interfacing with files, databases, networking, or other external resources<br>* Anything involving GUI programming or manipulating GUI/webpage components<br>* Multi-threaded / concurrent / asynchronous code (only supports single-threaded)<br><br>Other general unsupported features:<br><br>* Command-line arguments (e.g., `argv[]`) not supported; use hard-coded strings instead<br>* Reading data from external files is not supported (workaround: use strings to emulate files.

Upgrading to the newest versions can confuse beginners who are learning from instructional materials since the compiler/interpreter messages do not match their materials.<br><br>For a detailed list of unsupported features for each programming language, view the [full documentation here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13_Bc-l2FKMgwPx4dZb0sv7eMfYMHhRVgBRShha8kgbU/).<br><br>### Reporting Bugs<br><br>The issue you’re encountering is [likely listed in this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13_Bc-l2FKMgwPx4dZb0sv7eMfYMHhRVgBRShha8kgbU/).
