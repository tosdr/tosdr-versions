THE MATERIALS, INFORMATION AND OPINIONS INCLUDED AND/OR EXPRESSED IN OR ON BULLETIN BOARDS, CHAT ROOMS, COMMUNITY PAGES OR OTHER FORUMS ON CHIVE MEDIA GROUP WEBSITES (“FORUMS”) ARE NOT NECESSARILY THOSE OF CHIVE MEDIA GROUP OR ITS AFFILIATED OR RELATED ENTITIES OR CONTENT PROVIDERS. CHIVE MEDIA GROUP DOES NOT UNDERTAKE TO MONITOR OR REVIEW FORUMS, AND THE CONTENT OF FORUMS IS NOT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF CHIVE MEDIA GROUP. CHIVE MEDIA GROUP MAY REMOVE OR MODIFY ANY CONTENT WITHOUT NOTICE OR LIABILITY AT ANY TIME IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION.  ANY USE OF THE FORUMS WILL BE AT YOUR OWN RISK AND WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY SET OUT ABOVE.

Indemnification

You acknowledge and agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by law, the entire risk arising out of your access to and use of any and all Websites, services and their content remains with you.  You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold Chive Media Group, Rarefied Atmosphere, its officers, directors, members, employees, affiliates, and agents, harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages losses, and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way connected with: (a) your access to or use of the Websites, User Submissions, Material, Forums or Content; (b) your User Submissions; (c) your violation of these Terms or any laws; (d) your violation of any third party right, including without limitation any IP rights or Personal Rights; or (e) any claim that your User Submissions caused damage to a third party.  This defense and indemnification obligation will survive these Rules and your use of the Websites.

Jurisdiction, Venue, and Severability

You agree that the Websites shall be deemed solely based in Texas, the Websites shall be deemed passive, and that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over Chive Media Group, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than Texas.  These Terms will be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of Texas, without respect to any conflict of laws principles.  Any and all disputes, claims and causes of action arising out of or connected with these Terms or the Websites will be resolved individually, without resort to any form of class action, and exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in Travis County, Texas, and the parties hereby consent to such venue and to the jurisdiction of such courts over such proceeding and themselves.

If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision will not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms, which will remain in full force and effect.  No waiver of any term of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Chive Media Group’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.  These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Chive Media Group without restriction.

Limitations Period

YOU AND CHIVE MEDIA GROUP AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SERVICE MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES.  OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.
