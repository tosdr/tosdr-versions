Blue Ant Media cannot confirm the price of an item until you order. Despite our best efforts, a small number of the items in our catalog may be mispriced. If an item’s correct price is higher than our stated price, we will, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before shipping or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation. We generally do not charge your credit card until after your order has entered the shipping process or, for digital products, until we make the digital product available to you.

Blue Ant Media attempts to be as accurate as possible. However, Blue Ant Media does not warrant that product descriptions are accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free.
