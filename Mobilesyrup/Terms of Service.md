### 7\. E-commerce Sales and Services

**a) Pricing**

Blue Ant Media cannot confirm the price of an item until you order. Despite our best efforts, a small number of the items in our catalog may be mispriced. If an item’s correct price is higher than our stated price, we will, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before shipping or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation. We generally do not charge your credit card until after your order has entered the shipping process or, for digital products, until we make the digital product available to you. Unless otherwise provided, prices are in Canadian currency.

**b) Product Descriptions**

Blue Ant Media attempts to be as accurate as possible. However, Blue Ant Media does not warrant that product descriptions are accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. If a product offered by Blue Ant Media itself is not as described, your sole remedy is to return it in unused condition.

These restrictions may include orders placed by or under the same customer account, the same credit card, and/or orders that use the same billing and/or shipping address. In the event we make a change to or cancel an order, we will attempt to notify you by contacting the e-mail and/or billing address/phone number provided at the time the order was made.
