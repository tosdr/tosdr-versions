We may provide you with the opportunity to create, submit, post, display, transmit, perform, publish, distribute, or broadcast content and materials to us or on the App, including but not limited to text, writings, video, audio, photographs, graphics, comments, or other material (collectively, "Contributions"). Contributions may be viewable by other users of the App. As such, any Contributions you transmit may be treated in accordance with the App Privacy Policy. When you create or make available any Contributions, you thereby represent and warrant that:

* The creation, distribution, transmission, public display, or performance, and the accessing, downloading, or copying of your Contributions do not and will not infringe the proprietary rights, including but not limited to the copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret, or moral rights of any third party.
* You are the creator and owner of or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, releases, and permissions to use and to authorize us, the App, and other users of the App to use your Contributions in any manner contemplated by the App and these Terms of Service.
* Your Contributions are not false, inaccurate, or misleading.

Your account may be deleted upon request. This will delete your account and any personal contact information associated with it. As Contributions are shared throughout the App, they will continue to exist and be accessible by other users via their own accounts, even after we have deleted your account. In order to permanently delete your Contributions so that they are no longer accessible to other users, you must manually delete each individual Contribution. A Contribution will be deleted from the accounts of other users and from the App only after you permanently delete that individual Contribution. Follow the instructions here to permanently delete one of your Contributions.

By submitting suggestions or other feedback regarding the App, you agree that we can use and share such feedback for any purpose without compensation to you.

We do not assert any ownership over your Contributions. You retain full ownership of all of your Contributions and any intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights associated with your Contributions.

You agree that your Contributions will comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) and will act promptly to remove any infringing material from the Service if you or WebCatalog receives a notice qualifying under the DMCA.

Dispute Resolution
------------------

### Informal Negotiations

To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Terms of Service (each a "Dispute" and collectively, the “Disputes”) brought by either you or us (individually, a “Party” and collectively, the “Parties”), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least 90 days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.

### Binding Arbitration

Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this contract, including any question regarding its existence, validity, or termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the AAA rules, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section. (The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org/arb\_med or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.

### Restrictions

The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.

### Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration

The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
