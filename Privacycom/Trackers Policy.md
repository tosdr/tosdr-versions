#### You Have Choices:

* Notifications: Our Services may ask you for permission to send notifications to your device. Our services will still work if you do not grant us permission to send you notifications.
* Do Not Track: Some browsers support a “Do Not Track” feature, which is intended to be a signal to websites that you do not wish to be tracked across different websites you visit. Our Services do not currently change the way they operate based upon detection of a Do Not Track or similar signal.

#### Cookies

We and our partners use cookies or similar technologies to offer an enhanced experience and Services to users who wish to allow them. These technologies help us analyze trends, administer the website, track traffic, and gather information about users. For information on how to block cookies, see below.

We use cookies to track preferences and settings (e.g., so we can remember your preferences, like whether you’ve selected a “do not display banners” option), for sign in and authentication (e.g., so you don’t have to sign in each time you return to the site, or sign in again whenever you move to a new webpage), and for analytics purposes (e.g., to count page visitors or obtain statistics about our Services’ operations that help us improve our website and Services). We may use cookies from third-party providers.

##### How to Control Cookies

Some users wish to block cookies. Certain features of Privacy’s Services depend on cookies, so your experience may be negatively affected if cookies are disabled. Additionally, if you choose to delete cookies, settings and preferences controlled by those cookies, including advertising preferences, will be deleted and may need to be recreated.

However, we completely understand if you want to block cookies. At a high-level, here’s how you can:

* You can block cookies in your web browser. Your browser can also be set to alert you when cookies are placed on your device. Typically, browser cookie settings can be found in a browser’s settings. To find out how to specifically disable cookies in your browser, search for instructions in your browser’s help documentation.
* If you use Privacy’s Services on a mobile device, you can manage your device’s settings to limit the use of information shared for the purposes of advertising. Look in your device’s settings for “Limit Ad Tracking” (for iOS), “Opt out of Interest-Based Ads” (for Android), or similar controls.

To find out more about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set and how to manage and delete them, visit [www.aboutcookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/) or [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

#### Third-Party Websites

The Services contain hyperlinks to other websites or locations that we do not control and are operated and controlled by third parties (“Third-Party Websites”). Our Privacy Policy does not apply to these Third-Party Websites and we make no representations regarding the policies or business practices of any such Third-Party Websites.
