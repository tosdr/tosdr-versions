3.2.1.           Chargeback Notice. In the event that Client has elected Supplier’s Chargeback liability service, and an Approved Transaction turned out to generate an actual Eligible Chargeback (a “**Bad Transaction**”), then Client must notify Supplier of such Bad Transaction through the applicable feature on the Software within one (1) day from the date Client received notice of the applicable Eligible Chargeback (“**Chargeback Notice**”). Client will attach to the Chargeback Notice the requested details of the Transaction of an End User, the End User’s order amount (the “**Order Amount**”) and all other Transaction Information requested by Supplier.

3.2.2.           Chargeback Payment. Subject to Client’s continued compliance with the terms of this Agreement, and applicable Order Form, including but not limited to this Section ‎3 and any payment obligations, Supplier shall reimburse Client an amount equal to the lesser of: (x) the direct damages actually incurred by Client as a result of such Eligible Chargeback (including associated standard chargeback transaction/processing fees charged by the applicable financial institution); or (y) the sum of the amount of the Bad Transactions plus any associated standard chargeback transaction/processing fees charged by the applicable financial institution; each of (x) and (y) less any Third-Party Reimbursements (the “**Chargeback Payment**”).

3.2.6.           Representment. In the event Client or Supplier successfully dispute an Eligible Chargeback (in each case, the disputing party, the “**Representing Party**”) with respect to a Submitted Transaction for which Supplier has paid Client a Chargeback Payment, as indicated by notice of a voided chargeback from the financial institution that issued such Eligible Chargeback (“**Chargeback Reversal**”), then the Representing Party must notify the other Party by providing details regarding such Chargeback Reversal and the total amount refunded to Client related to such Chargeback Reversal (“**Chargeback Reimbursement**”) within 7 days from the date the Representing Party received notice.

Supplier will likewise assist Client with its obligations pursuant to applicable data protection laws, such as GDPR Articles 32-36, including also data security, data protection impact assessments, and breach notifications. Supplier will inform Client without delay, and in any event within 48 hours, if Supplier experiences or suspects a Personal Data Breach, and will provide full details to Client.

8.

Supplier will promptly delete and procure the deletion of Personal Data where so instructed by Client, unless and to the extent that retention is required by applicable laws.

9.

Where Supplier transfers EU Personal Data to a country outside the EEA which is not considered to provide adequate data protection, the Standard Contractual Clauses (“SCCs”) (https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32021D0914&from=EN) shall apply. For purposes of the SCCs, module 2 (controller to processor) shall apply. In Clause 9 option 2 (general written authorisation) will apply, authorization period will be 14 days. In Clause 11 the optional language will not apply. In Clause 17 governing law will be the Irish law; In Clause 18 disputes shall be resolved by the courts of Ireland. In Annex I Client is the ‘Data exporter’, Supplier is the ‘Data importer’; the ‘Data subjects’, ‘Categories of data’, ‘Frequency of the transfer’, ‘Nature of processing’, ‘Purpose’, ‘Retention period’ and ‘Subject matter, nature and duration of the processing’ are as described in the appendices below. The ‘competent supervisory authority’ is the Irish DPC.

10.

Supplier will make available all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with its obligations under Applicable Laws, such as GDPR Articles 28 and 32. Supplier will reasonably allow for and contribute to audits and inspection in this regard.

11.

Supplier may assign its respective rights and obligations hereunder where such assignment is by way of merger or acquisition of all or substantially all Supplier's equity or assets, or change of control.

12.

Invalidation of one or more of the provisions under this DPA will not affect the remaining provisions. Invalid provisions will be replaced, to the extent possible, by such valid provisions which achieve essentially the same objectives. The choice of law and jurisdiction governing this agreement will be the same as those governing the Agreement.

**Appendix C – Technical and Organizational Measures**

1.

**Information security program and certification**. Supplier is SOC2 Type II certified. A written security

program is implemented, maintained and complied with. As part of the program, Supplier: (i) implements an audit program to test and, if necessary, remediate identified gaps of all security controls at least annually or whenever there is a material change in business practices that may reasonably implicate the security or integrity of records containing Personal Data; (ii) conducts an annual information security assessment that assesses the threats and vulnerabilities associated with systems; and (iii) produces (pursuant to the results of (i) and (ii)) a documented information security assessment and, where appropriate, risk remediation plan.

2.

**Security official**. A designated management level security official is responsible for the development,

implementation, and ongoing maintenance of the information security program. The appointed official has appropriate recognized information security credentials and qualifications.

3.

**Access control**. Access rights are assigned according to the principle that employees and third-parties are

only granted the level of access they need to perform their activities (need-to-know principle) and only to those systems required for such activities. Access rights are granted according to defined (role-based) permissions. The access rights granted are reviewed regularly. Rights that are no longer required are withdrawn immediately. Access to systems is provided based on strong authentication policies.

4.

**Physical access control**. Secure areas are defined on the basis of information security and data protection

requirements and protected against unauthorized access by appropriate physical safeguards, defined based on the protection needs of the information located or accessed within them.

**Resilience and continuity**. a variety of tools and mechanisms are used to achieve high availability and

resiliency. Data is backed up on AWS and restoration of the back-ups are tested regularly to ensure we meet our recovery-point objective (RPO) and recovery-time-objective (RTO) commitments.

8.

**Third party vendor management**. security risk-based assessments of prospective vendors are carried out

before working with them to validate they meet our security requirements. Each vendor is periodically reviewed in light of its security and business continuity standards, controls necessary to protect data, and legal/regulatory requirements. Supplier ensures that customer data is returned and/or deleted at the end of a vendor relationship. a written agreements is in place with all vendors which includes confidentiality, privacy and security obligations that provide an appropriate level of protection for customer Data that these vendors may process.

9.

**Architecture and Data Segregation**. the cloud infrastructure used for the services is hosted by Amazon

Web Services (“AWS”). The AWS data center infrastructure used is located in the United States. Additional information about security provided by AWS is available at https://aws.amazon.com/security and https://aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/overview-of-security-processes. The production environment within AWS, where customer Data and the services are hosted, is a logically isolated Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Network access between production hosts is restricted, using firewalls to allow only authorized services to interact in the production network. Firewalls are in use to manage network segregation between different security zones in the production and corporate environments. Firewall rules are reviewed regularly.

10.

**Incident response plan**. Policies and procedures are implemented, designed to detect, respond to, and

otherwise address incidents, including specific points of contact in the event of an incident,

11.

**System testing and maintenance**. Supplier tests and maintains systems to protect data including, without

limitation: (i) installing of critical security patches for operating systems and applications within thirty (30) days of publication, and within three (3) months for other types of patches and updates, (ii) installing the latest recommended versions of operating systems, software and firmware for all system components, and (iii) ensuring that up-to-date system security agent software includes malware protection set to receive automatically updated (at least daily) patches and virus definitions.

12.

**Audit logging**. Hardware, software, or procedural mechanisms are implemented and maintained to record

and examine activity in processing systems that contain or use electronic information, including appropriate logs and reports concerning the security requirements set forth in this Annex.

12.

**Security awareness and privacy training**. An ongoing security and privacy awareness and training program

is maintained for all employees (including management, employees, contractors and other agents), which includes training on how to implement and comply with the information security program and setting forth disciplinary measures for violation of the security program. Security and privacy awareness training are conducted at least annually.
