_Date of Last Revision: October 18, 2023._

Goodbudget is a service of Dayspring Technologies, Inc. SPC (“Dayspring”), a California corporation. Goodbudget helps households and individuals to manage their budgets using the envelope budgeting method.

In addition, if you wish to become a registered user of the Services (“User”), please read this Terms of Use Agreement and indicate your acceptance by clicking the I agree checkbox on Goodbudget’s Registration Form. For avoidance of doubt, Apple, Inc. (“Apple”) is not a party to this Agreement.

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change, modify, add, or delete portions of this Terms of Use at any time without further notice. If we do this, we will post the changes to this Terms of Use at www.goodbudget.com/terms-of-use and will indicate at the top of that page the date these terms were last revised. Your continued use of the Services after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Use. If you do not agree to this or any future Terms of Use, you may not use or access (or continue to use or access) the Services. It is your responsibility to regularly check the Services to determine if there have been changes to this Terms of Use and to review such changes.

You understand, agree, and acknowledge that Dayspring is solely responsible for the Services. For avoidance of doubt, Apple is not responsible or liable for the Services or the content thereof, and you will look solely to Dayspring to meet any and all obligations, and for any liability, under this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, Apple has no responsibility or obligations whatsoever with respect to any product liability, legal, or regulatory compliance, consumer protection matters or claims related to intellectual property rights, in each case with respect to the Services. Should you have any questions concerning this Agreement, need technical support, or have complaints or claims with respect to the Services, you may contact Dayspring by emailing support@goodbudget.com.

In addition, you understand, agree, and acknowledge that Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third party beneficiaries of this Agreement. Upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement Apple, as a third party beneficiary of this Agreement, shall have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement against you.

You may receive a written copy of this Agreement by emailing us at: \[support at goodbudget.com\], Subject: Goodbudget Terms of Use Agreement.

### 1\. TERM.

This Agreement will remain in full force and effect while you use the Services. The Services are intended solely for users who are eighteen (18) years of age or older. Any registration by, use of or access to the Services by anyone under eighteen (18) is unauthorized, unlicensed, and in violation of these Terms of Use. The use of the “Goodbudget Free” plan under the Services is currently free of charge.

Organizations, companies, and/or businesses may not use the Services for any purpose other than those contemplated in this Terms of Use or Privacy Policy. Illegal and/or unauthorized uses by you of the Services, including collecting user names and/or email addresses of Users by electronic or other means for any reason, including — but not limited to, the purpose of sending unsolicited emails and unauthorized framing of or linking to the Services — is a violation of this Agreement, and appropriate legal action may be taken, including, without limitation, civil, criminal, and injunctive redress.

### 4\. PROPRIETARY RIGHTS IN THE SERVICES; LIMITED LICENSE.

All content on the Services and their selection and arrangement, but excluding User Content (the “Services Content”), are the proprietary property of Dayspring or its licensors, with all rights reserved. No Services Content may be modified, copied, distributed, framed, reproduced, republished, downloaded, scraped, displayed, posted, transmitted, or sold in any form or by any means, in whole or in part, without our prior written permission. Subject to these Terms of Use, you are granted a limited non-transferable license to access and use the Services and the Services Content on any device you legally own or control subject to any terms of use associated with that device, and to download or print a copy of any properly-accessed portion of the Services Content solely for your personal, non-commercial use, provided that you keep all copyright or other proprietary notices intact. Such license does not permit use of any data mining, robots, scraping, or similar data gathering or extraction methods. You further agree not to access (or attempt to access) any of the Services by any means other than through the interfaces provided by Dayspring. You may not rent, lease, lend, sell, redistribute, or sublicense any portion of the Services. Unless explicitly stated herein, nothing in these Terms of Use will be construed as conferring any license to intellectual property rights, whether by estoppel, implication or otherwise. We may revoke this license at any time without notice and with or without cause.

Dayspring reserves the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any of the Services or any features within the Services at Dayspring’s sole discretion and without prior notice to you.

While Dayspring may not currently have set a fixed upper limit on the number of transmissions you may send or receive through the Services or on the amount of storage space used for the provision of any Services, such fixed upper limits may be set by Dayspring at any time, at Dayspring’s sole discretion, and without prior notice to you.

Dayspring shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, price change, suspension, or discontinuance of the Services.

For avoidance of doubt, the parties understand, agree and acknowledge that Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the Services.

Do good.”, the “Goodbudget” logo and other Goodbudget graphics, logos, designs, page headers, button icons, scripts, and service names are our trademarks or trade dress in the U.S. and/or other countries. Our trademarks and trade dress may not be used, including as part of trademarks and/or as part of domain names, in connection with any product or service in any manner that is likely to cause confusion and may not be copied, imitated, or used, in whole or in part, without our prior written permission.

### 6\. USER CONTENT POSTED ON THE SERVICES.

Your account, transaction, and envelope information, and other information that you may from time-to-time provide, whether directly or indirectly such as through a financial data aggregation system, to the Services (collectively, “User Content”) belong to you and will be used solely to provide the Services to you in ways consistent with this Agreement.

By providing the User Content, you automatically grant and you represent and warrant that you own or have the necessary license, rights, consents, and permissions to grant, to Dayspring a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free and non-exclusive license to use, reproduce, display, adapt, modify, distribute, perform, and publish within the Services and for the purpose of providing the Services any content which you provide to the Services. Your account, transaction, and envelope information will only be published in a manner that is accessible through your account.

If you post User Content that is intended and understood to be publicly accessible, including all submissions to Dayspring’s blog and forums, you grant Dayspring a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free and non-exclusive license to use, reproduce, display, adapt, modify, distribute, perform, publish, and create derivative works of such content with no further accounting to you as long as attribution to you as author is preserved.

Other than the limited license set forth above, Dayspring acknowledges and agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors) under this Agreement in or to any User Content that you provide to the Services. You agree that you are responsible for protecting and enforcing your intellectual property rights and that Dayspring has no obligation to do so on your behalf.

Further, you will not enter your full name or alias on the Services, nor will you enter any email address outside of fields that request your email address, such as for registration or login.

You will not use Goodbudget if you are located in a country embargoed by the United States, or are on the United States Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.

### 7\. PRIVACY.

Use of the Services is also governed by our Privacy Policy available at [www.goodbudget.com/privacy-policy/](http://www.goodbudget.com/privacy-policy/).

### 8\. SUBSCRIPTIONS

Except with the “Free” plan, Dayspring charges a subscription fee (“Subscription Fee”) for the duration of your use of the Services. In this document, “Period” refers to the subscription interval for which a Subscription Fee is charged and Services are provided. A single Period can be one month or twelve (12) months depending on amount of the Subscription Fee.

You must provide Dayspring or its affiliates or partners with a valid credit card or debit card number with available credit or funds to pay the Subscription Fee. You authorize Dayspring or its affiliates or partners to make all charges described in this Agreement to your organization’s account. If the payment of your Subscription Fee fails for any reason, your account may be suspended until you provide Dayspring with valid credit card information and the Subscription Fee is paid.

The Subscription Fee for each of the Services is dependent on the Service. Dayspring reserves the right, at any time, to modify its Subscription Fee and billing methods. Current Subscription Fees are posted within your Dayspring account on the “Subscriptions” page.

Subscription Fees may be charged to your account in advance on a periodic basis. The Subscription Fee is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial Periods of Service or for Periods unused with an open account. You are responsible for payment of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities on your Subscription Fee.

### 9\. SUBSCRIPTIONS TERMS AND TERMINATION

All Services are made available on a periodic basis through the Dayspring website, the Apple App Store, and Google Play. Periodic subscriptions will be automatically renewed by Dayspring unless you disable a Service or disable automatic renewal.

You may disable any Service at any time by accessing the Subscription page in your account and following the instructions for disabling a Service. Disabling of any Service will take effect after any existing paid Periods expire. When you disable a Service, no charges for the Service will appear in your Subscription Fee for the next billing cycle. Requests to disable any Service or cancel your account must be processed before 5PM Pacific Time two days before your monthly billing cycle in order to avoid a subsequent charge for your Subscription Fee.

Disabling any Service may cause the loss of content, features, or capacity of your account. Canceling your account will cause the immediate loss of all Content, features, and capacity of your account. This information cannot be recovered and Dayspring does not accept any liability for such loss.

Dayspring, in its sole discretion, may immediately terminate this Agreement, your account and all current or future use of the Services, for any reason at any time. Termination of your account includes removal of your access to all Services, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all User Content in your account. Dayspring reserves the right to refuse services to anyone for any reason at any time.

### 10\. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS COMPLAINTS.

When we receive proper notification of alleged copyright infringement, we will investigate and may remove or disable access to the allegedly infringing material and may terminate, in our sole discretion, the accounts of repeat infringers in accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and other applicable law. We may also, at our sole discretion, limit access to the Services and/or terminate the memberships of any Users who infringe any intellectual property rights of others, whether or not there is any repeat infringement. If you believe that any material on the Services infringes upon any copyright which you own or control, you may contact us. Dayspring will assess the material and may remove the material from public viewing.

Such Third Party Sites and Third Party Components are not investigated, monitored or checked for accuracy, appropriateness, or completeness by us, and we are not responsible for the acts or omissions of any Third Party Sites or Third Party Components. If you decide to leave the Services and access the Third Party Sites or to use or install any Third Party Components, you do so at your own risk and our terms and policies no longer govern. You should review the applicable terms and policies, including privacy and data gathering practices, of any Third Party Services to which you navigate from the Services or relating to any Third Party Components.

### 12\. VIRAL DISTRIBUTION WIDGETS.
