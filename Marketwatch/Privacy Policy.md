Certain features on the Dow Jones Services give you an opportunity to interact with us and others. These features include collaboration tools, community forums, chats, submitting a letter to the editor, creating community profiles, rating, tagging, and commenting on articles. If you choose to use these features, any information you choose to share (such as your name, user name, email address, picture or image, likes, status, and comments) becomes public and can be used for purposes over which we have no control. We are not responsible for any information you choose to submit and make public through these interactive features.

3.4 To Deliver Interest-Based Advertising (_aka_ Targeted Advertising)

As described in this Privacy Notice and our [Cookie Notice](https://www.dowjones.com/cookie-notice/), we, as well as our third-party service providers, may obtain information about your online activity to provide you with advertising about products and services tailored to your individual interests. We also engage third party online advertising companies, advertisers and ad networks to help target our messaging to visitors through interest-based and contextual means. These third parties may collect information about your activities on our Dow Jones Services and on other websites or apps including offline purchases, for such purpose. The networks use this information to show you advertisements on the Dow Jones Services or other third-party websites and apps that may be tailored to your individual interests. This information also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. To the extent required by applicable law, we will obtain your consent before using your information for interest-based advertising. To learn how to opt out of online interest-based advertising (or, as it may be called in some jurisdictions, targeted advertising), please follow the instructions in the [Your Choices and Rights](https://www.dowjones.com/privacy-notice/?mod=DJnotice#rightsAndChoices) section below.

3.5 To Protect The Rights Of Dow Jones And Others

Dow Jones may use your personal data as we believe to be necessary or appropriate in order to:

* Protect against, identify and prevent fraud and other unlawful activity, claims and other liabilities;
* Secure, protect and defend the privacy, safety or property of the Dow Jones Services, and our employees and agents, or users;
* Comply with and enforce legal requirements, including laws outside your country of residence, relevant industry standards, contractual obligations, and our terms of service and other policies; and
* Respond to inquiries from third parties, including inquiries from law enforcement authorities.

We may combine information we obtain about you for the purposes identified in this Section 3. We may use information we collect from you in other ways for which we provide specific privacy notices at the time of collection.

4\. DATA SHARING

We may share your personal data with:

4.1 Our Subsidiaries and Affiliated Businesses

We may share your personal data with our subsidiaries and affiliated companies (collectively, “Dow Jones Affiliates”) for the purposes described in this Privacy Notice, including for each company's marketing purposes (with your consent if required by applicable law). A list of Dow Jones Affiliates is available in annual reports accessible [here](https://investors.newscorp.com/node/14306/html#ex-211xfy23listofsubsidiar.htm).  Users who visit Dow Jones Affiliates’ services should still refer to their separate privacy policies, which may differ in some respects from this Privacy Notice.

4.2 Subscription/Access Providers

If your subscription or other access is provided in whole or in part by your employer, educational institution or other third party, we may share with them information about your access to and use of your subscription or other product or service, including for access through educational institutions, your name and email address.

4.3 Our Service Providers

We may share some or all of your personal data identified above, as necessary for the specific services, with our service providers, who provide services to us or to you on our behalf (e.g., sending email or Text Messages on our behalf, processing payments, fulfilling orders or delivering subscriptions or improving or customizing the Dow Jones Services). These third party service providers are not authorized to use it for any other purpose than the specific service they are providing to us or to you on our behalf.

4.4 Our Business Partners

We may share your data with business partners to provide you with co-branded services or features that you participate in, such as conferences, events, contests, sweepstakes or other promotions ("Co-Branded Services"). These Co-Branded Services may be hosted by the Dow Jones Services or on the third party's service. The business partner's use of your information will be governed by its privacy notice.

4.5 With Third Parties for Direct Marketing

We may share your information with third party partners whose offerings we think may be of interest to you. For example, if you subscribe to the U.S. edition of The Wall Street Journal or Barron’s print publications, we may share your print mailing address with unaffiliated third party companies whose products and services may be of interest to you. While many of our subscribers appreciate receiving offerings from these companies, if you prefer that we do not share your information for this purpose, please refer to the [Your Choices and Rights](https://www.dowjones.com/privacy-notice/?mod=DJnotice#rightsAndChoices) section below.

The above paragraph does _not_ apply to personal data collected through our WSJ Amenity Text-To-Me Service.

4.6 With Social Networking Services

As discussed in Section 2.3 of our Privacy Notice and in our [Social Networking Services Notice](https://www.dowjones.com/social-networking-services-notice/), we may share your information when you log into or connect a social media service account with the Dow Jones Services. The Dow Jone Services may also offer you the ability to share information to a social networking site (e.g., Facebook, Twitter), by using integrated tools (e.g., Facebook “Like” button, or Twitter “Tweet” button). To control this sharing of information, please review and adjust your privacy settings for the relevant social network. The social networking service's use of the shared information will be governed by its privacy notice.

4.7 For Legal Requirements and Proceedings

We may disclose your personal data to law enforcement authorities or other government officials if we are required to do so to comply with subpoenas, court orders, legal process or other government measures, and to comply with other legal obligations. We may also disclose information if we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual fraud or illegal activity.

4.8 With Other Third Parties To Complete A Corporate Transaction

We may disclose information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or part of our business or assets (including in the event of a merger, reorganization, dissolution or liquidation) to the third party or its advisors involved in such corporate transaction

4.9 With Third Parties for the Protection of the Dow Jones Services and Our Users

We may disclose your personal data to protect and defend the rights, interests and safety of the Dow Jones Services and our users, our subsidiaries and affiliates, and our and their employees, contractors and agents; and to protect the security of our Services, including when we believe necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss.

5\. YOUR CHOICES AND RIGHTS

5.1.4 Browser Controls

You have choices about whether cookies or similar technologies are placed on your computer or mobile device. For more information, visit our [Cookie Notice](https://www.dowjones.com/cookies-policy/).

5.2 Your Rights

Subject to applicable law, you may have certain rights to access, review, update, correct inaccuracies in or delete your personal data in our custody and control, which you may seek to exercise by submitting a request [here](https://privacyportal.onetrust.com/webform/8930e991-baac-4a05-89f0-fc400879fa8a/3ad033f6-a159-4ef9-a0ad-aa2cf41fef65), or by contacting us as specified in the “[Contact Us](https://www.dowjones.com/privacy-notice/?mod=DJnotice#contactUs)” section below.

For security purposes, we will seek to verify your identity – in part by requesting certain information from you – as part of our process. For instance, you may need to provide your name and email address. For certain types of requests, we may also need to ask you for additional information to verify your identity. Once we have verified your identity, we will respond to your request as appropriate.

5.2.1 The right to access and rectification or correction

You may have the right to access, correct or update your personal data at any time. Additionally, online subscribers and registered users may access their personal data online by signing into their accounts and visiting the appropriate account management sections of our websites. Please note that if you have subscribed or registered for our print and online editions, or for more than one of our publications or services, you may need to update your information for each separately.

Where you have provided your consent for our use of your personal data, you have the right to withdraw your consent and we will apply your preferences going forward.

5.2.2 The right to deletion

Under certain circumstances, you may have the right to request that we delete your data. If you wish to delete the personal data we hold about you, please let us know and we will take reasonable steps to respond to your request in accordance with applicable legal requirements. Certain data may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. We may also need to retain certain types of data so that we can provide the Dow Jones Services to you. If you ask us to delete your data, you may no longer be able to access or use our Services.

6\. HOW WE PROTECT PERSONAL DATA

Dow Jones uses a combination of administrative, technical, organizational and physical measures to safeguard personal data in its possession against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized loss, use, access, disclosure or modification. We make reasonable efforts to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of the processing, taking into account the costs of implementation and nature of the processing of personal data. However, no one can guarantee the complete safety of your information. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us as set forth in the Contact Us section below.

7\. OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION

7.1 Do Not Track Disclosure

Some browsers or other tools include “Do Not Track” (DNT) features which, when turned on, send a signal to websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked across websites over time. However, since no technology standard for DNT signals has been developed or adopted to date, Dow Jones does not currently respond to DNT signals.

7.2 Transfers of Personal Data

Your personal data may be stored, transferred to, and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers. These countries may be outside your country of residence, including the United States, and may have different data protection laws than in the country in which you initially provided the data. Applicable laws in the United States and/or other countries may allow the courts, law enforcement and national security authorities to access your personal data when in such country.

If you are a user located outside the United States or the country to which your information may be transferred, you understand (and, as permitted under applicable law, consent to) having any personal data processed in the United States or such country. When we transfer your data, we will protect that data as described in this Privacy Notices.

7.3 Collection of Personal Financial Information by a Payment Service

In some cases, we may use an unaffiliated payment service to allow you to purchase a product or service or make payments (“Payment Service”). If you wish to purchase a product or service or make a payment, in such a case, you will be directed to a Payment Service webpage. Any information that you provide to a Payment Service will be subject to the applicable Payment Service’s privacy notice, rather than this Privacy Notice. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, any Payment Service’s use of information collected through any Payment Service.

7.4 Links to Affiliates and Third Party Sites or Apps

The Dow Jones Services may also be linked to sites or apps operated by third parties, and may carry advertisements or offer content, special offers, functionality, games or applications developed and maintained by third parties, using iframes, tools, or plug-ins (“Linked Services”). These third party Linked Services may use automated means to collect information about you and your use of these features. Some of these third party sites may be co-branded with a Dow Jones logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by us.

Dow Jones is not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties, and once you leave the Dow Jones Services or click an advertisement, or sign up for a special offer, you should check the applicable third party privacy notice.

7.5 Updates to Privacy Notice

Dow Jones may periodically update this Privacy Notice without prior notice to reflect changes in our privacy practices and the Dow Jones Services. If we modify the Privacy Notice, we will update the Effective Date and the changes will become effective as of the date we post such Notice. We will notify you of any material changes by posting a prominent notice on the Dow Jones Services indicating we have updated this Privacy Notice.
