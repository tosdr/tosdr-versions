8\. Acceptable Use Policy of the Unlimited Premium Plan
-------------------------------------------------------

In order to ensure the optimum service experience for all our customers, the usage of the Convertio Unlimited premium plan is subject to our acceptable use policy.

While we do not impose restrictions on the maximum file size, maximum conversion duration, or the quantity of files one can convert under the Unlimited plan, to ensure that the service received by other customers is not impacted through extremely heavy usage by a minority of people, we reserve the right to regulate conversion speed or terminate the subscription unilaterally in the event that it is discovered that the service is being used in incommensurable amount.

In the event of a unilateral termination of your subscription before the end of the paid subscription period, you might be eligible for a prorated refund of the amount paid.

You hereby agree not to circumvent this Use Policy by any means, including, but not limited to the creation of multiple accounts, acquisition of multiple premium plans, or using a single premium plan on an enormous amount of devices.

Considering our enormous file conversion capabilities, it is highly improbable that you will encounter the need to adhere to this acceptable use policy. However, should you have any doubts, we encourage you to reach out to our support team and provide details regarding your specific use case.

9\. Use Restrictions
--------------------

Your permission to use the Service is conditioned upon the following Use and Conduct Restrictions:

You agree that you will not under any circumstances:

* convert any content that is abusive, threatening, obscene, defamatory, libelous, or racially, sexually, religiously, or otherwise objectionable and offensive,
* use the service for any unlawful purposes or to promote illegal activities,
* attempt to harass, abuse, or harm another person or group,
* use another user's account without proper authorization,
* provide false or inaccurate information when registering an account or ordering a premium plan,
* interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper functioning of the Service,
* engage in any automated use of the system or take actions that may impose an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our servers or network infrastructure,
* bypass any robot exclusion techniques or other measures we may have implemented to restrict access to the Service or use any software, technology, or device to scrape, spider, scan, crawl the Service, or to harvest or manipulate data,
* convert malicious content intended to damage or disrupt the service or pose a risk to another user's browser or computer.

10\. Refunds
------------

Please, review the refund terms, and thoroughly evaluate the free version of our service before considering a subscription purchase.

We provide the Service "as is". Your usage of it is entirely at your own risk and discretion, and as such, it is not accompanied by any warranties, neither express nor implied. No implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, availability, security, title, or non-infringement apply.

You have the option to use our service for free or opt for a subscription (billed on a monthly or annual basis).

The free version allows you to assess the functionality of our service and make an informed decision regarding its adherence to advertised features and its compatibility with your requirements, including functionality, format compatibility, speed, and quality.

Please ensure thorough testing of the service prior to making a subscription purchase, because we DO NOT ISSUE REFUNDS once a subscription has been acquired.

Your subscription will be automatically renewed unless explicitly canceled. You will receive email notifications regarding each upcoming payment from our billing partner.

Should you no longer require our service, kindly remember to cancel your subscription before the renewal date to avoid charges for the subsequent cycle.

Cancellation of your subscription can be done through the following methods:

* You may cancel your subscription via the [https://convertio.co/settings/](https://convertio.co/settings/) page by following this tutorial titled "How to cancel an active subscription?" ([https://support.convertio.co/hc/en-us/articles/360004417833](https://support.convertio.co/hc/en-us/articles/360004417833))
* You can contact our support team via the [https://support.convertio.co/hc/en-us/requests/new](https://support.convertio.co/hc/en-us/requests/new) with a subscription cancellation request before the end of the current billing cycle.

If the subscription is canceled prior to the renewal date, you will maintain access to all premium features until the end of the billing cycle. (To utilize the subscription for a single month, it is imperative to cancel it during the first billing cycle, even on the very first day the order was placed).

**We regret to inform you that we DO NOT ISSUE REFUNDS once a subscription has been purchased, including in the following cases:**

* You encountered an error while attempting to convert DRM-protected media (audio, video, eBooks) — including those, directly acquired from sources such as iTunes or Amazon, which frequently employ DRM protection for their files.
* You encountered an error while attempting to convert password-protected Documents or Archives.
* You are attempting to convert a large file, typically, a video, and are dissatisfied with the upload speed while uploading it from your local device. Please be aware that upload speed is beyond our control and depends solely on your internet connection's upload bandwidth or your internet service provider's (ISP) upload capabilities. Our servers are located in Germany, and you can use https://speedtest.net/ to assess your upload bandwidth to a German host. Kindly, reach out to your ISP for further assistance.
* You are dissatisfied with the speed of video conversion. It is essential to note that the time required to convert a Full HD video from one video format to another may be as long as half the actual video duration. Also, lower resolutions generally yield faster conversions. This is because we not just simply change the video container but perform a full re-encoding of both video and audio streams.
* You are attempting to convert corrupted files that cannot be opened even by their native applications. We endeavor to make the conversions even in the most hopeless or challenging cases, but if a file is not readable at all, such as when it lacks headers or a moov atom in the case of video files, regrettably, there is nothing we can do.
* You just don’t like the service or no longer need it.
* You have already converted a file that exceeds the free tier's limitations and have downloaded the result — it implies that you have already utilized the service you paid for.
* You’re dissatisfied with the features offered by our service or you haven’t found some particular features.
* You have experienced temporary technical issues while using our service. We make every effort to promptly resolve any service-related issues or bugs as soon as they are reported by users or service reliability engineer.
* You’ve found another service that you like better or that better suits your needs.
* You have missed your deadlines or suffer any other damages or losses that may arise from your use of our service or its unavailability. Please be aware that you utilize the service at your own discretion and risk, and it does not come with any warranty.
* You inadvertently forget to cancel your subscription or request assistance from our support team to unsubscribe before the subscription renewal date.
