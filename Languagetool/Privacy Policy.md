When you report content on a Learneo Service utilizing the [Learneo Report Content Form](https://www.learneo.com/legal/illegal-content-notice), we will collect your contact information (including your first and last name, address, country, and email address) so that we can remain in contact with you during the process and ensure that your notice is sufficiently addressed. This information will be used to process your request and keep a record of your notice.

##### _Information That is Not Personal Data_

We may create aggregated, de-identified or anonymized data from the personal data we collect, including by removing information that makes the data personally identifiable to a particular user.

    * Conducting fraud protection activities, implementing security and debugging.

#### Tracking Tools, Advertising and Your Choices

Learneo and our third-party providers collect information in the Services through tracking technologies, including but not limited to, cookies (small pieces of information or text files that a website sends to your computer for record-keeping purposes and is stored in a file on your computer's hard drive), web beacons (also known as "tracking pixels"), embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies, fingerprinting, device recognition technologies, in-app tracking methods and other tracking technologies now and hereafter developed ("Tracking Technologies"). Further details about the Tracking Technologies we use (including the purpose for using them), interest-based advertising, your choices and how to manage cookies and do-not-track signals are below, and can also be found in each Service's respective Cookie Policy, linked in each Service's [Part Two](#part-two) section of this Privacy Policy

##### _Advertising_

We may serve ads on our Services or on external services and engage and work with Service Providers and other third parties to serve advertisements on the Services and/or on Third-Party Services. Some of these ads may be tailored to your interests based on your browsing, across time, of the Services and elsewhere on the Internet, which may include use of data from cross-device usage, sometimes referred to as "interest-based advertising" and "online behavioral advertising" ("Interest-based Advertising"), which may include sending you an ad on a third-party service after you have left the Services (i.e., "retargeting"). Our advertisers' and ad networks' use of Tracking Technologies are governed by their own privacy policies. Further details about interest-based advertising, your choices and how to manage related cookies can also be found in each Service's respective Cookie Policy, linked in each Service's [Part Two section of this Privacy Policy](#part-two).

##### _Your Cookies and Tracking Technologies Choices_

We may use Tracking Technologies to collect information about interactions with the Services, including information about your browsing and purchasing behavior. Tracking Technologies make Web-surfing and browsing easier for you by saving your preferences so that we can use the saved information to facilitate and improve your use of the Services.

* Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some instances blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Browsers offer different functionalities and options so you may need to set them separately. Also, tools from commercial browsers may not be effective with regard to some Tracking Technologies, such as HTML5 cookies. Please be aware that if you disable or remove these technologies, some parts of the Services may not work and that when you revisit the Services your ability to limit browser-based Tracking Technologies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.
* Some App-related Tracking Technologies in connection with non-browser usage (e.g., most functionality of a mobile app) can only be disabled by uninstalling the app. To uninstall an app, follow the instructions from your operating system or handset manufacturer. Apple and Google mobile device settings have settings to limit ad tracking, and other tracking, but these may not be completely effective.
* Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a "Do Not Track" signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there is no consensus among industry participants as to what "Do Not Track" means in this context. Like many online services, we currently do not alter our practices when we receive a "Do Not Track" signal from a visitor's browser. To find out more about "Do Not Track," you can visit [http://www.allaboutdnt.com](http://www.allaboutdnt.com/), but we are not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of this third-party information. You have the right to request information from us about the Services that currently do not respond to "do not track" mechanisms featured in any Internet browser by contacting us according to the "Contact Information for Specific Learneo Services" section above.
* Many advertisers and service providers that perform advertising-related services for us and third parties participate in voluntary programs that provide tools to opt-out of such interest-based advertising such as the Digital Advertising Alliance's ("DAA") Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding interest-based advertising for DAA members, visit [https://youradchoices.com/](https://youradchoices.com/), and [http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices](http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices) for information on the DAA's opt-out program for mobile apps. Some of these companies also are members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"). To learn more about the NAI and your opt-out options for their members, see [http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) .
* Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of Interest-based Advertising, you may continue to receive other types of ads. Opting out only means that those selected, participating members should no longer deliver certain interest-based advertising to you but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit these opt-out webpages, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different device or web browser or use a non-browser-based method of access (e.g., mobile app), your browser-based opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective.
* We support IAB 2009 Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising ( [https://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ven-principles-07-01-09.pdf](https://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ven-principles-07-01-09.pdf) ) and expect that ad networks that we directly engage to serve you interest-based advertising will do so as well, though we cannot guarantee their compliance. We are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties' opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.
* In addition, we may serve ads on third-party services that are targeted to reach people on those third-party services that are also identified on one or more of our databases ("Matched List Ads"). This is done by using Tracking Technologies, or by matching common factors between our databases and the databases of the third-party services. We are not responsible for these third-party services, including without limitation their security of the data. We are not responsible for such third parties' failure to comply with your or our opt-out instructions as they may not give us notice of opt-outs to our ads that you give to them, and they may change their options without notice to us or you. For more information, please see the selling and sharing sections of the applicable State-Specific Rights section.
* If you are located in the EEA, UK or Canada, you can manage your cookie consent choices using the consent management platform on the applicable Service. If you do not wish to accept non-Essential Cookies in connection with your use of the Services or wish to withdraw your consent, you can opt out by selecting “Reject All” or by selecting "Customize" (or similarly phrased options) and changing your Cookies Preferences

##### _Session Replay Tools_

On certain pages of certain Learneo Services, we use session replay tools provided by third party service providers, including Fullstory, Inc., Amplitude Inc., and Microsoft. Session replay tools are a necessary tool for Learneo to provide our Services. These tools allow Learneo to understand user activity and content performance to help deliver and optimize our Services, find and fix performance issues, continuously improve our user's experience, and to investigate and prevent fraud and abuse. Depending on how you use our Services, our session replay tools may automatically collect the following information:

* Device-dependent data collected by your computer and web browser:
* IP address
* E-mail address including your first and last name, insofar as you have provided it to us via our Services
* Screen size of your terminal
* Device browser information and identifiers
* Geographical data (country only)
* Language for displaying our website
* User interactions
* Mouse commands (movement, position and clicks)
* Date and time of access
* Keystrokes (not for sensitive fields like passwords or credit card information)

Our session replay tools service providers use this information to evaluate your use of our Services, to compile reports on usage and to provide us similar services for evaluating our website. Our session replay service providers themselves also use third-party services (e.g. Google) to provide these services, who may store or otherwise process information that your browser transmits when you visit our certain Services (including, under certain circumstances, your IP address).

For more information about the session replay tools we use, see:

* [Fullstory Privacy Policy](https://www.fullstory.com/legal/privacy-policy/)
* [Microsoft Clarity Privacy Policy](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement.)
* [Amplitude Privacy Policy](https://amplitude.com/privacy)

How We Share Your Personal Data

### _Sharing with Third-Parties_

If we undergo a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or other transaction in which a third party assumes control of our business (in whole or in part), your personal data may be transferred to that third party. Should one of these events occur, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you before your information becomes subject to different privacy and security policies and practices.

Details of the categories of personal data and the third parties with whom we share your personal data that we have collected over the past 12 months may be found in the relevant Part Two section for each Service below.

### _Sharing With Government Authorities and Law Enforcement_

When you use our Services, we may access and share the personal data described in the applicable Part Two section with regulators, law enforcement, or other government agencies as required by applicable law or if we have a good-faith belief that we must do so to comply with court orders or government requests supported with legal process. We may also do so for the purposes of detecting, investigating and preventing fraud or illegal activity on our Services, and to protect the rights and safety of our users. If we share your personal information with government or law enforcement to comply with a court order or other legal process, we will notify you of that disclosure unless we are legally obligated not to do so. For information on the categories of information that may be shared for the purposes and the legal bases for doing so, see the [Additional Terms For European Economic Area And UK Residents](#part-one-additional-terms-for-european-economic-area-and-uk-residents) section in this Policy.

Marketing Communications
------------------------

When you register an account or subscribe to a Service, you will receive marketing communications related to Learneo's learning and productivity services as well as transactional and account-related communications, by email and as permitted by applicable law. We will collect your email address as well as other information you provide on a voluntary basis to help tailor communications to you. In any marketing communication from a Learneo Service, you can unsubscribe at any time by clicking the "unsubscribe" link included at the bottom of each email. You may also opt-out of receiving marketing communications at any time either through your account settings or by contacting us (see [Contact Us](#part-one-contact-us) section above). Please note that you will continue to receive transactional or account-related communications.

Data Security
-------------

We take commercially reasonable steps to protect your personal data from unauthorized access, use and disclosure using appropriate physical, technical, organizational and administrative security measures based on the type of personal data and how we are processing that data.

Examples of data security measures we implement include regular security vulnerability scanning of our Services in order to make your visit to or use of our Services as safe as possible; maintaining personal data behind secured networks that are only accessible by a limited number of persons with special access rights to such systems and who are under obligation to keep the information confidential; and implementing a variety of security measures when a user enters, submits, or accesses their information to maintain the safety of your personal data.

You should also help protect your data by appropriately selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism; limiting access to your computer or device and browser; and signing off after you have finished accessing your account. Although we work to protect the security of your account and other data that we hold in our records, please be aware that no method of transmitting data over the internet or storing data is completely secure.

Data Retention
--------------

We will retain your personal data as described in the applicable [Part Two](#part-two) section for the relevant Service you are using.

Changes To This Privacy Policy
------------------------------

We are constantly working to grow our business and improve our Services, offer new Services and features to you, and keep up with applicable laws. For these reasons we may need to change this privacy policy from time to time. When we make material changes, we will provide you with a reasonable form of online notice of the updated policy.

Additional Terms For Canadian Residents
---------------------------------------

If you reside in Canada, the following additional terms apply. If there are any conflicts between this section and any other provision of this policy, the provision that is more protective of personal data will apply.

### _Transfers of Personal Data Outside Canada_

We may transfer your personal data within Learneo, with third party service-providers and other third parties that require such information to assist us in providing Services to you. In the course of providing these Services, your personal data may be accessed, collected, stored and processed in the U.S. or other foreign jurisdictions by Learneo or its third party service providers. Learneo and third-party service providers may disclose your personal data in response to a search warrant or other legally valid inquiry or order or as otherwise required or permitted by Canadian, US, or other law (which may include disclosure to US and foreign courts, law enforcement or governmental authorities). In the case of a transfer of personal data to Learneo or third-party service providers that process or store personal data on behalf of Learneo, Learneo and/or third party recipient will have agreed to safeguard personal data and use the information only for the purpose(s) for which it has been provided.

### _Canadian Resident Rights_

Subject to applicable law, you have the right to access, update and correct inaccuracies in your personal data in our custody or control. You can request this by email or by writing to us at the contact information set out in the [Contact Information for Specific Learneo Services](#part-one-contact-us) section above. We may request certain personal data for the purpose of verifying the identity of the individual seeking access to his or her personal data records.

Additional Terms For California Residents

This section provides information in accordance with the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act for California residents about how Learneo handles certain personal data collected over the past 12 months. If you are a California resident, you have the rights set forth in this section. For how to exercise these rights, see the [Exercising Your CCPA Rights](#exercising-your-ccpa-rights) section. If there are any conflicts between this section and any other provision of this policy, the portion that is more protective of your personal data will apply.

### _California Resident Rights under the CCPA_

    * The categories of personal data that we have collected about you.

    * The categories of third parties with whom we have shared your personal data.
    * The specific pieces of personal data that we have collected about you.
* _Right to Correct_. You have the right to correct inaccuracies in your personal data, depending on the type of personal data and our purposes for processing it.
* _Deletion._ You have the right to request that we delete the personal data that we have collected about you. Under the CCPA, this right is subject to certain exceptions: for example, we may need to retain your personal data to provide you with the Services or complete a transaction or other action you have requested. Please see the [Data Retention](#part-part-one-data-retention) section on our purposes for retaining limited personal data.
* _Right to Opt-Out of Certain Activities._ In some circumstances, you have the right to opt out of the sale of your personal data or the sharing of your personal data specifically for cross-contextual behavioral advertising purposes.

_Exercising Your CCPA Rights._ To exercise the rights described above, you or your Authorized Agent (defined below) must send us a request that (1) provides sufficient information to allow us to verify that you are the person about whom we have collected personal data, and (2) describes your request in sufficient detail to allow us to understand, evaluate and respond to it. Each request that meets both criteria will be considered a "Valid Request ." We may deny requests that do not meet these criteria as permitted by applicable data privacy laws. You may appeal any denial by contacting us using the relevant contact information provided in Part One. . We will only use personal data provided in a Valid Request to verify your identity and complete your request. You do not need an account to submit a Valid Request.

If we determine that your Valid Request warrants a fee, we will notify you of the fee and explain that decision before completing your request. Please see the [Contact Information for Specific Learneo Services](#part-one-contact-us) section for where to submit a Valid Request.

#### Cross Border Transfers of Personal Data

Learneo has offices located in the United States, Israel, India, The Netherlands, Germany, and Canada and may continue to grow in other countries. We also have service providers both in the United States and throughout the world. As such, Learneo and our service providers may transfer your personal data to, or access it in, jurisdictions that may not provide equivalent levels of data protection as your home jurisdiction. These transfers are necessary in order for us to provide our Services. When we transfer information about individuals based in the EEA or UK outside of those countries, we will take appropriate measures to safeguard the transfer as required by applicable law, including:

* **Adequacy Decisions**: European Commission decisions recognizing that certain countries and territories outside of the EEA ensure an adequate level of protection for personal data. Depending on your use of our Services, when we transfer your personal data from the EEA to Israel or the UK, we rely on the European Commission's adequacy decision for Israel and the UK. Further, where we transfer your personal data from the EEA to an US recipient participating in the DPF (including the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (DPF), where applicable), we rely on the European Commission's adequacy decision for the US.
* **Standard Contractual Clauses**: Transfers to countries that don't have an adequacy decision typically take place on the basis of the European Commission-approved standard contractual data protection clauses (together with the UK Annex for transfers from the UK), which we use for transfers to countries including but not limited to the US (where the recipient does not participate in the DPF), and Singapore.

In certain circumstances, cross border transfers may take place on the basis of exemptions provided for under applicable data protection law.

You may always contact us to request a copy of the transfer measures that we have taken to safeguard the transfer of your personal data.

##### Complaints

You have the right to lodge a complaint about our practices with respect to your personal data before a supervisory data protection authority.

* If you are in Europe, an up-to-date list of data protection authorities is available at [https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members\_en](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en).
* If you are in the Netherlands, the data protection authority is the Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens, available at: [https://autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl](https://autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/).
* If you are in the UK, the data protection authority is the UK Information Commissioner's Office available at [https://ico.org.uk/](https://ico.org.uk/).

#### Additional Terms for Australian Residents

If you reside in Australia, the following additional terms apply in accordance with the Australian Privacy Principles ("APPs") and the Privacy Act 1988 ("APA"). If there are any conflicts between this section and any other provision of this policy, the following terms shall prevail.

##### _Government ID_

To the extent we collect any government ID (such as driver's license, photo card, etc), we recognise that government ID is a special category of personal information that is subject to a higher standard of privacy protection compared to other types of personal data. Notwithstanding any other part of this policy, to the extent that we collect any such government ID from you, we will only collect, use and disclose such data strictly for the identity verification purpose set out in this privacy policy or for a purpose permitted under APP 9. We will not handle your government ID in any other manner or for any other purpose. Subject to any retention requirements under law or otherwise specified in this privacy policy, we will destroy or de-identify any record of your government ID stored in our systems when we no longer need to use it.

##### _How To Access, Correct, Update, or Delete Your Personal Data_

You can request to access, correct, update or delete your personal data by contacting us using the contact details provided under the Contact us section in Part One.

You can request access to any personal data we hold about you at any time. However please be aware that from time to time we may need to reject your request to access personal data we hold about you, if we believe such rejection to be necessary and to the extent allowed by law.

If we do not provide you with access to any of your personal data, or do not correct any of your personal data, we will provide you with our reasons. If you are not satisfied with our reasons, you may make a complaint as set out below under the Complaints section.

##### _Complaints_

We take your privacy concerns seriously. If you have a complaint regarding our handling of your personal data or concerning our privacy practices, you may file a complaint with our Privacy Officer using the contact provided under the Contact us section in Part One. Our Compliance team will confirm receipt of your complaint and review it with our legal team. If we believe an investigation is necessary, we will open an investigation into your complaint. We may need to contact you to request further details of your complaint. If an investigation has been opened following a complaint made by you, we will contact you with the result of that complaint as soon as possible.

If you are not satisfied with the outcome of your complaint, you may refer your complaint to the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner by contacting 1300 363 992 or by visiting the website www.oaic.gov.au. Further information about the APA and the APPs is also available from the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner.

##### _Transfers of Personal Data Outside Australia_

We may share your personal data amongst Learneo, with third party service-providers and other third parties that require such information to assist us in providing Services to you. Your personal data may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than Australia, including United States, Israel, India, The Netherlands, and Canada or other countries as might be the case in the future. We will only transfer your personal data overseas for the same purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. Personal data that is stored overseas may not be subject to the APA or the APPs. However, we will not transfer or permit any of your personal data to be transferred outside of Australia unless we have taken reasonable steps to ensure the transfer is in compliance with applicable laws, and in any case to a recipient that has privacy protections in place which are at least substantially similar to which the APPs protect information.

##### _Consequences If We Can't Collect Your Personal Data_

If you do not provide us with the personal data we need, we may not be able to provide appropriate services, targeted content or relevant information to you, and in some cases you may not be able to use our Services.

#### Additional Terms for Mexican Residents

##### _Purposes and Consent_

For residents of Mexico, all of the purposes listed in this privacy policy are considered necessary for the existence, continuity and fulfilling of our contractual relationship with you and are considered primary purposes. Learneo therefore does not require your express consent for the processing of your data for these purposes. Any other purpose other than these primary purposes are considered secondary purposes, to which you will be provided notice and opportunity to object to processing of your personal data for those purposes at the time. You may also notify us of your objection by email to [\[email protected\]](https://languagetool.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

Please note that for processing described in the “Sharing with Third Parties” section, we will obtain your consent for such transfers when required by law. Otherwise, exceptions under Mexican law permit the processing described in this section, such as to perform our contract with you to provide our Services, to comply with applicable law or administration of justice. Sharing to “Service Providers” shall be considered a remission under Mexican law whereby each Service Provider is a data processor and bound by contractual terms restricting use of personal data processed on our behalf. Any “Business Transfers” described in that section are not a communication of data under Mexican law, they are considered an assignment of the data controller obligations to a third party, which shall be communicated to you through the availability of a new privacy policy.

##### _Your Rights under Mexican Privacy Law_

You are entitled to: (i) access to your personal data kept by Learneo (ii); be informed of the treatment given to your personal data by Learneo; (iii) request rectification of your personal data in case the information is incorrect or incomplete; (iv) request cancellation of your personal data; (v) refuse to the treatment of your personal data; and (vi) revoke your consent for the processing of your personal data (together "ARCO Rights").

You may exercise your ARCO rights by contacting Learneo compliance at [\[email protected\]](https://languagetool.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) with the subject "ARCO Rights", and providing the following information:

* Your name and address
* The specific Learneo Service you are using
* Supporting documentation of your domicile in Mexico,
* A clear and precise description of the personal data you are seeking to access or the privacy right you are exercising
* Any additional details relevant to your request.

Command Data is distinct from Your Content, which includes the contents of the email you prepare and receive, chat messages you write (excluding history or chats received), documents you create, search queries, and text you enter in multiline fields on websites you visit. We process Command Data in real time using our machine learning algorithm to generate outputs. After this real-time processing, Your Content is deleted from our Services.

We also collect URLs and usage information (in addition to the usage information described above), such as the number of times you disable/enable the extension on a website. This information helps us understand how you use this service and how we can improve it.

We do not access your contacts, text in single-line fields (which are more likely to contain personal data), or content in fields marked "sensitive," such as credit card, password, email address, or email subject fields.

We only collect Your Content when the QuillBot icon is displayed and enabled, indicating that Your Content will be grammar-checked or paraphrased. We only store Your Content with your consent. You can disable the extension or revoke consent at any time by clicking the QuillBot icon in the top-right corner of your browser and going to "Preferences."

We also collect URLs and usage information when you use QuillBot on a website (in addition to the usage information described immediately above), such as the number of times you disable/enable the extension on a website, which we retain to help us understand how you use this Service and to help us improve it. We only collect Your Content when the QuillBot icon is displayed and enabled, indicating that Your Content will be grammar checked or paraphrased. You can choose to disable the QuillBot extension at any time on the top right corner of your browser. We do not access your contacts, text in single-line input fields (which are more likely to contain personal data), or content in fields marked "sensitive" such as credit card, password, email address or email subject fields.

### _Collected when you use the QuillBot Desktop App_

When you install the QuillBot desktop app, QuillBot will request permission to access your computer's accessibility features. This allows us to collect your inputs from within certain applications on your computer to enable us to provide our Services to you. Your inputs will be used in real time on our machine learning algorithm to generate outputs, after which they are deleted. Access to your accessibility features also allow us to identify apps you use but which are yet to be supported, so we can display a feedback widget. After you grant permissions to your computer's accessibility settings, you can choose when to use the QuillBot desktop app to help improve your writing at any time, by clicking on the QuillBot icon that appears when you open certain compatible apps on your computer.

Payment information, such as card number, is collected and processed directly by our third-party payment processors as noted above.

If you are an Administrator, Editor, or Member, we collect your email address from the Team Plan Owner to send you an invitation to join the Team Plan. To join a Team Plan, you will need to register an account with LanguageTool.

When you register for a Team Plan and use LanguageTool under a managed Team Plan account, we process any personal data we collect as described in the LanguageTool Business Data Processing Agreement available at [https://languagetool.org/legal/dpa](https://languagetool.org/legal/dpa) (“LanguageTool DPA”). For Team Plan customers only, in the event of a conflict between the terms of this Privacy Policy and the LanguageTool DPA, the LanguageTool DPA terms apply.

**Data Retention**
------------------

Except as otherwise permitted or required by applicable law or regulation, LanguageTool retains personal information about you for as long as you have an open account with us, as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for. In some cases, we retain personal information for longer and for other legitimate purposes, including if doing so is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, enforcing and preventing violations of our Terms, to fight spam, protecting or defending our rights, property and users, to resolve disputes or collect fees owed, or is otherwise permitted or required by applicable law, rule or regulation. We may further retain information in an anonymous or aggregated form, where that information would not identify you personally. Applicable storage periods are determined on a case-by-case basis. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal information, we consider applicable legal requirements, the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes we process your personal information for, and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means. For example, we retain account information like your account email address for as long as your account is in existence, because we need it to operate your account.

Deleting Your LanguageTool Account
----------------------------------

If you would like to delete your LanguageTool account, you can do this directly by going to "My Account" in "Settings.” If you choose to delete your account: (1) all of your account information will be deleted from LanguageTool, 2) all your uploaded text, documents and order details will be deleted automatically; this is irrevocable, and you can never use or enter this account again; 3) we will no longer have access to your documents. This means we cannot deal with possible complaints, as we cannot address complaints from deleted accounts.

If the GDPR, US State privacy laws, or other privacy law grants you the right to have your personal data deleted entirely from LanguageTool and you want to exercise that right (or any other privacy right), please read Part One of this policy for how to submit your request.
