1. General information and legal basis
    -----------------------------------
    
    The following statement informs you about what kind of personal data is collected for what purpose on this website by us as the responsible party and to what extent this data is made available to third parties.
    
    1. ### Controller
        
        _LanguageTooler GmbH_  
        Karl-Liebknecht-Str. 37  
        14482 Potsdam (Germany)
        
        #### Data Protection Officer
        
        _Barbara von dem Bussche_  
        DP Dock DPO Services GmbH  
        Grüffkamp 10

        Germany  
        E-Mail: [\[email protected\]](https://languagetool.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)
        
    2. ### Legal bases of the processing
        
        The processing of personal data requires a legal basis, which we would like to present to you below.
        
        For processing of personal data for which we obtain the consent of the data subject, Article 6(1)(a) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) serves as the legal basis.
        
        When processing personal data that is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, Article 6(1)(b) GDPR serves as the legal basis. This also includes processing operations that are necessary for the performance of pre-contractual measures.
        
        Insofar as the processing of personal data is necessary for the fulfillment of a legal obligation to which our company is subject, Article 6 (1) lit. c GDPR serves as the legal basis.
        
        If the processing is necessary to protect a legitimate interest of our company or a third party and the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not override the former interest, Article 6 (1) lit. f GDPR serves as the legal basis for the processing. The legitimate interest of our company lies in the performance of our business activities as well as in the analysis, optimization and maintenance of the security of our online offer.
        
2. Log files, hosting
    ------------------
    
    In the server statistics, data is automatically stored that the browser transmits to us as part of our legitimate interest in analysis and for security reasons (so-called "log files").
    
    In detail, these are the following data:
    
    * Language and version of the browser software
    * Operating system used and its interface
    * Referrer URL (the previously visited page)
    * Host name of the accessing computer (IP address)
    * Date and time of the server request
    * Time zone difference from Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)
    * name of the requested page
    * Data volume transferred
    * Access status/ HTTP status code.
    
    As a rule, we cannot assign this data to specific persons. A combination of this data with other data sources is not made. The data is also deleted within 14 days after a statistical evaluation. Data whose further retention is required for evidentiary purposes is exempt from deletion until the respective incident has been finally clarified.
    
    We make use of hosting services. These serve to provide infrastructure and platform services, computing capacity, storage space and database services, security services and technical maintenance services to maintain the operation of this online offer.
    
    In doing so, we or our hosting provider process inventory data, contact data, content data, contract data, usage data, meta data and communication data of customers, interested parties and visitors of this online offer on the basis of our legitimate interests in an efficient and secure provision of this online offer.
    
3. Contractual processing, use of our software
    -------------------------------------------
    
    1. ### General
        
        When you enter into a contractual relationship with us, we usually collect the data you provide, such as: First and last name, e-mail address, address, telephone / mobile phone number, information that is necessary for the execution of the contract.
        
        We need this data so that we can identify you as a contractual partner, execute the contract, contact you and for billing purposes. The data processing is carried out on your / our request or order and is necessary for the stated purposes for the mutual performance and obligation arising from the contractual relationship.
        
        We may also process data on the basis of a legitimate interest, e.g. when asserting or defending claims arising from the contractual relationship. The collected personal data will be stored until the expiry of the contractual relationship and then deleted, unless we are obliged to store it for a longer period of time in accordance with legal obligations due to tax and commercial law retention and documentation obligations (from HGB, StGB or AO).
        
        The **"Statistics"** function is available for our following services: Homepage, LanguageTool Editor, Browser Add-ons, Desktop Apps
        
        This statistical data is only collected for logged-in users and contains evaluations of spelling mistakes, grammatical errors, writing activities, etc. The statistics can only be viewed within the scope of the respective account. To enable you to use this function and to protect your privacy, we do not store your texts, but only aggregated usage figures (e.g. number of words and error corrections) for at least 12 months. Deletion takes place at the latest when the account is deleted or at your request. The collection of statistics can be disabled in the account settings.
        
    2. ### Software LanguageTool
        
        1. #### Special privacy policy for the LanguageTool homepage and our add-ons
            
            Your texts sent for review via our add-ons are not saved, with the following exceptions:
            
            * If you use our online editor at [https://languagetool.org/editor](https://languagetool.org/editor) or our desktop apps, see section b.)
            * If you use our "Rephrasing" feature, see section c.)
            * If you explicitly ignore correction suggestions, we anonymously store the internal ID of this error rule and the text fragment underlined as incorrect and 15 characters to the right and left of it. This allows us to detect false alarms from our system and avoid them in the future.
            * If you accept correction suggestions, we anonymously store the internal ID of this error rule (e.g. EN\_A\_VS\_AN for the rule that finds a/an confusions).
            * In the very rare case of an internal software error (so-called "exception"), we anonymously store the record that triggered the error so that we can find the cause and correct the error. These records are stored anonymously for up to 14 days.
            * To improve the speed of our software, we store checked records and the errors found in them for up to 15 minutes on our servers in the main memory (not on a permanent storage medium). The storage is done without IP address or other information that would allow the records to be assigned to a person.
            
            To improve the quality and availability of our system, we also store the following information:
            
            * Date and time, length of the text, language of the text (but not the checked text itself), duration of processing, number and type of errors detected (e.g. "capitalization at the beginning of a sentence", "confusion of 'this is an Example' and 'This is an Example'"),
            * The page from which the request was sent (e.g. languagetool.org),
            * Add-on version; date of installation; random ID of the text field whose text is checked. Password fields are ignored by the add-on and are not transmitted to our servers.
            * Only in the case of a browser add-on uninstallation, the following is transmitted: the number of times the add-on was used and the URL of the page where the add-on was last used. This allows us to determine which pages do not work correctly with our add-on.
            * Only if you have an account on languagetool.org and if you are logged into the add-on with that account: The add-on contacts our servers periodically (about once a day) to let us know that you are an active user. This includes your browser (e.g. Firefox) and your email address (which we already know because you already have an account on our system). This allows us to track user activity and improve our software.
        2. #### Special data protection information for the LanguageTool Editor
            
            For our editor at [languagetool.org/editor](https://languagetool.org/editor) and the editor integration in our apps for Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS, the following applies in addition to the other notices in this privacy policy:
            
            When you use our editor, the texts you edit there are saved so you can access them in the future. To protect you from accidentally deleting your documents, documents are first moved to the Recycle Bin when they are deleted. They are not permanently removed from our system until they are also deleted from the Recycle Bin.
            
            The storage takes place on servers in Germany at Amazon Web Services EMEA SARL, Niederlassung Deutschland, Marcel-Breuer-Str. 12, 80807 Munich, Germany.
            
            To improve our services, we use stored texts for machine learning in this context. Machine learning is used in particular to improve the text checking and paraphrasing functions. The machine learning takes place on servers of Google Ireland Ltd within the EU.
            
            The legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 b) or Art. 6 para. 1 a) GDPR). Your data will be deleted as soon as you delete your user account.
            
            A user account is required to use the editor so that your texts can be assigned to you.
            
            LanguageTool Enterprise customers (team accounts) can disable the storage of data for machine learning.
            
        3. #### Special privacy notices for the "Rephrasing" feature
            
            For some languages, our synonym function offers the possibility to generate wording suggestions for your sentence. Some of these suggestions come from our service provider OpenAI (OpenAI L.L.C., 3180 18th Street, San Francisco, CA 94110, USA) and/or Aleph Alpha (Aleph Alpha GmbH, Grenzhöfer Weg 36, 69123 Heidelberg, Germany). In order to generate the suggestions, we must send the particular sentence to OpenAI and Aleph Alpha for processing. OpenAI reserves the right to store this data. For details, please see the Terms of Use at: [https://openai.com/api/policies/terms/](https://openai.com/api/policies/terms/) and the Privacy Policy at: [https://openai.com/api/policies/privacy/](https://openai.com/api/policies/privacy/) of OpenAI and [https://www.aleph-alpha.com/privacy-policy](https://www.aleph-alpha.com/privacy-policy) of Aleph Alpha. The legal basis is your consent. EU standard contractual clauses have been agreed with OpenAI, which ensure the transfer of data under appropriate safeguards in accordance with Art. 46 GDPR. To improve our services in this context, we anonymously use the sentence for which you create variations and your selection of our variation for machine learning. Machine learning is used in particular to improve the functions for text checking and reformulation.
            
            LanguageTool Enterprise customers (team accounts) can disable the storage of data for machine learning.
            
4. Contact, application data
    -------------------------
    
    1. ### Contact
        
        When you contact us, e.g. by e-mail, your details will be stored by us in order to answer your questions.
        
        As a matter of principle, data will not be passed on to third parties unless applicable data protection regulations justify a transfer or we are legally obliged to do so. You can revoke your consent at any time with effect for the future. In the event of revocation, your data will be deleted immediately, unless there is a legal exception for further processing. Your data will otherwise be deleted when we have processed your request or the purpose of storage has ceased to apply and there are no other legal exceptions to the contrary.
        
    2. ### Application data
        
        You can also apply to us, e.g. via our contact form. We process the data you have sent us in connection with your application in order to check your suitability for the position and to carry out the application process. Please note that your data will be accessible to our HR department and to the departments relevant to the position to be filled. We wish to consider all applications on the basis of qualifications only, regardless of race, ethnic origin, gender, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual identity. We therefore ask that you refrain from providing such information in your application if at all possible. The legal basis for the processing of your personal data in application procedures is Section 26 BDSG or Article 6 (1) b) GDPR. According to this, the processing of data required in connection with the decision on the establishment of an employment relationship is permissible. If the data should be required for legal prosecution after completion of the application process, data processing may be carried out on the basis of the requirements under Art. 6 (1) f) GDPR, in order to safeguard legitimate interests. Our interest then consists in the assertion or defense of claims.
        
        Data of applicants will be deleted after 6 months at the latest in case of rejection. In the event that you have agreed to further storage of your personal data, we will transfer your data to our applicant pool. There, the data will be deleted after two years. If you have been awarded a position during the application process, the data will be stored permanently for the purpose of implementing the employment relationship. You can have your application changed or deleted at any time and revoke any consent you may have given at any time.
        
    3. ### Cookies

5. Newsletter
    ----------
    
    If you would like to receive the newsletter offered on our website, we need a valid e-mail address from you that allows us to verify that you are the owner of the specified e-mail address or that the owner agrees to receive the newsletter.
    
    After providing the e-mail address, we will send you a confirmation e-mail to the address provided, in which we ask you to confirm that you wish to receive the newsletter. If you do not confirm this within 24 hours, your data relating to the newsletter dispatch will be automatically deleted. If you confirm your wish to receive the newsletter, we will store your e-mail address until you unsubscribe from the newsletter.
    
    We send newsletters only with your consent or legal permission.
    
      
    
    The dispatch of the newsletter takes place by means of the following service providers:
    
    * Mailjet SAS, 13 - 13 bis Rue de l'Aubrac, 75012 Paris
    * SendGrid, Inc, 1801 California Street, Suite 500, Denver, CO 80202, USA.

Details can be found at [https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360051805394-Measures-Twilio-Takes-to-Safeguard-the-Privacy-of-Customer-Personal-Data](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/360051805394-Measures-Twilio-Takes-to-Safeguard-the-Privacy-of-Customer-Personal-Data) (SendGrid is a subsidiary of Twilio).
    
    You can revoke your consent to the storage of the data, the e-mail address and their use for sending the newsletter at any time. You will find a link to cancel the newsletter at the end of each newsletter. If users have only subscribed to the newsletter and cancelled this subscription, their personal data will be deleted.
    
6. Registration
    ------------
    
    Our website offers a registration option. The personal data entered during registration will be transmitted to the controller. The data is stored exclusively for internal use by us.
    
    During registration, the IP address of the user and the date and time of registration are stored. This serves to prevent misuse of the services. The data will not be passed on to third parties. An exception exists if there is a legal obligation to pass on the data.
    
    The registration of data is necessary for the provision of content or services. Registered persons have the possibility to have the stored data deleted or modified at any time. The data subject will receive information about the personal data stored about him at any time.
    
    When you sign in to the Services using data stored with a third party (e.g., Facebook, Google, or Apple), you allow us to collect your authentication data, such as usernames, as encrypted credentials. We may also collect other data associated with your account with a third party service provider. This includes, but is not limited to, your name, profile picture, country, city, email address, date of birth, gender, the names and profile pictures of your friends and networks, provided you have given your consent here with login.
    
7. Our social media presences
    --------------------------
    
    You can find us under online presences within social networks and platforms. With these presences, we would like to communicate with our customers, interested parties and users active there and inform them about our services and our company in this way.
    
    The processing of the personal data of the users active there is based on our legitimate interests in communicating and providing information to and with the users. If users have given their consent to data processing within the framework of the respective social platform, the processing is carried out on the basis of this consent.
    
    If you visit one of our social media sites, we are jointly responsible with the operator of the social platform for the data processing operations triggered during this visit. In principle, you can assert your rights (information, correction, deletion, restriction of processing, data portability and complaint, see the following point "Rights of the data subject") both against us and against the operator of the respective social platform.
    
    We would like to point out that despite the joint responsibility, we do not have full influence on the data processing operations of the social platform and, if necessary, forward the rights request to the respective operator for better processing of the data subject rights. Our options are basically based on the corporate policy of the respective provider.
    
    You can find our storage details below. We have no influence on the storage period of your data, which is stored by the operator of the social platform for its own purposes. For details, please contact the operators of the social networks directly (e.g. in their privacy policy, see below).
    
    Depending on the following named social platform, the data processing of users may also take place outside the area of the European Union. EU standard contractual clauses have been agreed with the US companies, or they are certified under the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) so that we have taken possible measures to ensure compliance with European data protection law.
    
      
    
    As a rule, user data is processed by the platforms for market research and advertising purposes. For example, usage profiles can be created from the usage behavior and resulting interests of the users. The usage profiles can in turn be used, for example, to place advertisements within and outside the platforms that presumably correspond to the interests of the users. For this purpose, cookies are usually stored on the users' computers, in which the usage behavior and the interests of the users are stored. Data can also be stored in the usage profiles regardless of the devices used by the users. This occurs in particular if the users are members of the respective platforms and are logged in to them.
    
    For a detailed presentation of the respective processing and the objection options, we refer to the information of the providers linked below.

8. Disclosure of data to third parties: General and contractual purpose
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    We pass on data to third parties if this is necessary for the fulfillment of the contract and / or we are legally obligated and / or authorized to do so in individual cases.
    
    1. ### Payment service provider: PayPal
        
        If you choose to pay with the online payment service provider PayPal during your order process, your contact details will be transmitted to PayPal through the triggered order. PayPal is an offer of PayPal (Europe) S.à.r.l. & Cie. S.C.A., 22-24 Boulevard Royal, L-2449 Luxembourg. PayPal assumes the function of an online payment service provider as well as a trustee and offers buyer protection services.
        
        The personal data transmitted to PayPal is data that is required for order processing, as well as data related to the order, such as number of items, item number, invoice amount.
        
        This transmission is necessary to process your order with the payment method you have selected, in particular to confirm your identity, to administer your payment and the customer relationship.
        
        Depending on the payment method selected via PayPal, e.g. invoice or direct debit, the personal data transmitted to PayPal will be transmitted by PayPal to credit agencies. This transmission serves to check your identity and creditworthiness in relation to the order you have placed. You can find out which credit agencies are involved and which data is generally collected, processed, stored and passed on by PayPal in the PayPal data protection declaration at [https://www.paypal.com/de/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full](https://www.paypal.com/de/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full).
        
    2. ### Payment service: Recurly
        
        We use Recurly (Recurly, Inc., 400 Alabama St, Suite 202, San Francisco, California 94110, USA) to manage subscriptions. Recurly is a platform for managing subscriptions and creating invoices. For this purpose, Recurly - if you use our premium offer - processes, among other things, your name, address and the payment information provided.
        
        Recurly is certified under the Data Privacy Framework, so possible measures have been taken to ensure compliance with European data protection law. For more information on data privacy at Recurly, please visit [https://recurly.com/legal/privacy/](https://recurly.com/legal/privacy/).
        
    3. ### Payment service: Stripe
        
        We use Stripe, a service of the American company Stripe Inc., 185 Berry Street, Suite 550, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA (hereinafter "Stripe") to process payments via our website.
        
        Stripe is certified under the Data Privacy Framework, so possible measures have been taken to ensure compliance with European data protection law.
        
        In particular, Stripe has published the following information on the nature, scope and purpose of data processing in its privacy policy: [https://stripe.com/de/privacy#translation](https://stripe.com/de/privacy#translation)
        
        Through Stripe it is possible to offer various payment methods, such as credit card payments or direct debit. In this context, Stripe offers software interfaces to integrate these payment methods with us. The crediting of a payment transaction then takes place for us via a so-called Stripe account.
        
        If you make a payment via our platform, data of the data subject is automatically transmitted to Stripe. By selecting this payment option, the data subject consents to the transmission of personal data required for payment processing.
        
        The personal data transmitted to Stripe are usually first name, last name, address, email address, IP address, telephone number, cell phone number or other data as well as financial transaction data, such as credit card number or account data, which are necessary for payment processing. Also necessary for the processing of the contract are such personal data that are related to the respective service.
        
        The purpose of the data transfer is payment processing and fraud prevention. The personal data exchanged between Stripe and us may be transmitted by Stripe to credit reporting agencies. This transmission is for the purpose of checking identity and creditworthiness within the scope of our legitimate interest.
        
        Stripe may disclose the personal data to affiliated companies and service providers or subcontractors to the extent necessary to fulfill its contractual obligations or to process the data on its behalf.

        2. #### Facebook Custom Audiences and Website Custom Audiences
            
            Our website uses the advertising tools Custom Audiences and Website Custom Audiences from Facebook. Here, a non-reversible and non-personal checksum (hash value) is generated from your usage data, which is transmitted to Facebook for analysis and marketing purposes on its social platform and stored in the USA.
            
            The Facebook pixel is directly integrated by Facebook when you call up our websites and can save a so-called cookie, i.e. a small file, on your device. If you subsequently log in to Facebook or visit Facebook while logged in, your visit to our online offering will be noted in your profile. The data collected about you is anonymous for us, so it does not offer us any conclusions about the identity of the user. However, the data is stored and processed by Facebook, so that a connection to the respective user profile is possible and can be used by Facebook and for its own market research and advertising purposes. If we should transmit data to Facebook for matching purposes, this data is encrypted locally in on the browser and only then sent to Facebook via a secure https connection. This is done solely for the purpose of creating a comparison with the data encrypted in the same way by Facebook.
            
            Furthermore, when using the Facebook Pixel, we use the additional function "extended matching" (in this case, data such as telephone numbers, email addresses or Facebook IDs of the users) to create target groups ("Custom Audiences" or "Look Alike Audiences") are transmitted to Facebook (encrypted). Further information on "advanced matching": [https://www.facebook.com/business/help/611774685654668](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/611774685654668).

        On this website, the "TikTok Pixel" of the social network TikTok, which is operated by TikTok Technology Limited, 10 Earlsfort Terrace, Dublin, D02 T380, Ireland ("TikTok"), is used in accordance with your consent.
        
        With the help of the TikTok pixel, it is possible for TikTok, on the one hand, to determine you as a visitor to our online presence as a target group for the display of advertisements (so-called "TikTok ads"). We thus use the TikTok pixel to display the TikTok ads created by us only to those TikTok users who have also shown an interest in our online presence or who have certain characteristics (e.g. interests in certain topics or products determined on the basis of the websites visited) that we transmit to TikTok (so-called "Custom Audiences"). With the help of the TikTok pixel, we also want to ensure that our TikTok ads correspond to the potential interest of users and are not harassing. The TikTok pixel also allows us to track the effectiveness of the TikTok ads for statistical and market research purposes by seeing whether users were redirected to our website after clicking on a TikTok ad (so-called "conversion"). For specific information and details about the TikTok pixel and how it works, please see the TikTok help section. You can object to the collection by the TikTok pixel and use of your data to display TikTok ads.

        Reddit places a cookie on your computer if you have reached our website via a Reddit ad. These cookies expire after 30 days and are not used for personal identification. If you visit certain pages of a Reddit Ads customer's website and the cookie has not yet expired, Reddit and the customer can recognize that you clicked on the ad and were redirected to that page. Because each Reddit Ads customer receives a different cookie, they cannot be tracked across Reddit Ads customers' websites. The information obtained using the conversion cookie is used to create conversion statistics for Reddit Ads customers who have opted in to conversion tracking. Reddit Ads customers learn the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a page tagged with a conversion tracking tag. However, we do not receive any information that personally identifies users.

        In this process, Bing Ads technologies are used to collect and store data from which usage profiles are created using pseudonyms. This service enables us to track the activities of users on our website if they have reached our website via ads from Bing Ads. If you arrive at our website via such an ad, a cookie is set on your computer. A Bing UET tag is integrated on our website. This is a code that, in conjunction with the cookie, stores some non-personal data about the use of the website. This includes, among other things, the length of time spent on the website, which areas of the website were accessed and via which ad the users arrived at the website. Information about your identity is not collected. The information collected is transferred to Microsoft servers in the USA and stored there for a maximum of 180 days.

10. Data storage outside the EU/EEA
    -------------------------------
    
    Where recognizable in the individual tool descriptions, we use tools from US third-party providers. Insofar as this is necessary for the notified purposes, it may happen that your IP address is processed in this course outside the European Economic Area, where a level of data protection corresponding to the European standard is not always consistently ensured and confirmed (for example, by appropriate guarantee within the meaning of Art. 46 GDPR or an adequacy decision of the European Commission). Therefore, it cannot be ruled out in particular that security authorities in a third country may gain access to your IP address without you being able to take legally effective action against them.
    
    The transfer of the IP address to these third-party providers takes place in accordance with Art. 49 (1) lit. a GDPR on the basis of your consent expressly given for this purpose in the consent banner. This consent is voluntary. You can revoke it at any time with effect for the future. You will not suffer any disadvantages as a result.
    
    In the opinion of some U.S. third-party providers, a level of protection equivalent to the European standard is already guaranteed due to the conclusion of so-called standard contractual clauses as well as additional measures taken in the sense of the Schrems II case law. However, since the suitability of such measures to ensure a sufficient level of data protection is disputed, we have decided to transfer your IP address only with your consent.
    
    The certification of some companies under the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) serves to ensure the level of protection and can be queried here for the companies: [https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/s/). This certification is sufficient as measures to ensure a sufficient level of data protection.
    
11. Rights of the data subject
    --------------------------
    
    You have a right to information about the personal data stored by us about you. According to the legal provisions, you also have the right to correct incorrect data, restriction of processing, data portability and deletion of your personal data. To do so, send us an e-mail with the subject "Data protection". You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection supervisory authority if you are of the opinion that processing of personal data concerning you violates legal provisions.
    
    For reasons arising from your particular situation, you may object at any time to the processing of personal data relating to you by us that is carried out on the basis of Article 6 (1) (e) or (f); this also applies to profiling based on these provisions (Article 21 GDPR). If the legal requirements are met, we will subsequently no longer process your personal data.
    
    In the case of direct marketing, you have the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data concerning you for the purpose of such marketing; this also applies to profiling, insofar as it is related to such direct marketing. Your objection will have the effect that the personal data will no longer be processed for these purposes.
    
    If you have given your consent, you have the right to revoke your consent at any time. This does not affect the lawfulness of the processing carried out on the basis of the consent until the revocation.
    
12. Storage period of the personal data
    -----------------------------------
    
    If we have not provided storage information on the specific points, the following applies: We store personal data for the duration of the respective statutory retention period or as long as the purpose of the collection exists. After expiry of the retention period, the data is routinely deleted, unless it is necessary for the initiation or performance of a contract. If user data is not deleted because it is required for other and legally permissible purposes, its processing will be restricted as far as possible. Accordingly, the data will be blocked if possible and not processed for other purposes. This applies, for example, to user data that must be retained for reasons of commercial or tax law.
    
13. Safety information
    ------------------
    
    We make every effort to process your personal data by taking all technical and organizational possibilities to comply with the provisions of data protection laws and thus to protect this data. Our website or the communication via our website with us is encrypted via HTTPS.
