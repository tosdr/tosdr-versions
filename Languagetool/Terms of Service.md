=========================================

Effective Date: December 19, 2024

Previous LanguageTool General Terms and Conditions ([available here](https://languagetool.org/legal/terms?old=true)).

Scope
-----

These terms and conditions, along with all the policies and guidelines referenced herein (collectively, the “**General Terms and Conditions**” or the “**LanguageTool Service Terms**”), form a part of the binding legal agreement between you, the user (“**you**” or “**your**”), and LanguageTool, a Learneo, Inc. business, Karl-Liebknecht-Straße 37, 14482 Potsdam, Germany (”**LanguageTool**”, “**we**”, “**our**”, “**us**”, or “**provider**”), and govern your use of LanguageTool’s services, including this website and all features, mobile applications, websites, extensions, widgets, technologies, software, and other products and services provided by LanguageTool (collectively, the “**LanguageTool Services**”).

These General Terms and Conditions incorporate by reference the [Learneo Terms of Service](https://www.learneo.com/legal/eu-terms-of-service) (the “**Learneo Terms of Service**”). Any capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meaning given in the Learneo Terms of Service. In the event there is a conflict between these General Terms and Conditions and the Learneo Terms of Service, these General Terms and Conditions will control with respect to the LanguageTool Services only.

**By registering for and/or accessing, browsing, using, or subscribing to the LanguageTool services, or by clicking “I agree” or otherwise affirmatively manifesting your intent to agree and be bound by these general terms and conditions, you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these general terms and conditions. If you do not agree to these general terms and conditions, you may not access or use the LanguageTool services.**

If you are a business customer who signed a separate services agreement for your use of the LanguageTool Services, these General Terms and Conditions do not apply to you, and your separate services agreement will govern your use of the LanguageTool Services.

Subject to applicable law, we reserve the right to amend these General Terms and Conditions at any time in accordance with Section I of the Learneo Terms of Service by posting a version of them to [languagetool.org/legal/terms](https://languagetool.org/legal/terms). Where required by applicable law, we will provide requisite notice of the amendments and/or ask for your consent to the amended terms.

The LanguageTool Services
-------------------------

The LanguageTool Services include both paid (“**Premium Services**”) and free versions, for which no additional fees are charged (“**Free Services**”). Some of the Free Services are accessible without a User Account.

To use certain features of the LanguageTool Services, you may be required to create a User Account by providing the information set out in our [Privacy Policy](https://languagetool.org/legal/privacy). You are responsible for providing correct, current, and complete information and maintaining the accuracy of such information. If we have reasonable grounds to suspect that the information used to create your User Account is untrue, inaccurate, not current, or incomplete, we may suspend or terminate your access to and use of the LanguageTool Services (or any portion thereof). You must maintain the security of your User Account and immediately notify us if you discover or suspect that someone has accessed your User Account without your permission. We cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage that arises from your failure to comply with this section.

We reserve the right to make updates or release new versions of the software used as part of the LanguageTool Services without prior notice to you. We also reserve the right to restrict, discontinue, extend, or change the whole or part of the Free Services at any time without notice to you.

Premium Services
----------------

In order to enter into an agreement and use the Premium Services, you must create a User Account (or log in if you already have one) and provide us with a current, accurate, and acceptable payment method (such as a debit card, credit card, or SEPA) (“**Payment Method**”). When you click the “check out” (or other words of similar import) button and subscribe to the Premium Services, you will be making a binding offer to enter into an agreement.

If you choose to subscribe to the Premium Services, you agree to pay the prices shown to you for the Premium Services you have selected, as well as any applicable sales or similar taxes (the “**Fees**”), and you authorize us to charge the Payment Method you have provided. If you purchase an automatically renewing subscription and do not cancel it as specified below, your initial subscription will automatically and continuously renew at the end of the initial subscription term in the manner disclosed to you prior to your purchase. You authorize us to charge your Payment Method for recurring Fees on an ongoing basis in accordance with your designated payment schedule.

You can cancel your subscription to a Premium Service at any time in your User Account’s [account settings page](https://languagetool.org/user-login). Unless otherwise communicated to you, your subscription benefits will continue if you cancel your subscription until the end of your then-current subscription term, but your subscription will not renew after that term expires. Please see [here](https://help.languagetool.com/en/support/solutions/articles/44001934233-how-can-i-cancel-my-subscription-) for additional information and guidance on how to cancel a subscription.

All Fees are nonrefundable, and there will be no refunds or credits for any partially used Premium Services (including for partially used subscription terms), except as otherwise provided in writing herein or at the time of your initial purchase of the Premium Services, in the Learneo Terms of Service, or as required by applicable law. These terms do not override any mandatory local laws regarding your cancellation or refund rights.

Additional Terms applicable to LanguageTool Team Plan Subscribers
-----------------------------------------------------------------

These additional terms (“**Team Plan Terms**”) apply if you purchase a team plan from LanguageTool (“**Team Plan**”) or use the LanguageTool Services under a Team Plan. For purposes of this section, “**Owner**” refers to the creator and purchaser of a Team Plan, “**Members**” refer to multiple individual users who are authorized and invited by Owner or an Administrator (defined below) to simultaneously access the benefits of the Language Services under the Team Plan, “**Editors**” refer to Members that have been granted permission to edit Team Plan features, and “**Administrators**” refer to Editors that have been granted permission by the Owner to add or remove Members.

These Team Plan Terms are binding and effective on the date Owner, Members, Editors, or Administrators begin using the Team Plan. If at any point the Owner transfers ownership of the Team Plan to a new account Owner, by accessing and using the Team Plan account, the new Team Plan Owner hereby agrees to be bound by these Team Plan Terms.

**Use of Team Plan.**

Acceptable Use. LanguageTool Services offered under the Team Plan are always subject to the General Terms and Conditions.

Owner Responsibility. Owner of a Team Plan is responsible for:

The use of the LanguageTool Services under the Team Plan by any Member, Editor, Administrator, and any new Member invited by the Owner or an Administrator; and

Maintaining the confidentiality of any non-public authentication credentials associated with a Member’s, Editor’s, or Administrator’s use of the Team Plan. Owner must promptly notify our customer support team about any possible misuse of the accounts or authentication credentials, or any security incident related to the Team Plan.

Maximum Number of Team Plan Users. Owner acknowledges and agrees that the maximum number of concurrent Members, Editors, or Administrators who access or otherwise use the LanguageTool Services under the Team Plan shall not exceed the permitted number of Members, Editors, Administrators, or other limits imposed by us, if any, at the time. Fees and conditions apply if the Owner wants to add additional Members to the Team Plan.

**Effective Date, Term, and Renewal Term.** The effective date for your Team Plan subscription will be the date, as confirmed by us, of the Owner's purchase of the Team Plan and shall continue until terminated as specified below. Subject to applicable law, Team Plan subscriptions will be billed recurring Fees on an ongoing basis in accordance with the designated payment schedule of the applicable Team Plan.

**Member Account Termination and Team Plan Termination.**

Member Account Termination. Access to a Member account under the Team Plan may be removed by the Owner or an Administrator at any time. A Member may terminate their Team Plan account by removal from the Owner, an Administrator, or by directly contacting our customer service team.

Team Plan Termination. A Team Plan may be terminated at any time by the Owner in the Owner's account page or by contacting our customer service team directly. When the Team Plan is terminated, all accounts under the Team Plan will be downgraded from a premium account to a free account.

Pausing Your Team Plan. A Team Plan subscription cannot be paused. Member accounts within a Team Plan subscription cannot be paused.

Transferring Member Account(s). A Member cannot transfer their Team Plan account to a third party. Only the Owner and an Administrator can add or remove Members from the Team Plan.

**LanguageTool Rights.**

Verification. We reserve the right, but shall have no obligation, to verify that Members have been authorized and verified by the Owner or an Administrator and to restrict access to the LanguageTool Services if, in our reasonable judgment and in our own discretion, a Member cannot be verified. We reserve the right to investigate any violation or potential violation of the General Terms and Conditions or in cases of suspected fraud.

Suspension. We may suspend all accounts under the Team Plan if:

Owner, or any Members, including any Editors and Administrators, use of the LanguageTool Services poses a risk to the LanguageTool Services, us (including, but not limited to, our infrastructure, security, and third-party relationships), or our other users or customers;

Owner or any Team Plan users, including any Editors and Administrators, use the LanguageTool Services in a manner that could subject us to liability;

Owner's payment of the Fees of the Team Plan is late; or

Owner or any Team Plan users, including any Editors and Administrators, are otherwise in breach of the General Terms and Conditions (including these Team Plan Terms), or in cases of suspected fraud.

We will provide the owner with prompt notice of any suspension.
