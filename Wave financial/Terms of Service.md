Terms of Use Agreement
======================

Terms of Use Agreement
======================

Effective as of: January 29, 2024

Hey there! We’re making some updates to this agreement. We encourage you to read and familiarize yourself with the [updated agreement](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62446230dcb514b828a6e237/659c0bdb43c50df0551f9dd0_Terms%20of%20Use%20-%20January%2029%2C%202024.pdf), which takes effect on January 25, 2024. After that date, you will be prompted in-app to agree to the updates to continue using Wave.  
  
Summary of key changes:

* Security & Privacy - We’ve added a new section to compile all the information related to these topics, like cardholder data requirements. Don’t worry, nothing about how we use your data has changed.
* Additional Terms - We now direct customers to our [Legal Disclosures](https://www.waveapps.com/legal/legal-disclosures) page rather than listing every additional agreement we have in these terms.

A note from Wave:

Hi! Thank you for reviewing this Terms of Use Agreement (“Agreement,” as further defined below). We applaud you. You must agree to this Agreement if you’re going to use the Wave website or any of the Wave services we offer here at the Wave website or through our mobile applications. Our lawyers wrote the Agreement and that’s the language that counts. We’ve also provided some simplified wording to summarize some of the key points, but please remember that the Agreement itself is what is legally binding. Thanks for joining the Wave community!
