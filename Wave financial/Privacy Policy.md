Terms of Service – Wave Receipts
================================

Your Security

Your Security
=============

Effective as of: June 8, 2023

Hi! Congratulations on being the sort of person who reads legal terms of service. Below, you’ll see the terms you’re agreeing to when you use Wave’s receipt scan feature. Thanks for joining the Wave community!

When it comes to keeping your data and your money safe, we never rest. We’ve built bank-grade security measures into our systems to make sure you can use Wave with confidence.

**Data Security**
-----------------

**  
PCI-DSS Certified:** Wave is [Level 1 PCI-DSS certified](https://www.visa.com/splisting/viewSPDetail.do?spId=2829&coName=Wave%20Financial%20USA%20Inc.&HeadCountryList=UNITED%20STATES%20OF%20AMERICA&reset=yes&pageInfo=1%3B30%3BASC%3BcoName). This means that every year we have a third-party audit to validate our practices and make sure we’re doing the right things for you and your customers.  

**Secure data transmission:** When you load a page in your browser, or upload information to Wave, all that information is encrypted while it’s moving over the internet. We secure your data via encryption.

**Secure data storage:** Your accounting data is stored on servers that have strict physical access and technical controls, meaning there are rules in place limiting access to only the people who need it to do their jobs. The facilities are monitored 24/7 and access to your information is strictly controlled.  
‍

Mobile Security
---------------

  
Passwords are encrypted when they’re collected and when they’re sent to our servers. We don't store them without encrypting them first. In fact, all communications between our apps and our servers are encrypted using security protocols.

Do you have additional questions about the security of Wave? Please [contact us](mailto:security@waveapps.com). We’d be happy to tell you more about the many steps we take to ensure the security of your sensitive information.

**Overview of this Agreement**
------------------------------

Your use of the Subscription Service constitutes your agreement to all terms and conditions of this Agreement. This Agreement includes a binding mutual arbitration provision, which requires that disputes be resolved through individual arbitration.

YYou confirm you have reviewed [Wave’s Terms of Use](https://my.waveapps.com/terms/) (“Wave TOU”) which is incorporated by this reference into and forms part of this Agreement, and you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of the Wave TOU.

#### **4\. Additional Users**

If you authorize additional users (“Additional Users”) to access and use certain parts of Wave on your behalf, they will have access to your account information and may have the ability to perform various tasks depending on the granted access level.

### **D. Subscriptions and Billing**  

The Subscription Service is offered on a per-business subscription basis, billed monthly or annually. Only Account owners can authorize subscriptions. Subscriptions are limited to one business entity (such as your corporation or limited liability company) and are non-transferable. 

The billing period begins on the day that the subscription is purchased and will continue to renew on this day as set out below. The renewal date (“Renewal Date”) is defined as the first day of the billing period and is based on the length of the plan.

* ‍**Monthly Subscription:** Each month, on your Renewal Date, you will be billed for the current month’s subscription fee.
* **Annual Subscription:** Each year, on your Renewal Date, you will be billed for the current year’s subscription fee.

  
For example, if you purchase a one (1) month subscription on February 22nd, your Renewal Date will be March 22nd.

Subscriptions will auto-renew until you choose to cancel. You can cancel your subscription up until one (1) day before your Renewal Date through Wave, Apple, or Google (depending on your subscription method).

#### In simple Terms

This is where you’ll find all of the juicy details related to our subscription plans. You can choose between a monthly or annual plan. Renewals will be automatic unless you cancel through Wave, Apple, or Google as required in this Agreement.

#### **1\. Fees**

At the time of your purchase, Wave will provide the Subscription Service to you at the then current rates and fees (“Fees”) described on our [Pricing Page](https://www.waveapps.com/pricing) (plus applicable taxes), which is incorporated into this Agreement. Wave reserves the right to modify this page and our fees at any time and you agree, unless otherwise notified in writing by Wave, to be bound by the current published version of the fees. Remember to check back and review the [Pricing Page](https://www.waveapps.com/pricing) periodically so you know of any changes. Wave will make commercially reasonable efforts to notify you of any change in fees at least thirty (30) days in advance of the effective date. Your continued use of the Subscription Service constitutes your agreement to those changes. If a fee increase or change to this Agreement is not acceptable, you may cancel the Subscription Service as provided in Section D.3 (Cancellation) prior to the time when it takes effect.

#### In simple Terms

The fees are outlined on our [website](https://www.waveapps.com/pricing) and are subject to change. Using the Subscription Service means you accept the change and you agree to pay the fees at the current published rate.

#### **2\. Payment**

**‍**When you sign up for a subscription, you must choose a payment method. You are responsible for providing a valid payment card and notifying us of any changes to this information. You expressly authorize the subscription fees to be charged to your selected payment method. Payments will be billed in the currency of your region based on your Wave Account (USD or CAD). Where applicable, applicable taxes will be automatically applied. 

Your payment method will be charged automatically by Wave, Apple, or Google (depending on your subscription method) on your Renewal Date (at the start of the monthly or annual billing period). 

If there is an issue with your payment method, you will be allowed to access the Service for a certain length of time as set out below (“Grace Period”) while Wave, Apple, or Google (depending on your subscription method) attempts to charge your payment method. Your subscription will be considered active until the Grace Period expires.

* If you subscribed through Wave, the Grace Period is fifteen (15) calendar days. Wave may retry payment up to five (5) times during the Grace Period. 
* If you subscribed through Apple, the Grace Period is sixteen (16) days.
* If you subscribed through Google, the Grace Period is fourteen (14) days.

  
If your payment information is not accurate, current, and complete, or if we are unable to process your subscription fees and you do not pay the fees due for your use of the Subscription Service before the end of the Grace Period, we will immediately suspend or terminate your access to the Service without notice.

#### In simple Terms

Your chosen payment method will be automatically charged at the start of your billing period. If the payment method we have no longer works, we’ll give you a chance to update your payment details before we stop providing the Service.

#### **3\. Cancellation**

If you subscribed directly through Wave:

* You can manage your subscription or cancel it through your Wave Account at least one (1) day before the Renewal Date by following these steps.

  
If you subscribed through Apple or Google:

* You can manage your subscription or cancel it through your [Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039) or [Google](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7018481) account at least one (1) day before the Renewal Date. 

  
If you choose to cancel your subscription, it will remain active until the end of your current billing period. The cancellation of your subscription will go into effect after the last day of your current billing period, and you will have the same level of access to the Subscription Service through the remainder of the billing period. When your subscription ends, you will immediately lose access to any functionality or features of the Subscription Service that require an active subscription. 

* For Wave’s receipt scan feature subscribers, you will not lose access to previously created digital expense records. 
* For Wave’s Pro Plan subscribers, you will not lose access to your data, however, your subscription will be downgraded to the standard features as listed on the [Pricing](https://www.waveapps.com/pricing) page.  

  
Once you have canceled your subscription and received confirmation of such cancellation, no other changes can be made to your Account, unless you choose to purchase a new subscription. **Please note that ceasing your use of the Subscription Service or uninstalling the App will not cancel your subscription.** 

If you ask us to delete or close your Account and you subscribed directly through Wave, we will automatically cancel your subscription at the end of the billing period. If you subscribed through Apple or Google, you will be responsible for canceling your subscription yourself through your [Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039) or [Google](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7018481) account.

#### In simple Terms

Like we said, we want you to feel comfortable. You always have the right to cancel your subscription by taking the steps set out above. If you choose to cancel your subscription, it will take effect at the end of the billing period.

#### **4\. Refunds**

If you subscribed directly through Wave:

* Wave does not provide refunds or credits for cancellations or partially used subscriptions. This applies to both monthly and annual subscriptions. All subscription purchases are final and non-refundable, except at Wave’s sole discretion. 

  
If you subscribed through Apple or Google:

* All subscription purchases are final and non-refundable, except at Apple or Google’s sole discretion and in accordance with the rules governing each subscription. Please note that Wave cannot assist with providing refunds for subscriptions purchased through Apple or Google and you must reach out to [Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT204084) or [Google](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2479637?sjid=9113397108395015294-NA#policy) directly.

* To post, e-mail, upload, scan, or otherwise provide to Wave, either directly or indirectly, private, personally-identifiable or otherwise confidential information to Wave’s Subscription Services or any Service, including, without limitation, your or any other person's or entity’s non-truncated credit card information, social security, social insurance, or alternate government-issued identity numbers, non-public phone numbers, or non-public email addresses.

You will use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized use of the Subscription Service and to terminate any unauthorized use. You are responsible for all use of your Account and your User ID and other access information (ex. passwords, if any). You will promptly notify Wave of any unauthorized use of, or access to, any Service(s) of which you become aware. Wave may suspend, disable, or change your Account or User ID (or password) at any time if Wave believes that any of your access information has been compromised, that you or someone using your Account is a threat to the integrity or security of any Service(s), or if Wave has another reasonable basis for doing so.

#### In simple Terms

As I’m sure you can imagine, there are all sorts of risks related to financial systems and running computer services in general. This whole section is a big long list of “don’ts”. Please make sure you understand and avoid them all. You also need to make sure you’re not enabling other people to do these things.

Keep all account information, user IDs and other access information confidential and notify Wave of any authorized use of or access to the Wave Services of which you become aware.

### **G. Termination**

Wave will automatically renew your subscription at the then-current rates, unless the Subscription Service is canceled or terminated in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. For more information, refer to Section D.3 (Cancellation).

#### In simple Terms

You will continue to be billed for the Subscription Service until your subscription is canceled or terminated.

#### ‍**1\. Your Right to Terminate**

If you subscribed directly through Wave:

* You may terminate the Subscription Service at any time by canceling your subscription through your Wave Account as set out in Section D.3 (Cancellation) of this Agreement.  
    ‍

If you subscribed through Apple or Google:

* You may terminate the Subscription Service at any time by canceling your subscription through your [Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039) or [Google](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7018481) Account as set out in Section D.3 (Cancellation) of this Agreement.  
    ‍

Your termination of the Subscription Service will automatically result in the termination of this Agreement at the end of the billing period. For more information, refer to Section D.3 (Cancellation).

#### In simple Terms

You always have the right to cancel your subscription and close your Account, subject to the terms and conditions of this agreement. If you choose to cancel your subscription, it will take effect at the end of the billing period.

#### **2\. Our Right to Terminate**

Without limiting the generality of Section J (Termination of Service) of the Wave TOU, upon notice to you, we may terminate this Agreement and terminate the Subscription Service for any reason with or without cause. We may choose to terminate the Subscription Service without terminating your other Wave Services. We may also suspend your access to the Subscription Service if you:

* Have violated the terms of Wave’s policies or this Agreement; or
* Have provided any false, incomplete, inaccurate, or misleading information or have otherwise engaged in fraudulent or illegal conduct.  
    ‍

If your Account is suspended, Wave reserves the right to cancel your subscription without a refund.

#### In simple Terms

Situations may come up where we need the right to close your Account or suspend your right to access your Account. Some examples of why we might do this are in this section.

#### **3\. Termination**

If your Account is terminated for any reason, you agree:

* To continue to be bound by the applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the Arbitration Provision;
* To immediately stop using the Subscription Service;
* That the license provided under this Agreement will end;
* That we reserve the right (but have no obligation other than as described in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.waveapps.com/legal/privacy-policy)) to delete all of your information and Account data stored on our servers; and
* That Wave will not be liable to you or any third party for termination of access to the Service, deletion of your information or Account data, or export of your information or Account data.

#### In simple Terms

If your Account is terminated for any reason, you agree that: (i) certain terms and conditions of this Agreement will continue to apply; (ii) to immediately stop using the Subscription Service; (iii) the license we provide to you will come to an end; (iv) Wave may delete your information and account data on our servers (subject to our Privacy Policy); and (v) Wave won't have any legal responsibility or obligation to you as a result of your access to the Subscription Service being terminated, or your information or data being deleted or exported.

#### **4\. Effect of Termination, Expiry, or Suspension**

Upon termination, expiry, or suspension of this Agreement for any reason, you will cease using the Subscription Service. We will not be liable to you for compensation, reimbursement, or damages in connection with any termination, expiry, or suspension of the Subscription Service. Any termination, expiry, or suspension of this Agreement does not relieve you of any obligations to pay any fees or costs accrued prior to the termination, expiry, or suspension and any other amounts owed by you to us as provided by this Agreement or the Wave TOU.

#### In simple Terms

We have no obligation or responsibility to compensate or reimburse you for any damages or amounts in connection with a suspended or terminated Subscription Service. You will still be responsible for paying outstanding fees on termination, expiry or suspension of this agreement.

#### **2\. Disclaimers**

The Subscription Service is not intended to be used outside the United States or Canada. Those who access or use the Subscription Service from other jurisdictions do so of their own volition and are entirely responsible for compliance with all applicable federal and local Laws and regulations, including but not limited to export and import regulations.

#### In simple Terms

Wave’s Subscription Service is only meant to be used in the United States and Canada.

THE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. USE OF THE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE IS PROVIDED WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM WAVE OR THROUGH THE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED HEREIN. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, WAVE, ITS PROCESSORS, ITS PROVIDERS, ITS LICENSORS (AND THEIR RESPECTIVE SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, AGENTS, DIRECTORS, AND EMPLOYEES) DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE CONTENT IS ACCURATE, RELIABLE OR CORRECT; THAT THE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS; THAT THE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE WILL BE AVAILABLE AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME OR LOCATION, UNINTERRUPTED OR SECURE; THAT ANY DEFECTS OR ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED; OR THAT THE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE IS FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.

WAVE DOES NOT WARRANT, ENDORSE, GUARANTEE, OR ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY PRODUCT OR SERVICE ADVERTISED OR OFFERED BY A THIRD PARTY THROUGH THE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE OR ANY HYPERLINKED WEBSITE OR SERVICE, OR FEATURED IN ANY BANNER OR OTHER ADVERTISING, AND WAVE WILL NOT BE A PARTY TO OR IN ANY WAY MONITOR ANY TRANSACTION BETWEEN YOU AND THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES.

#### In simple Terms

This Subscription Service is as-is which means that you’re agreeing to use it in its current condition - flaws and all! We can’t make any guarantees that you won’t run into bugs, defects, glitches, or interruptions along the way.

### **I. Limitation of Liability and Indemnity**

THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SET OUT IN SECTION I OF THE WAVE TOU WILL APPLY. IN ADDITION, OUR MAXIMUM LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR YOUR USE OF THE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE WILL BE LIMITED TO THE SUBSCRIPTION FEES YOU PAID FOR THE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE DURING THE SIX (6) MONTHS PRECEDING THE APPLICABLE CLAIM. 

IN NO EVENT WILL WAVE’S THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS HAVE ANY LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED TO THE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE.

#### In simple Terms

You agree that the only parts of this Subscription Service where Wave accepts liability are those places where we explicitly say so in the [Wave TOU - Section I](https://www.waveapps.com/legal/terms-of-use).

### J. Miscellaneous

#### **  
1\. Governing Law**

If you reside in the United States, this Agreement shall in all respects be governed by and interpreted, construed, and enforced in accordance with the Laws of the state in which you accepted this Agreement, except as otherwise provided in the Arbitration Provision. 

Otherwise, unless provided in the Arbitration Provision, this Agreement shall in all respects be governed by and interpreted, construed, and enforced in accordance with the Laws of the Province of Ontario and the federal Laws of Canada applicable therein as applied to agreements entered into and to be performed entirely within Ontario, without regard to its choice of Law or conflicts of Law principles that would require the application of the Law of a different jurisdiction.

#### In simple Terms

If you reside in the United States, when we say ‘Law’ we mean the Laws that apply in the state where this Agreement was accepted. Otherwise, when we say ‘Law’ we mean the Laws that apply in Ontario and Canada.

#### **2\. Entire Agreement**

Except as otherwise provided in the Arbitration Provision, this Agreement, including the Wave TOU, is the entire and exclusive agreement between parties with respect to Wave’s Subscription Service, and it supersedes all previous communications, representations, or agreements, either oral or written, between you and us.

#### In simple Terms

This Agreement (and our Wave TOU) overwrites any other agreement you’ve signed with us.

#### **3\. Assignment**

This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you but may be assigned by Wave without restriction or consent.

#### In simple Terms

You can’t assign this agreement over to anyone else; we can have someone stand in for us.

#### **4\. Amendment of Agreement**

Except as otherwise provided in the Arbitration Provision, we reserve the right to modify or add to this Agreement at any time and to change, delete, discontinue, or impose conditions on any feature or aspect of the Subscription Service with notice that we in our sole discretion deem to be reasonable in the circumstances, including but not limited to notice on our website or any other website maintained or owned by us and identified to you. Any use of the Subscription Service after our publication of any such changes shall constitute your acceptance of the then-current version of this Agreement. You may not modify or amend this Agreement unless we agree to such modification or amendment in a written instrument signed by a duly authorized representative of Wave. For the purposes of this section, a written instrument shall expressly exclude electronic communications such as email and electronic notices including facsimiles.

#### In simple Terms

Wave can change this agreement and we’ll give you reasonable notice. Using the Subscription Service means you agree to the version of the agreement that is current at that time. You can’t make changes to this agreement without getting us to agree to them in writing, which in this case actually means ‘pen to paper’.

#### **5\. Survival**

Any provision that is reasonably necessary to accomplish or enforce the purpose of this Agreement or that expressly or by their nature extends beyond the termination of the Subscription Service, including but not limited to the Arbitration Provision, shall survive and remain in effect in accordance with its terms upon the termination or expiry of this Agreement.

#### In simple Terms

This section extends the effectiveness of certain provisions, for example, the arbitration provision in the Wave TOU, beyond the expiration or termination of this agreement.

#### **6\. Severability**

Except as otherwise provided in the Arbitration Provision, all provisions of this Agreement, notwithstanding the manner in which they have been grouped together or linked, are severable from each other. If any of these terms should be determined to be unenforceable, the remaining terms of this Agreement shall survive and remain in full force and effect and continue to be binding and enforceable.

#### In simple Terms

This document isn’t “all or nothing.” If some parts of it don’t hold up, the rest is still in effect.

#### **7\. Language**

You and we expressly acknowledge and agree that this Agreement and all related agreements, schedules, materials, licenses, and policies be drafted in the English language only. Il est convenu que cette convention et tous les annexes, documents, licences et politiques s'y rattachant soient rédigés en anglais.

#### In simple Terms

We do business in English. But if you ask us how we communicate our love, we speak “championing small businesses.” They’re the heart of our communities.
