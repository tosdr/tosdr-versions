1\. Accessing Our Services
==========================

1.1 Public Services
-------------------

We make some Services available without registering or obtaining a password. We call these “Public Services.” You may make personal, non-commercial use of the Public Services so long as you comply with these Terms. This personal use includes linking to information appearing in the Public Services, provided you do not represent yourself as an employee, agent or representative of RevenueWell. Personal use also includes temporary caching by your browser or a proxy server. If you operate a free, public search engine that has made a public commitment to adhering to the robots.txt protocol, together with our Sitemaps and Crawl-delay directive (collectively, the “Protocol”), you may crawl, index and publish hyperlinks (including so-called “deep links”) to the Public Services, so long as (i) you do so in compliance with the Protocol instructions published in applicable locations on our Services, (ii) you do not directly or indirectly receive remuneration in connection with the provision or display of said hyperlinks and cached pages, and (iii) if your user-agent is disallowed by us in our Protocol instructions or we otherwise notify you in writing, you shall cease all crawling of our Services. We call such a free, public search engine satisfying the requirements of clauses (i) through (iii), a “Public Search Engine,” and the Public Search Engine’s combined performance of clauses (i) through (iii), collectively, “Public Search Services.” We may revoke the foregoing authorizations at any time as indicated in our Protocol instructions. We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you. This means that if you wish to use the Public Services in a way that is not authorized above, you must receive our permission prior to such use.

1.2  Protected Services
-----------------------

Some of our Services are protected by technical measures intended to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity and accessibility of sensitive information our users store and share using our Services. We call these “Protected Services.” One such safeguard is requiring each user to be properly authenticated by various means (which we call, “Credentials”), such as unique identifiers, API keys, passwords, and the like. In order to obtain Credentials, you must provide certain information about yourself. If you sign up for one of our Protected Services you may be asked to agree to a client services agreement and the incorporated [Customer Terms and Conditions](http://www.revenuewell.com/legal/msa) (your “User Agreement”). In such cases, you will be asked to expressly consent to your User Agreement, for example, by checking a box or clicking on a button with terms such as “I agree” or the like. Your Credentials are unique to you. You should immediately notify us if your Credentials have been stolen or compromised. You are responsible for all activities that occur under your Credentials until you have properly notified us that your Credentials have been stolen or compromised. Further, you represent, warrant and covenant that:

* the information you submit in obtaining your Credentials is complete and accurate and identifies you and the name of each of your Principals;
* you will not share your Credentials with anyone else;
* you will not circumvent, or attempt to circumvent, any technical measures that we have put in place to safeguard the Protected Services;
* you will not, without our prior written approval, access or use, or attempt to access or use, any portion of the Protected Services other than with (i) a commercial browser (such as Chrome, Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox), (ii) an application made for mobile or handheld device(s) that is developed and distributed by us, or (iii) our application programming interface (“API”) using Credentials issued to you directly by us, and only us; and
* You will not access or use, or attempt to access or use, a Protected Service without validly-issued active Credentials.

We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to any Protected Service at any time, with or without cause or notice. We shall not be liable to you in any way if we suspend or terminate your access to a Protected Service or our Services.

1.3 Patient Portal Users
------------------------

### 1.3.1 Patient Portal Overview

RevenueWell provides a personal health record service (your “Patient Portal”) as a free service to patients (and their personal representatives), on behalf of the doctors and other healthcare providers within our health record network (“Providers”). This Agreement applies to your use of your Patient Portal. By signing up for, or otherwise obtaining, an account, or by accessing or using your Patient Portal, you are entering into this Agreement and agreeing to be bound by its terms. Please read this Agreement carefully, and do not sign up for an account or use your Patient Portal if you are unwilling or unable to be bound by this Agreement. Your Patient Portal is made available on our [www.patientconnect365.com](https://www.patientconnect365.com/) website, the use of which is governed by these [Terms of Use](https://www.patientconnect365.com/Home/TermsOfUse) and [Privacy Policy](https://www.patientconnect365.com/Home/PrivacyPolicy).

### 1.3.2 Your Patient Portal

Your Patient Portal is an internet-based portal that allows your Provider to make certain health information available to you. In addition to your health information, if you have the authority under applicable law to access the health information of another individual, such as your child, that individual’s Provider may, in his or her discretion and within the constraints of the Service capabilities, grant you access privileges for that individual’s health information through your Patient Portal. Access to your Patient Portal is granted to you by your Provider. Once invited, you will receive an email inviting you to register an account. To register, you will need to satisfy our identity verification and certification procedures and select a user ID and password. If you believe someone has had unauthorized access to your Patient Portal, please contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.patientconnect365.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). Your Provider (or the Provider of an individual with respect to whom you are authorized to access his/her health information) is responsible for granting access privileges to your Patient Portal and for the information made available to you through your Patient Portal. Because your Patient Portal includes information created by your Provider, such information may contain typographical errors, inaccuracies or omissions. In addition, although your Patient Portal displays certain information from your medical records, it does not necessarily display all information in the health records retained by your Provider. If you think that your medical information displayed in your Patient Portal is inaccurate or incomplete, or if you would like to request a complete copy of your medical record, please contact your Provider directly. Because your Patient Portal includes information that is part of your Provider’s health record about you, you cannot delete such information. You may, however, terminate your access to your Patient Portal by contacting Your Provider directly. Your Provider also retains the ability to revoke your access to your Patient Portal.

### 1.3.3 Regulations Concerning Information Included in your Patient Portal

We do not control your Provider’s use or disclosure of your health information. Your Provider should give you a notice of privacy practices that describes how he or she uses and discloses health information about you. Your Provider’s ability to disclose your health information for these and similar purposes is restricted by applicable laws and regulations, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health of 2009 (“HITECH”), and the regulations adopted thereunder. If you wish to restrict the disclosures that your Provider makes of your health information, please contact your Provider directly. We, like your Provider, are also subject to laws and regulations, including HIPAA, which govern the use and disclosure of certain personal and health information. We make your Patient Portal available to you on behalf of your Provider, as a “business associate” (as defined by HIPAA) of your Provider, pursuant to our [Customer Terms and Conditions](http://www.revenuewell.com/legal/msa). Under this agreement, we are prohibited from, among other things, using individually identifiable health information in a manner that your Provider may not. We are also required to, among other things, apply reasonable and appropriate measures to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity and availability of individually identifiable health information we store and process on behalf of your Providers. To see our Customer Terms and Conditions – [click here](http://www.revenuewell.com/legal/msa), and to specifically review our business associate obligations to Providers who agree to our Customer Terms and Conditions.

### 1.3.4 Other RevenueWell Services

Although your Patient Portal is made available on our patientconnect365.com website, this Section 1.3 only applies to your Patient Portal. All other RevenueWell Services made available are covered by our Terms of Use and/or a separate User Agreement.  

1.4 Telehealth, Teledentistry, and Virtual Visit Users
------------------------------------------------------

### 1.4.1 Description

We have developed a proprietary telehealth platform for use by physicians and dentists (“Providers”) for use with their patients for professional services during times when in-person visits are not convenient or possible.  Users may access the Platform via a web-based portal or a mobile app. We do not guarantee that any of the information provided through the Platform is accurate or up-to-date.  We do not own, manage, endorse, advocate for, or operate the any of the Providers who use the Platform. We cannot assure that the persons who claim to be Providers are, in fact, qualified to provide professional services, hold proper licenses or are otherwise in compliance with applicable health care laws and regulations.  We act solely as a platform between patients and remote care Providers such as physicians, dentists, advanced practice nurses, and other third-party service providers who help the Provider  care for their patients.  The Platform is merely a platform and service that helps connect such parties with the patient.

### 1.4.2 Telehealth Disclaimer

You expressly agree that access to and use of OUR Services IS at your sole risk.  OUR Services are provided on an “as is” and an “as available” basis.  WE do not make, and hereby disclaim, any representations or warranties, express, implied, or statutory, regarding (a) the Services; and (b) any products and services offered through YOUR Provider as part of the use of our Services, including (without limitation) implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, non-infringement of third party rights, and any warranties arising by course of dealing or custom of trade.  WE make no representation or warranty that any material, content, products, or services displayed on or offered THROUGH OUR Services are accurate, complete, appropriate, reliable, or timely.  WE also make no representations or warranties that OUR Services will meet your requirements, or that your access to and use of OUR Services will be uninterrupted or error-free, free of viruses, malicious code, or other harmful components, or otherwise will be secure.  YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE SERVICES, OR ANY PART THEREOF, IS BEING PROVIDED BY YOUR PROVIDER SIMPLY AS A TOOL FOR COMMUNICATION AND IT IS NOT BEING PROVIDED BY US TO YOU FOR THE MEDICAL ADVICE THAT A PROVIDER/USER MAY PROVIDE TO PATIENTS, OR A THIRD-PARTY MAY PROVIDE TO PROVIDER/USER AND/OR THEIR PATIENTS, THROUGH USE OF IT. IN THIS RESPECT, WE DISCLAIMS ANY RESPONSIBILITY WHATSOEVER FOR ANY MEDICAL ADVICE THAT MAY BE PROVIDED BY A PROVIDER USING OUR SERVICES FOR THEIR PATIENTS.

You are not eligible to use our Services (including obtaining a Credential or entering into a User Agreement) unless you are at least 18 years old and otherwise have the legal capacity to enter into a binding contract in your jurisdiction. If you are an unemancipated minor over the age of 13, you may only use our Services if: (i) such use has been approved of by your parent or legal guardian, (ii) you use our Services under his or her supervision, and (iii) he or she has agreed to these Terms (and, if applicable, your User Agreement) on your behalf. If you are the parent or guardian of an unemancipated minor, you may use the Services and enter into a User Agreement on behalf of such minor.

Under no circumstances may our Services be used by a child under 13 years old.

1.8 United States Only
----------------------

Access to our Services is administered in the United States (“US”) and is intended for users in the US. You may not use our Services in any jurisdiction where offering, accessing or using our Services would be illegal or unlawful.

2 Nature of the Content Appearing on Our Services
=================================================

2.1 Overview
------------

Our Services may include text, data, graphics, images, video or other content (collectively, “Content”) created by us or third parties, including other users, professionals, partners, advertisers, sponsors, consumers and governmental agencies. The Content is provided for general informational purposes, but should not be relied upon for personal, professional, medical or regulatory decisions. And we do not ensure the completeness, timeliness or accuracy of the Content.

2.2 Ratings; Surveys; Comments; User-Submitted Content
------------------------------------------------------

Our Services allow you to access blogs, message boards, chat services, surveys and other forums where various users can share information, opinions, chats and other Content. We generally do not pre-screen or monitor user-submitted Content, and such Content may simply represent a user’s opinion or Content a user finds interesting. Our Services may also include survey results, ratings or testimonials (“Evaluations”) from patients, clients or other customers (“Patients”) of healthcare professionals (“Professionals”) that may endorse, recommend, critique, analyze, evaluate or otherwise describe the Professionals and the nature or quality of the services received by such patient, client or customer. Such Evaluations are anecdotal first-hand accounts of individual Patients, and are neither professional judgments nor the product of medical science. Such Evaluations do not in any way constitute or imply our endorsement or recommendation of any Professional. Further, Evaluations are subject to errors and biases that are common in anecdotal first-hand accounts, and should not be presumed to be reliable or error-free.

2.3 Directories: Physicians, Consultants, and Other Professionals
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Our Services include listings and directories (“Directories”) to help you find dentists, healthcare professionals, certified consultants or other professionals (collectively, “Professionals”). The Directories are provided for your convenience. The Directories are not comprehensive, but rather generally represent Professionals who use our Services and who have chosen to participate in the Directories. Further, we do not evaluate any Professional and the listing of a Professional does not in any way constitute a recommendation of such Professional. Before obtaining services or treatment from any Professional listed in a Directory, you should take the same care you would under any other circumstance, including by confirming licensure and specialty certifications. The Professionals are solely responsible for the appropriateness and quality of the services they provide. Additionally, the Directories rely on information submitted by Professionals themselves. Unless Professionals provide us with current information, the Directory information may not be timely or accurate. You should confirm such information before obtaining services or treatment from a Professional. As a convenience, the Services may permit you to request an appointment with a Professional. However, Professionals are responsible for maintaining their own schedules, and we cannot ensure that any given Professional will be available, nor that such Professional will not cancel his or her appointment.

2.4 Advertising
---------------

Our Services may include advertisements or promotional messages sponsored by third parties (collectively, “Ads”). The manufacturers, services providers, distributors and resellers of the products and services identified in the Ads are solely responsible for the accuracy of their Ads and the suitability, efficacy, safety and quality of such products or services. An Ad does not in any way constitute or imply our recommendation or endorsement of such product or service.

2.5 Links to Other Sites
------------------------

Our Services may contain hyperlinks (including hyperlinked Ads) to websites operated by third parties, or to materials or information made available by third parties. Such links do not constitute or imply our endorsement of such third parties, or of the content of their sites, or the suitability, efficacy, safety or quality of their products or services, or the information privacy or security practices of their websites.

2.6 No Medical Advice
---------------------

Some Content may include health- or medical-related information. Such Content is provided for general informational purposes only. We do not directly or indirectly practice medicine, render medical advice, or dispense medical services via our Services or otherwise, and nothing contained in our Services should be intended to be a medical diagnosis or treatment. No medical professional/patient relationship is created by your use of our Services or the Content. Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health professional with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition, and never disregard professional medical advice or delay seeking treatment based on any Content or other information included in the Services. If you think you may have a medical emergency, call your healthcare professional or your local emergency number (usually 911) immediately.

2.7 No Legal or Regulatory Advice
---------------------------------

Some Content may include regulatory related information pertaining to you or your business. Such Content is provided for informational purposes only. We are not providing legal or regulatory advice and no attorney/client relationship is created by your use of our Services or the Content. Accordingly, always seek the advice of your attorney or advisors with any questions you may have regarding a law, regulation, or dispute.

4.9 Arbitration
---------------

EXCEPT FOR CLAIMS BY EITHER PARTY UNDER ANY OF SECTIONS OF THE TERMS OF USE LISTED IN PARAGRAPH 2 BELOW, ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM OR CONTROVERSY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE BREACH, TERMINATION, ENFORCEMENT, INTERPRETATION OR VALIDITY THEREOF, INCLUDING THE DETERMINATION OF THE SCOPE OR APPLICABILITY OF THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, SHALL BE SUBJECT TO FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION GOVERNED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT (9 U.S.C. § 1 ET SEQ.). THE ARBITRATION SHALL BE CONDUCTED BEFORE A SINGLE ARBITRATOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE COMMERCIAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEDURES AND THE SUPPLEMENTARY PROCEDURES FOR CONSUMER RELATED DISPUTES OF THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION (THE “AAA”) THEN IN EFFECT, AS MODIFIED BY THIS AGREEMENT, AND WILL BE ADMINISTERED BY THE AAA. JUDGMENT ON THE AWARD MAY BE ENTERED IN ANY COURT HAVING JURISDICTION. THIS CLAUSE SHALL NOT PRECLUDE EITHER PARTY FROM SEEKING TEMPORARY OR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IN CONNECTION WITH AN ARBITRABLE CONTROVERSY, BUT ONLY UPON THE GROUND THAT THE AWARD TO WHICH THAT PARTY MAY BE ENTITLED MAY BE RENDERED INEFFECTUAL WITHOUT SUCH PROVISIONAL RELIEF. THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE SHALL NOT APPLY TO CLAIMS BY ANY PARTY BROUGHT UNDER AND TO ENFORCE ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS OF THESE TERMS OF USE: 1.2, 1.5, 4.2, 4.3 or 4.5.

BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND WE ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIM WITH YOUR CLAIMS OR OUR CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS, OR PRIVATE-ATTORNEY-GENERAL PROCEEDING. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD DECLARATORY OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM.

4.10 Severability

4.11 No Waiver
--------------

Our failure at any time to require performance by you of any provision of these Terms shall in no way affect our right to enforce such provision, nor shall the waiver of any breach by you of any provision herein constitute a waiver of any succeeding breach or the provision itself.

In addition, the words “include,” “includes” and “including” shall be deemed to be followed by the phrase “without limitation.” The word “will” shall be construed to have the same meaning and effect as the word “shall.” The word “or” shall be construed to have the same meaning and effect as “and/or.” The words “herein,” “hereof” and “hereunder,” and words of similar import, shall be construed to refer to these Terms.
