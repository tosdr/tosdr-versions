USER TERMS AND CONDITIONS
=========================

**WELCOME TO VINTED! LET’S GET STARTED WITH THE BASICS**

**Last Updated Date: 29-02-2024**

**1 About you and us**

Who we are. Hey there! We’re Vinted INC. We are registered in Delaware and you can find us at C/o AG Accounting, 735 Geary St. #303, San Francisco, CA 94109. In these Terms, **Vinted**, **we**, **us** and **our** refers to Vinted, UAB. We also refer to **Vinted Affiliates**, which are all companies within our group. 

What we do. We own and manage websites, applications and other platforms (altogether, our **Site**) where we provide the following **Services**:

* **Hosting**, where we act as an intermediary between Buyers and Sellers - we don’t buy or sell Items on the Catalog and aren’t a party to any Transactions, 
* **Buyer Protection**, which is applied for a fee in every Transaction and which ensures their payments are made safely and allows to get a refund if their Item is lost, damaged or significantly not as described with the assistance of our customer support team, and
* other optional services for our Buyers and Sellers which are described below. 

We are responsible for the Services we provide, within the limits of applicable laws and our commitments, and under the conditions set out in these Terms.

About you and our Users. You are one of our **Users** who:

* is a resident of the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii or Puerto Rico,
* is at least 18 years old, 
* has an Account, 
* uses our Services for your personal benefit only and not for any professional purposes , 
* has the capacity and rights to be able to carry out Transactions on the Site, and
* agrees to these Terms and the Catalog Rules. 

Your choice to buy and sell. Users can be:

* a **Seller**, who lists goods and items to sell (each, an **Item**) on an electronic catalog on our Site (the **Catalog**), and/or 
* a **Buyer**, who can view, search and buy an Item or multiple Items as part of a bundle on the Catalog by clicking the buying button, providing their payment details and clicking the “Pay” button (a **Transaction**). 

**2 About these Terms**

About these Terms. These Terms and Conditions (the **Terms**) are a legal agreement between you and us and govern your use of our Site and Services. You agree to these Terms if you click the button indicating your acceptance when you register for a personal Vinted account (an **Account**) or when we notify you of updates to these Terms. 

What **bold** words mean. If you see a capitalised term in bold, that’s a defined term and we’ve provided you with the definition of what it means.

About Catalog Rules. The rules for the Catalog, including what Items you may list (the [**Catalog Rules**](https://www.vinted.com/catalog-rules)), form the essential part of these Terms. It might happen though that something in these Terms contradicts something we say in the Catalog Rules. Then what we say in the Catalog Rules will take precedence over these Terms. 

Other important information. We provide links to important and other helpful information in these Terms, including our [Help Centre](https://www.vinted.com/help) where you’ll find answers to some of the most frequently asked questions from our Users. But if you can’t find what you’re looking for on our Help Centre (which we update regularly), please reach out to us by any method described below. 

**3 Some ways you can contact us**

To report issues. If you find out that another User has done something illegal, violated someone else’s rights or breached these Terms, you can notify us by:

* following the reporting procedure described [here](https://www.vinted.com/help/288),
* filling out [this form](https://www.vinted.com/help/intellectual_property_infringement?access_channel=hc_topics) if you’re specifically reporting illegal Items (such as Items that infringe intellectual property rights other than copyright), or
* submitting, in accordance to Digital Millennium Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 512), written notification to our [Copyright Agent](https://www.vinted.com/help/307-item-authenticity-policy?access_channel=hc_search) designated for Content that may infringe your copyright).

We’ll try to help the affected party and will cooperate with local authorities if required.

To raise a dispute with us. We hope you enjoy using our Services, but if there’s a disagreement between you and us, please let us know by completing our [dispute form](https://www.vinted.com/help/support_tickets/new?ch=help_center&faq_entry_id=615&allow_direct=1) so we can try to resolve the issue as quickly as we can.

For other questions. To send us a question or a notice, you can email us at these [addresses](https://www.vinted.com/help/1253).

**WHAT ALL OUR USERS SHOULD KNOW**

**4 Becoming our User**

How to create an Account. To create your Account and keep it secure, you’ll need to provide us your email and choose a unique username and password. Disposable or masked emails can’t be used to create your Account. 

Verification and security actions. During the Account registration process, and at any time during your use of our Services, we might ask you to:

* help us verify information on your Account (like your phone number, email or payment method), 
* provide additional relevant information,
* remedy any incorrect or incomplete information on your Account, or 
* answer security questions. 

By this we verify that you are the person accessing your account and/or making transactions on the Site. These requests will be proportionate to the security concern we’re trying to resolve. If the information you provide is incomplete or incorrect, or if you don’t cooperate with our requests, we may block your Account as described further below.    

Account restrictions. You’re allowed to have only one Account. But, if we block your original Account because someone unlawfully took it over, you can create a new Account for yourself. 

Promotions. We might notify you about special offers, competitions, games or other kinds of promotions for some or all of our Users (a **Promotion**), depending on eligibility requirements we set. Certain features or functionalities of the Site may be temporarily altered or unavailable during a Promotion. 

Third party websites and content. Certain features on our Site use tools and services that are provided by third parties and are governed by their terms and conditions. We’ll provide you with a link to that third party’s terms and conditions so you can review and accept their agreement before using these features.

How we’ll present information. To provide our Users with the best experience, we may reorganise the Catalog, advertising spaces or other information on the Site. These changes won’t affect Content you provide or our obligations under these Terms. More information about how to retrieve information about advertisements can be found [here](https://www.vinted.com/help/544).

**5 Using information you share with us**

How we use your personal data. We will process your personal data to fulfil our obligations and rights under these Terms and provide you with our Services. Please read our [Privacy Policy](https://www.vinted.com/privacy-policy) for more information about how we collect, store, use and protect your personal data. We put a lot of effort to protect your personal data, but even the strongest security measures can’t always shield against cyberattacks and guarantee that unauthorised third parties won’t find a way to access or affect your personal data. Therefore please consider what personal data or other information you provide us with as it is at your own risk.

How we can use your Content. To the extent permitted by law, you allow us and Vinted Affiliates to have a non-exclusive right to use your Content worldwide, without consideration, during the applicable rights’ duration. This means we can copy, display and adapt Content for operational, commercial, advertising or other internal business purposes and on any type of platform or media including on television, in print media, on the Internet (in banners and articles, on other websites) and on social networks (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.). You can stop our use of your Content for advertising purposes at any time by opting out of this in your Account settings. 

**6 What you must and must not do**

You must. We want to provide our Services in a safe, trusted and secure environment for all Users browsing the Site, but a User’s actions and behaviour can negatively impact this objective. To allow us to achieve a safe and secure environment, you agree to do the following when you use our Site and Services:

* comply with these Terms and applicable laws, 
* provide us with truthful, accurate and up-to-date information about yourself and immediately update your Account if your information changes (like your home address),

* only share information from the Site with third parties, including on social media, if allowed by the Site’s “Share” button, and
* remain responsible for and have all rights to information, photographs or other data you upload on our Site (your **Content**).

You must not. When creating an Account or using the Site or Services, you agree you will not:

* do anything illegal, unethical, contrary to public security or that infringes our or someone else’s rights (like their privacy, confidential information or intellectual property),
* use any kind of external software tools (including but not limited to: bots, scraping programs, crawling programs, spiders) when registering on the Site and/or when using the Site and/or Services (including but not limited to: for the purpose of promoting Items, adding Items to favourite), unless such a use is authorised, offered or in any other way allowed by us,
* use any external software tool that could disrupt the normal operation of the Site or Services or infect or damage another User’s computer,
* adapt, copy, edit, distribute or commercialise any content on the Site without our prior written consent, 
* data mine, screen scrape, crawl, disassemble, decompile or reverse engineer any part of the Site,
* publish Content that praises, promotes, encourages or incites terrorism, racism, revisionism, xenophobia, homophobia, sexism, hate speech, discrimination, human trafficking, organized crime, illegal organizations, self-injury, suicide, torture, cruelty to animals, apology of war crimes, sexual exploitation of children and/or adults, cults or other unlawful Content,
* delete and re-list the same Item multiple times or multiple Items in bulk, 
* collect, hold or disclose information you obtained illegally that relates to other Users, their Content or their actions on the Site, or any information appearing on our Site if it might affect the rights of other Users,

You can check more on our community standards [here](https://www.vinted.com/help/349).

**7 Our rights to handle concerns**

Taking corrective actions. If we find out you’re doing something that’s against the rules described in these Terms or obviously unlawful, we might apply any of the corrective actions listed below:

* send you a warning message that you need to follow these Terms,
* remove or automatically correct your Items in the Catalog,
* demote, hide or remove your Content from the Site,
* hide private messages you sent so your intended recipient can’t see them, 
* restrict your Account by blocking your access to certain features (like sending private messages or limiting visibility of your Items to other Users), or
* notify local authorities about your activity if there’s a threat to someone’s life or safety.

You can check [here](https://www.vinted.com/help/62-why-your-listing-was-hidden-or-deleted?access_channel=hc_topics) to find more information about hiding or removing the listings. 

Blocking your Account. We might block your Account temporarily or definitively if:

* we took a corrective action listed above and you continue to repeatedly breach these Terms,
* you commit a serious breach of these Terms, meaning: 
    * * you provide us with incorrect, false or misleading information on your Account or fail to keep your information up to date, 
        * you don’t cooperate with us when we try to verify information you provide on your Account, 
        * you abuse the Site’s functionalities, or
* one of the scenarios described below: _Suspicions identified by a Vinted Wallet Provider or Payment Processor, or Issues with Transactions, Safety and legal concerns, Minors or Security threats occur._ 

And when we say we will “block” your Account, this means:

* you won’t be able to use the Site except to contact our customer support team (**Customer Support**), 
* your Items will be delisted from the Site and taken off from the Catalog, 
* we won’t refund you for any Seller Services you bought from us and may still be using, 
* you can complete any pending Transactions and Payouts, but if your Account is blocked because of security or fraud concerns raised by a Vinted Wallet Provider, because your Account has been compromised or because it is objectively necessary to protect the legitimate interests and rights of everyone involved in a Transaction the following consequences may occur:
    * * your pending Transactions might be cancelled and all the fees paid by the Buyers would be refunded to the Buyers, and/or
        * your ability to make a Payout might be restricted,
* we may prevent you from creating a new Account on the Site.

You can check [here](https://www.vinted.com/help/92) to find more information on blocking.

Using automated means and acting upon the notification from the authorities. We may sometimes use automated software or algorithms to detect and take the corrective actions listed above or block your Account and we may also act after being duly notified by the competent Authorities.

Corrective actions or blocking will be proportionate. Just to clarify, any of the actions described above will be proportionate to your violation and will take your interests into account.

Statement of reasons. If we take a corrective action listed above or block your Account, we’ll let you know:

* our reasons for doing so, 
* the restriction we’ll apply to your Content or your Account, 
* the facts and legal grounds we relied on to make our decision, 
* information about using automated means to make our decision, and 
* information about what recourse you have (described in more detail in the section below ‘Your option for recourse’). 

However, we won’t provide you with this information if doing so would violate the law or direction of a legal authority, is prohibited by a Vinted Wallet Provider or Payment Processor, disrupt a fraud investigation or enable fraud to continue or be considered a serious breach of these Terms or a Vinted Wallet Provider’s terms and conditions.

Taking corrective action or blocking without a prior notice. We can take corrective actions or block your Account without notifying you reasonably in advance if one of the below scenarios occurs. We’ll only provide you with a statement of reasons at the time we take action:

* _Suspicions identified by  a Vinted Wallet Provider or Payment Processor_: a Vinted Wallet Provider or Payment Processor reports a suspicion to us that you violated the law, breached their terms and conditions or misused the Site when using their payment and/or wallet services (including illegal sales on the Site, money laundering, terrorist financing, scamming, identity theft or use of false documents). 
* _Issues with Transactions_: you start a dispute resolution procedure about a Transaction through a Payment Processor and there are objective and legitimate reasons to believe that, in this context, you violated the law, breached these Terms or misused the Site.
* _Safety and legal concerns_: your Content or use of the Services violates the law, regulations or rules of public security or is likely to have serious consequences for the health, safety or legitimate economic interests of us, other Users, or third parties. This might be:
    * * uploading Content that condones crimes against humanity, incites racial hatred or violence, concerns child pornography or other sexual harassment or seriously threatens other Users,
        * committing identity theft or any other type of fraud, or
        * misusing the Site in a way that puts the safety of other Users or security of the Site at risk (such as logging in from suspicious IP addresses, scamming or spamming other Users). We’ll conduct a fraud investigation and seriously examine any claims you made.
* _Minors_: if you are using the Account and you are less than 18 years old.
* _The law prohibits us_: notifying you in advance would violate a law, regulation or direction of a legal enforcement authority, or could put us or Vinted Affiliates at risk.
* _Security threats_: there's a threat to the security or smooth operation of our IT system.  
* _Repeated or serious breaches_: you commit a serious or repeated breach of these Terms.

Your options for recourse. You can challenge our decision to take any corrective action by:

* submitting an appeal through our system. To do this, click the link in the statement of reasons we sent you (if we blocked your Account or took a corrective action  listed above ) or other communication we sent you (if you had notified us about a non-compliant Content or Account). We’ll review your appeal as soon as we can under the supervision of qualified staff, or

* bringing an action before national courts under applicable laws.

If your Content was removed due to a copyright removal request and you believe it's because of a mistake or misidentification, you can submit to our designated [Copyright Agent](https://www.vinted.com/help/307-item-authenticity-policy?access_channel=hc_search) a counter notification. 

**8 How to set up a Vinted Wallet**

About Vinted Wallets. You can create a **Vinted Wallet**, which is an electronic wallet available on the Site. You can use your Vinted Wallet to:

* receive and store funds for an Item you sell, 
* buy an Item from another User using funds in the Vinted Wallet, 
* transfer funds from your Vinted Wallet to your personal bank account (a **Payout**), or 
* purchase optional Services available to Buyers and Sellers.  

Who needs one? Any User can set up a Vinted Wallet following the steps below. If you’re a Seller, you’ll need to create a Vinted Wallet within 5 calendar days of making your first sale.

How they’re provided. Vinted Wallets is a payment service which is provided by our regulated third-party payment service provider (a **Vinted Wallet Provider**) ADYEN N.V., a licensed bank in the Netherlands which is regulated by the Central Bank of the Netherlands (De Nederlandsche Bank)

How to open a Vinted Wallet. To request to open a Vinted Wallet, simply go to your Account and:

* go to “Profile”,  select “Balance” and then press “Activate Balance”, 
* if you don’t open a wallet earlier, you will be asked to do so within 5 calendar days of making your first sale, otherwise you will not be able to ship the sold item and the Transaction will be cancelled
* provide us with your full name and address. Depending on the Vinted Wallet Provider, you may be also required to provide the following: either your date of birth or personal code, address, nationality, phone number and/or SSN number (see [here](https://www.vinted.com/help/418/266-activate-your-vinted-balance?access_channel=hc_topics) for more information), and
* agree to the Vinted Wallet Provider’s terms and conditions and acknowledge their privacy policy (we’ll provide you with a link to these in the wallet opening form).

KYC Checks. Vinted Wallet Providers require you to complete the “Know Your Customer” procedure (**KYC Checks**). KYC is a procedure based on anti-money laundering and terrorist financing regulations that require Vinted Wallet Providers to verify your identity and suitability for the use of a Vinted Wallet (see [here](https://www.vinted.com/help/15/111-why-you-may-be-asked-for-your-id?access_channel=hc_topics) for more information). The initial check is done during the opening of  a Vinted Wallet as described above in the “How to open a Vinted Wallet” section. Vinted Wallet Providers may require you to complete additional KYC Checks and depending on their internal procedures and applicable laws you may need to provide a copy of your passport, ID card (if applicable), driver’s licence, bank statement and/or proof of residency in the following cases:

* you reached a threshold of the total value of Transactions you made or total amount of Payouts you made using your Vinted Wallet - these thresholds depend on which Vinted Wallet Provider is providing services to you (see [here](https://www.vinted.com/help/15/111-why-you-may-be-asked-for-your-id?access_channel=hc_topics) for more information),
* at any point after you opened a Vinted Wallet if Vinted Wallet Provider suspects that your Vinted Wallet is connected to fraudulent, suspicious or illegal activity.

If you fail a KYC Check. If you fail a KYC Check or don’t complete one during your initial request to open a Vinted Wallet, then you won’t be able to open a Vinted Wallet. If this happens at any point during your use of a Vinted Wallet, your Vinted Wallet will be suspended and you might not be able to make purchases with funds in the Vinted Wallet or make a Payout (you can find more details about Payouts  further below). These limitations to your Wallet can be also applied by the Vinted Wallet Provider in cases where it suspects that you are connected to fraudulent, suspicious or illegal activity. 

How to make a Payout. You can request a Vinted Wallet Provider to make a Payout by going to “Settings” in your Account and adding your bank account number, full name and billing address. You can only make a Payout in your local currency and within your home country. Making a Payout in another currency or outside of your home country is not allowed. 

**9 How to make payments**

How to pay on our Site. We aim to make paying for Items or purchasing our Services as easy as possible. You can make a payment using:

* your Vinted Wallet - if you have funds in the Vinted Wallet, it will be used automatically as the primary payment method and if you don’t have enough funds to complete your purchase, you can pay the rest with a different payment method, 
* your credit card or debit card, or
* another payment method we might introduce on our Site. 

Processing your payment. We use authorised third party payment service providers (**Payment Processors**) to:

* process online payments for the purchase of Items or optional Services on our Site
* process Payouts from your Vinted Wallet, or
* in certain cases provide Vinted Wallet services too (act as Vinted Wallet Provider). 

We also contract with third party providers to store your payment method information. We’ll provide you with help so you can use your Vinted Wallet and our Payment Processors, but we don't handle your payments ourselves.

Holding money securely. If you buy an Item, all money you pay will go into a separate **Escrow** account that’s safely controlled by a Vinted Wallet Provider until the Transaction is completed. Then, the Item price and any shipping costs you have paid besides Prepaid Shipping fees will be released to the Seller’s Vinted Wallet.

Safety & security. Please ensure that your payment details are accurate so that payments made on our Site are safe and secure. Otherwise, your payment might be cancelled or you may be required to prove a payment method is yours or that you authorised a payment, if the automated software systems think it was stolen.

**10 Sending messages & leaving reviews**

User responsibility. You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Users and any other parties with whom you interact. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to intercede in disputes between Users. You agree that we will not be responsible for any liability incurred as the result of such interactions.

Private messages. You can send a private message to other Users to exchange information about an Item. You must not send a private message to another User for any other reason, especially:

* advertisements, 
* malware,
* unsolicited or mass messages that are sent to 5 or more Users, and
* messages that are or could be considered illegal, obscene, harmful, unethical, threatening to public security, inappropriate or in any way incompatible with the best interests of Vinted and our Users.

Leaving a review. After a Transaction is complete, you can choose to write and publish a review about the Transaction and other User on our Site. All reviews you publish must be fair and honest. Please also be aware that we won’t compensate you in any form for leaving a review and we don’t review or verify reviews before they’re published on our Site. 

**11 Ending our relationship**

You can end our relationship. You can end your relationship with Vinted and stop your use of our Services at any time and free of charge by deleting your Account or emailing us at these [addresses](https://www.vinted.com/help/1253). 

Or we can. We can also end these Terms at any time and for any reason by giving you 30 days’ prior written notice.

What happens then. These Terms will apply until any pending Transactions and Payouts are completed.

**READY TO MAKE SOME MONEY?**

**12 Selling an Item on Vinted**

What you can sell. You must have the right to transfer ownership of an Item to a Buyer. The Item you want to sell must also:

* comply with the [Catalog Rules](https://www.vinted.com/catalog-rules), 
* comply with restrictions and requirements of Payment Processor’s prohibited items, if applicable. See [here](https://www.vinted.com/help/1039-payment-service-provider-on-vinted?access_channel=hc_topics) to learn if such requirements are applicable in your country, and
* not be something you originally purchased in bulk or as a dropship product (as in, you don’t physically have the Item) with a low resale value. 

Listing an Item for sale. To list an Item for sale on the Site, you will need to take and upload a photo and write a description (neither can be taken from the internet, more information [here](https://www.vinted.com/help/4/48-what-photos-you-should-upload?access_channel=hc_topics)) of the Item that accurately reflects its quality and appearance (including any defects or alterations). Have a look [here](https://www.vinted.com/help/375-uploading-an-item-step-by-step?access_channel=hc_topics) for examples about what information you might be asked to provide. Once your Item is listed on the Catalog and published on the Site, this means you officially put forward an offer for sale which can be accepted by a Buyer. 

Buyer’s choice. If a Buyer proposes a new price for an Item as a counteroffer, the Item is not considered sold if you accept their counteroffer. A Buyer always has the option not to buy your Item after your acceptance of the counteroffer. Your Item is sold after a Buyer buys it by clicking the buying button and their payment is accepted.

Withdrawing your listing. You can withdraw a listing at any time before a Buyer purchases the Item.

How we rank & recommend info. We use automation tools to understand, rank and recommend relevant information to Users browsing our Site. More information about how we use automation to recommend certain information on the “Vinted feed” is on our [Help Centre](https://www.vinted.com/help/409-recommended-content-on-vinted?access_channel=hc_search). 

**READY TO SHOP?**

**13 Buying an Item** 

How to buy an Item. To purchase an Item from the Catalog, you will need to:

* click the buying  button, 
* select  a payment method and  delivery option, and 
* click the paying button on the checkout page. 

How much you’ll pay. For every Transaction, you will pay the following fees that will be held in Escrow:

* Item price,
* Shipping  fee,  
* Buyer Protection fee (click [here](https://www.vinted.com/help/342-buyer-protection-fee-on-vinted?access_channel=hc_search) to see how we calculate it), and, if applicable
* fees for optional services. 

What happens next? We’ll receive updates from the carrier and will notify you when the Item should have been delivered (or if the Item appears to be lost). Read more on the process in the chapter below.

If you buy an Item outside of our Site. If you buy an Item offline or outside of our Site, we are not responsible for that transaction. That purchase is made at your own risk and will not be covered by any protections we offer for Transactions made on our Site. 

**14 Buyer Protection**

Purpose of Buyer Protection. Buyer Protection provides you with a refund policy if an Item is lost, damaged or significantly not as described. Customer Support will assist you during this process and follow our [Refund Policy](https://www.vinted.com/help/465?access_channel=hc_topics). Your payment will be held in Escrow until the Transaction is marked as completed. As a heads up, Buyer Protection is not an insurance or a legal protection service and is in addition to all other legal rights or guarantees you have. Buyer Protection is mandatorily applied for a fee and for each purchase made using the buying button.

Refund policy. You can claim for a refund for an Item if it’s:

* confirmed as lost or damaged during shipping, 
* [significantly not as described](https://www.vinted.com/help/1090-significantly-not-as-described-items-at-vinted?access_channel=hc_search), which means there’s a significant difference between the Item you received and its description or photo on the Catalog, such as a different size, colour, or severe damage (like stains, smells or holes), or the Item was missing from a bundle (**SNAD**), or 
* a SNAD counterfeit.

If there are any issues with the Item.  You must report the issue under our [Buyer Protection policy](https://www.vinted.com/help/550?access_channel=hc_topics) to us by clicking the “I have an issue” button in your private message screen within 2 calendar days from our notice that the Item has been delivered or it seems lost (the **Refund Request Period**). This will suspend the Transaction and all money for it will continue to be held in Escrow until the issue is resolved. If you don’t report an issue to us within the Refund Request Period, the Transaction will automatically be marked as completed. 

Handling a SNAD Item (except SNAD counterfeit Items).  We suggest discussing with the Seller first to explain what issue you’re experiencing so you and the Seller can agree on a resolution you’re both happy with. You may:

* resolve the issue between yourselves in the private message without Vinted’s help or 
* if you’re both unable to reach a solution, you can escalate the issue to us.  If the Item is returned, the Buyer is responsible for return shipping unless agreed otherwise with the Seller. 

If you want to read more details about how to return an Item click [here](https://www.vinted.com/help/272). 

If the Users do not resolve the issue within 14 days of you reporting the issue, or if you or the Seller report an issue to us at any point during this process, Customer Support will make the final decision on whether an Item is SNAD.

Handling a SNAD counterfeit Item. If you claim an Item is a SNAD counterfeit within the Refund Request Period, we’ll investigate the issue and reach out to you and the Seller and obtain information from both sides in order to make an objective decision. 

* If the Item’s authenticity is not doubted, then we’ll complete the Transaction and release the money in Escrow to the Seller. 
* If there's not enough information for us to determine whether the Item is a SNAD counterfeit or not, then we’ll deem the case as ambiguous and cancel the Transaction, refund you as described in the table below and require you to return the Item to the Seller and pay for return shipping costs (unless otherwise agreed with the Seller).
* If there’s strong evidence the Item is a SNAD counterfeit, then we’ll notify the Seller. They’ll have 24 hours to provide us with evidence that the Item is authentic. If they can’t or don’t provide this, we’ll cancel the Transaction and you won’t need to return the Item to the Seller in order to get a refund as described in the table below. 

If an issue is escalated to us: We’ll review your case and may ask you and the Seller to provide us with information and evidence to inform the objective decision about whether your case is eligible for a refund under our [Refund Policy](https://www.vinted.com/help/465-vinted-refund-policy?access_channel=hc_search). You and the Seller agree to respect the final decision. If it is decided that the Item must be returned - please follow the Item return timelines communicated to you by Vinted, otherwise the Buyer may not receive a refund. If you resolve the issue between yourselves after having already contacted Vinted, please inform us that the issue has been resolved.

Why you wouldn’t get a refund. You won’t be able to receive a refund if you:

* have already confirmed that everything was ok with the Item when you received it, 
* didn’t report the issue to us within the Refund Request Period, 
* if escalated to Vinted, you 
    * * didn’t provide Customer Support with proof an Item was damaged or SNAD within timelines communicated to you; or
        * report an issue that an Item is SNAD but it’s determined as not a SNAD,
* used, washed or changed the Item in some way before you returned it, or 
* are under investigation because you’re suspected of abusing or misusing the Buyer Protection by claiming the refund.

What type of refund you can get. You can get a refund for certain fees paid as described in the table below:

|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **What you’re returning** | **Type of fee** | **Refund** |
| A single Item (not part of a bundle) | Buyer Protection fee | Full refund |
| Item price | Full refund |
| Prepaid Shipping fee | Full refund |
| Return shipping costs | * If you pay for return shipping, the return shipping costs will be deducted from your refund<br>* If the parcel is lost or damaged, you won’t be charged for return shipping costs |
| The whole bundle of Items\*<br><br>  <br><br>_\*For SNAD counterfeits there is no need to return the counterfeit Item. To get a refund, only return the Items of the bundle that are deemed authentic_ | Buyer Protection fee | Full refund |
| Item price | Full refund |
| Prepaid Shipping fee | Full refund |
| Return shipping costs | * If you pay for return shipping, the return shipping costs will be deducted from your refund<br>* If the parcel is lost or damaged, you won’t be charged for return shipping costs |

**WHAT ELSE DO WE OFFER?** 

**15 Optional services for Sellers**

Seller Services. Sellers can choose to buy other optional services described on the [Help Centre](https://www.vinted.com/help/1252) for additional fees (**Seller Services**). Have a look at the section above called “How to make payments” for information on how you can purchase Seller Services. Each Seller Service is a single-use automated service and is not transferable from one Item to another or between Users. We’ll tell you how much a particular Seller Service costs and how long you can use it before you buy it. We’ll also send you a confirmation of your purchase to your email address. 

**16 Shipping**

What’s Prepaid Shipping. You can purchase a prepaid shipping label on the Site during your Transaction, which is provided by Vinted Go UAB (**Vinted Go**) who transacts with carriers to transport and deliver the Item you purchased (**Prepaid Shipping**). You must use this label provided to you on the Site to send the  Item within 5 business days of purchase, otherwise the Transaction will be cancelled and money refunded to the Buyer. Prepaid Shipping cannot be used for returning an item Vinted does not provide prepaid return shipping labels. 

How much it costs. Prepaid Shipping fees will vary depending on the parcel size, shipping route, carrier and potential discounts. You’ll see how much it will cost before you checkout. 

Tracking the parcel and carriers. You can track the journey status of the Item on the Site, which is based on information provided by the carrier. As far as allowed under the law, we and Vinted Go disclaim any liability if the carrier provides inaccurate, incomplete or outdated tracking information. The delivery time of the Item will depend on the carrier used. You can find out more [here](https://www.vinted.com/help/234) about which carriers are currently available for Prepaid Shipping, but we can add, suspend or remove carriers at any time. The carriers will perform the delivery of the Item. We aren’t a carrier and/or a postal service provider and don’t physically handle, sort, deliver or otherwise deal with an Item purchased on the Site during the process of delivering the Item. 

What you’re responsible for. If you send an Item using Prepaid Shipping, you must comply with Vinted Go **Packaging Rules and Forbidden Item** list, which you can find [here](https://www.vinted.com/help/65). If there’s evidence that you didn’t comply with these, the Terms or Catalog Rules, you may not be eligible to receive a refund or compensation if a parcel is lost or damaged in transit. 

If a parcel is lost or damaged. If there’s a dispute about the loss or damage caused to an Item during transit, the information provided by Vinted Go or the carrier will be considered accurate unless you provide us with evidence to the contrary before the Transaction is completed. If an Item was packaged properly but the parcel is lost or damaged in transit:

* the Buyer will receive a refund under our [Refund Policy](https://www.vinted.com/help/465) (covered by Buyer Protection), and
* the Seller will receive lost or damaged compensation on Vinted, and  the amount may depend on the parcel size and/or which carrier was used (check out the [Help Centre](https://www.vinted.com/help/1018) for more details).

If another method besides Prepaid Shipping is used to ship an Item purchased on the Site, the seller is responsible for lost or damaged parcels and claiming compensation from the carrier directly.
