**It all started with a backpack**

_Since 1960, nature's been in our DNA  
  
_Fjällräven began in one man’s basement and then branched out all over the world. But our original goal hasn’t changed: to inspire and enable more people to walk with nature. Follow our journey from backpacks and tents to sustainable development and events.

Sustainability
==============

* * *

THE LONGTERM PERSPECTIVE
------------------------

Everything we do has an impact on the environment around us and the people and animals that inhabit it. As an outdoor company, we’re acutely aware of this impact and we do our utmost to keep our environmental footprint as small as possible. In parallel the products we develop are built to last for decades of use, to then be passed on to the next generation or be sold on the second hand market. That way, fewer products will be produced, less energy will be consumed and less products will end up as waste. But we can always do better. Sustainability is a special kind of trekking. There are many checkpoints, but no finish line.
