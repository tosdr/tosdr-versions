----------------------------------

_Since 1960, nature's been in our DNA  
  
_Fjällräven began in one man’s basement and then branched out all over the world. But our original goal hasn’t changed: to inspire and enable more people to walk with nature. Follow our journey from backpacks and tents to sustainable development and events.

* **Flash Cookies**. Certain features of our Site may use local stored objects (or Flash cookies) to collect and store information about your preferences and navigation to, from, and on our Site. Flash cookies are not managed by the same browser settings as are used for browser cookies.
* **Web Beacons**. Pages of our Site may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs) that permit us, for example, to count users who have visited those pages or for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity).

SECTION 4 - DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION

* to third-party marketing partners for commercial purposes, unless you have opted out;

* with your consent.

We also reserve the right to transfer your information to a buyer or other transferee in the event of or in anticipation of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, sale, or other transfer of some or all of our assets in which the information held by Fjällräven or our affiliates is among the assets transferred.

We may disclose aggregated information about our users, and information that does not identify any individual user, without restriction.

SECTION 5 - THIRD-PARTY SERVICES
================================

We use various third-party service providers to assist us in maintaining and providing our Site, Offerings, stores, and services. For example, our store is hosted on Episerver, and they provide us with the online e-commerce platform that allows us to sell our products and services to you. In most cases, the third-party providers we use will only collect, use, and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.

In particular, please note that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located in a different jurisdiction than either you or us. If you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your personal information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located.

As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway located in the United States, then your personal information used in completing that transaction may be subject to disclosure under United States legislation, including the USA PATRIOT Act.

SECTION 6 - THIRD-PARTY LINKS
=============================

When you click on certain links on our Site or Offerings, they may direct you away from us. Once you leave our Site or are redirected to a third-party website or application, your use of the third-party website or application will be governed by the privacy notice or terms of service of the third-party website or application.  If you have any questions about the privacy practices of the third-party website or applications, you should contact the responsible provider directly.

SECTION 7 - SECURITY
====================

We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure.   However, the safety and security of your personal information also depends on you.  Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Site and/or Offerings, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. 

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your information, we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted from the Site and/or Offerings. Any transmission of information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Site and/or Offerings.

We use third parties to improve our ability to identify visitors to our Site or Offerings.

We, and third parties, use this data to obtain more information about our visitors and reach out to them through other channels, such as email and/or direct mail. You have the right to opt-out of this activity. To opt out, please follow the instructions in Section 11.
