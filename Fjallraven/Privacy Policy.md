_Since 1960, nature's been in our DNA  
  
_Fjällräven began in one man’s basement and then branched out all over the world. But our original goal hasn’t changed: to inspire and enable more people to walk with nature. Follow our journey from backpacks and tents to sustainable development and events.

For more information about our use of cookies as well as our use of third-party analytics and ad services, see below.

The technologies we use for automatic data collection may include:

* **Cookies** (or browser cookies). A cookie is a small file placed on the hard drive of your computer. You may refuse to accept browser cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser. However, if you select this setting, you may be unable to access certain parts of our Site. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you direct your browser to our Site.
* **Flash Cookies**. Certain features of our Site may use local stored objects (or Flash cookies) to collect and store information about your preferences and navigation to, from, and on our Site. Flash cookies are not managed by the same browser settings as are used for browser cookies.
* **Web Beacons**. Pages of our Site may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs) that permit us, for example, to count users who have visited those pages or for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity).

We may use that combined information to enhance and personalize your experience with us, to communicate with you about products, services, and events that may be of interest to you, for promotional purposes, and for other purposes described in this Privacy Notice.

SECTION 4 - DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION
==========================================

We may disclose personal information about you:

* to third-party marketing partners for commercial purposes, unless you have opted out;
* to comply with any court order, law, or legal process, including to respond to any government or regulatory request;
* to enforce or apply our Terms & Conditions and other agreements;
* if we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of Fjällräven, users of our Site and/or stores, or others; or
* with your consent.

We also reserve the right to transfer your information to a buyer or other transferee in the event of or in anticipation of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, sale, or other transfer of some or all of our assets in which the information held by Fjällräven or our affiliates is among the assets transferred.

We may disclose aggregated information about our users, and information that does not identify any individual user, without restriction.

SECTION 5 - THIRD-PARTY SERVICES
================================

We use various third-party service providers to assist us in maintaining and providing our Site, Offerings, stores, and services. For example, our store is hosted on Episerver, and they provide us with the online e-commerce platform that allows us to sell our products and services to you. In most cases, the third-party providers we use will only collect, use, and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.

In particular, please note that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located in a different jurisdiction than either you or us. If you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the services of a third-party service provider, then your personal information may become subject to the laws of the jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located.

As an example, if you are located in Canada and your transaction is processed by a payment gateway located in the United States, then your personal information used in completing that transaction may be subject to disclosure under United States legislation, including the USA PATRIOT Act.

SECTION 6 - THIRD-PARTY LINKS
=============================

When you click on certain links on our Site or Offerings, they may direct you away from us. Once you leave our Site or are redirected to a third-party website or application, your use of the third-party website or application will be governed by the privacy notice or terms of service of the third-party website or application.  If you have any questions about the privacy practices of the third-party website or applications, you should contact the responsible provider directly.

SECTION 7 - SECURITY
====================

We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure.   However, the safety and security of your personal information also depends on you.  Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Site and/or Offerings, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. 

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your information, we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted from the Site and/or Offerings. Any transmission of information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Site and/or Offerings.

==============================================================

We use third parties to improve our ability to identify visitors to our Site or Offerings. As part of this service, we may make available identifiers to these third parties including our visitors’ IP addresses, cookies, and hashed versions of email addresses captured from your visit. We, and third parties, use this data to obtain more information about our visitors and reach out to them through other channels, such as email and/or direct mail. You have the right to opt-out of this activity. To opt out, please follow the instructions in Section 11.

SECTION 9 - CHILDREN’S INFORMATION

The Site and Offerings are **not** directed at or intended for children under 13 years of age, and Fjällräven does not knowingly collect or solicit information from, children under the age of 13.

SECTION 10 - HOW WE RESPOND TO DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS
===================================================

Your web browser may let you choose your preference as to whether you want to allow the collection of information about your online activities over time and across different website or online services. At this time, the Site does not respond to the preferences you may have set in your web browser regarding such collection of your information, and the Site may continue to collect information in the manner described in this Privacy Notice.
