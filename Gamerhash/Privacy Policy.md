In case the User provides separate consent, the data may also be processed for marketing purposes, sending commercial offers, and organizing and resolving contests.
4. The legal basis for processing personal data is as follows:

1. The legal basis for processing personal data is the user's consent, specifically for marketing activities, sending commercial offers, organizing and resolving contests, and using Cookies and other analytical tools (Article 6(1)(a) of the General Data Protection Regulation - RODO).
2.

6. Personal data processed for the purpose of executing contracts and participating in contests will be processed for the duration of their validity and then for the period necessary to defend against potential claims by the Portal User.
