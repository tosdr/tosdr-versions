**FOREWORDS  
‍**  
We believe that integrity today is one of the most critical issues of modern times. The status quo for using, storing, and handling personal data needs to change to make the digital presence sustainable. The status quo for using, storing, and handling personal data needs to change to make the digital presence sustainable. Social media companies can put us in the loop of endless scrolling, and we consider them holding the biggest responsibility for this.

We are not, in any way, perfect, but we try to do what we can. If you have any feedback on how we can improve integrity on this site, please get in touch with us.

‍**  
If you are habitually located in the European Union, you have the right to access, rectify, download or erase your information, as well as the right to restrict and object to certain processing of your information. While some of these rights apply generally, certain rights apply only in certain limited circumstances.

We describe these rights below:  
‍  
**Access and portability:** to access and know what information is stored in our servers, you can send us your request through our contact information.  
‍  
**Rectify, Restrict, Limit, Delete:** You can also rectify, restrict, limit or delete much of your

**Object:** When we process your information based on our legitimate interests as explained above, or in the public interest, you may object to this processing in certain circumstances. In such cases, we will stop processing your information unless we have compelling legitimate reasons to continue processing it or where it is necessary for legal reasons.  
‍  
**Revoke consent:** Where you have previously given your consent, such as to allow us to process and store your personal information, you have the right to revoke your consent to the processing and storage of your information at any time. For example, you may withdraw your consent by updating your settings. In certain cases, we may continue to process your information after you have withdrawn your consent if we have a legal basis for doing so or if your withdrawal of consent was limited to certain processing activities.  
‍  
**Complaint:** If you wish to file a complaint about our use of your information (and without prejudice to any other rights you may have), you have the right to do so with your local supervisory authority.

**10\. CALIFORNIA ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT COMPLIANCE (CalOPPA)  
‍**  
CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared.  
‍  
Because we value your privacy, we have taken the necessary precautions to be in compliance with the California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA).  
‍  
\* According to the California Online Privacy act, you have the following rights:

\* Know what personal data is being collected.  
‍  
\* Know whether your personal data is sold or disclosed and to whom.  
  
\* Access to your personal data.  
  
\* Request to delete any personal information about you.  
  
\* Not be discriminated against for exercising their privacy rights.

  
**11\. CHILDREN’S ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION  
‍**  
We are in compliance with the requirements of the California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA – U.S regulation) and the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation - European regulation) regarding the protection of the personal data of minors. We do not collect any information from anyone under 13 years of age. Our website and services are all directed to people who are at least 13 years old or older. If you become aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us. If we become aware that a child has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete that information, terminate that person's account, and restrict access to that person.

‍  
**12\. EDITING AND DELETING INFORMATION  
‍**  
If you believe that any information, we are holding on you is incorrect or incomplete, please write to or email us as soon as possible. We will promptly correct any information found to be incorrect. You can change, modify, rectify and delete your Information at any time, please contact us through the contact information. To opt-out of AV Art Sweden AB email, follow the instructions included in the email. Your request should be processed within 48 hours.

If you disclose your information to others, whether other users or suppliers on AV Art Sweden AB, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. AV Art Sweden AB does not control the privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable. AV Art Sweden AB is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of other websites on the Internet, even those linked to or from the AV Art Sweden AB site.
