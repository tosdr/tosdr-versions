##### 7\. RETENTION

_For data which is hosted in Satchel One:_ As noted above, Satchel is not a Data Controller for personal data hosted in Satchel One. Therefore as a Data Processor, we delete this data on the instruction of your school.

Satchel will, pursuant to the school instructions, process and store personal data for students, parents, teachers and school staff members for the duration of the schools license with Satchel. If you leave the school during an active license with your school we will delete/anonymise your personal data within 28 days of your account being deleted by your school.

If you are a parent of children at two different schools which use Satchel, if one school requests that Satchel delete its data your details will still be held by Satchel for the second school.

_For data which is listed in section 3 above:_

For non-Satchel users (such as prospects and business contacts) we will process and store personal data while we are in contact with you with relevant information on our services. If we have not contacted you for a period of 2 years your data will then be removed from our system automatically.

If you have opted out to your data being processed we will delete your data within 28 days of your opt out being received. Sometimes business and legal requirements oblige us to retain certain information, for specific purposes, for an extended period of time. Reasons we might retain some information for longer periods of time include security, fraud prevention, financial record-keeping, complying with legal or regulatory requirements.

##### 8\. YOUR RIGHTS

Where required by applicable law or regulation, you have the right to **ask us for a copy** of your personal information; to **correct**, **delete** or **restrict** (stop any active) processing of your personal information; and to obtain the personal **information you provide to us for a contract or with your consent in a structured, machine readable format**, and to ask us to **share (port) this information to another controller**.

In addition, you can **object to the processing** of your personal information in some circumstances (in particular, where we don’t have to process the information to meet a contractual or other legal requirement, or where we are using the information for direct marketing). These **rights may be limited**, for example if fulfilling your request would reveal personal information about another person, or if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law to keep or have compelling legitimate interests in keeping. We will inform you of relevant exemptions we rely upon when responding to any request you make.

To exercise any of these rights - or get a copy of our legitimate interest balancing tests - you can get in touch with us using the details set out below. If you have unresolved concerns, you have the **right to complain** to an information protection authority where you live, work or where you believe a breach may have occurred.

For the provision of information marked as mandatory when you register to use Satchel One, if such information is not provided, then you will not be able to use the service. All other provision of your information is optional. If you do not provide such information, our provision of certain services to you may be detracted from.
