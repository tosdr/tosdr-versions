11.1 The Customer shall pay the Charges (together with Value Added Tax thereon at the prevailing rate) to Satchel within the agreed timeframe of the receipt of a valid invoice.

11.2 Without prejudice to any right of termination, in the event that any payment due under this Agreement is not made on the due date (in the absence of genuine error) Satchel shall (at its discretion) be entitled to charge interest (both before and after any judgement) on a day to day basis upon the overdue amount at 3% (three per cent) above the base rate from time to time of Barclays Bank Plc compounded quarterly. Satchel reserves the right to claim interest under section 8(2) of the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998.

11.3 Where any payment is overdue (in the absence of genuine error) Satchel reserves the right to terminate the Services.

11.4 Satchel reserves the right to increase the cost of the Satchel Annual Subscription and will make every effort to advise customers, in writing, at least 50 days prior to the next full charging period to which any increase relates. However, where the Contract commences within this 50 day notice period, Satchel reserves the right to increase the Satchel Annual Subscription charge and the Contract will be agreed by both Parties as such written notification.

11.5 The Parties acknowledge that the Charges have been calculated taking into account the recoverability or otherwise of the related input VAT. The Parties agree that if a ruling or appellate body decision or change in HMRC practice results in a VAT liability for all or part of the Services provided herein that differs from these assumptions, to the extent that Satchel’s VAT recovery on costs attributable to the provision of the Services is reduced or improved as a result of the ruling, decision or change in HMRC practise, the charges (exclusive of any VAT) will be increased or reduced (as applicable) with effect from the date that the ruling, decision or change in HMRC practise has effect.

11.6 Where a change in VAT liability is to be applied retrospectively Satchel shall if appropriate submit a claim to HMRC for a refund of VAT charged in respect of the relevant Services already supplied, less additional VAT due to HMRC as a result of the decrease in Satchel’s input VAT recovery. The amount of VAT refunded to the Customer shall be limited to the amount Satchel receives from HMRC (after taking account of any sums potentially payable to HMRC on account of claims to recover VAT input tax) and the Customer shall indemnify and hold harmless Satchel for the costs and expenses incurred in relation thereto less any reasonable costs and expenses incurred in or as a consequence of making such claim.

11.7 Notwithstanding any other right under the Agreement to alter the Charges, Satchel reserves the right to increase the Charges in the event that the Customer’s use of the Services (including but not limited to any significant change which the Customer advises to Satchel it expects to make in the average monthly volume of transmissions of data by use of the Services under Clause 7.4.3) results in a material increase in the level of storage and/or other hosting costs from those reasonably anticipated. Satchel shall give the Customer fair and reasonable notice of seeking to invoke such a ‘fair usage policy’ in order to provide an opportunity to the Customer to return usage to reasonable levels before any increase in Charges shall take effect.

11.8 In-App Purchases

Satchel access may be suspended for overdue payments and Satchel reserves the right to offer or refuse subscriptions for any reason at its sole discretion.

11.9 Payment Processors

All financial transactions made in connection with the Service will be processed by a third party in accordance with their respective terms of use, privacy policy, and/or any applicable payment terms and conditions. In no event will Satchel be responsible for the actions or inactions of any third party payment processor, including, but not limited to, system downtime or payment service outages. To pay any fee, you must designate and provide information about your preferred payment method (such as credit card, online payment service, a third party, like iTunes or Google Play, or any other payment method made available by Satchel)(Payment Method). If the subscription is through the Google Play or iTunes store then any amendments or cancellations are required to be made through the corresponding store account.

If you provide your payment information, you authorise Satchel and certain third party service providers, payment card networks and payment processors to receive, store and encrypt your payment information.
