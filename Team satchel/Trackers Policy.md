Cookie policy
=============

This Cookie Notice was last updated on 10/06/2020

### Cookie Policy

This cookie notice applies to all Satchel websites and mobile applications ("Satchel Platforms"). You may access and change your cookie preferences at any time by clicking below.

Cookie Settings

##### What are cookies?

Satchel (also referred to as "Satchel", "we" or "us") uses cookies on the Satchel Platforms. A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are created when your browser loads a particular website. The website sends information to the browser which then creates a text file. Every time the user goes back to the same website, the browser retrieves and sends this file to the website's server. Find out more about the use of cookies on [www.allaboutcookies.org](https://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

We also use other forms of technology (such as web beacons and, in apps, software development kits (usually referred to as SDKs)) which serve a similar purpose to cookies and which allow us to monitor and improve our Platforms and email communications. When we talk about cookies in this Cookie Notice, this term includes these similar technologies. If you would like more information about our privacy practices, please consult our [Privacy Notice](https://www.teamsatchel.com/legals/privacy_notice.html).

##### What cookies do we use and what information do they collect?

* **Required cookies**: these cookies are required to enable core functionality. Without these cookies, services you have asked for, like adding items to your shopping basket, cannot be provided. If you disable these cookies certain parts of the Satchel Platforms will not function for you, for example, adding items to your basket, proceeding to checkout.
    
* **Analytics cookies**: these cookies help us improve or optimise the experience we provide. They allow us to measure how visitors interact with Satchel Platforms and we use this information to improve the user experience and performance of Satchel Platforms.
    
    These cookies are used to collect technical information such as the last visited Satchel Platform, the number of pages visited, whether or not email communications are opened, which parts of our website or email communication are clicked on and the length of time between clicks.
    
* **Functional cookies**: We may use cookies that are not essential but enable various helpful features on our websites.
    
    For example, these cookies collect information about your interaction with services provided on the Satchel Platforms, and may be used on our Satchel Platforms to remember your preferences (such as your language preference), your interests and the presentation of the website (such as the font size). We will ask for your consent to use these cookies when you request the relevant service.
    
* **Advertising cookies**: we use these cookies to collect information about your browsing habits in order to make advertising more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advert as well as help measure the effectiveness of an advertising campaign. We may share this information with other parties who help manage online advertising – please see the "Third Party" section below for more details.
    

##### Third parties

Your use of Satchel Platforms may result in some cookies being stored that are not controlled by us. This may occur when the part of the Satchel Platform you are visiting makes use of a third party analytics or marketing automation/management tool or includes content displayed from a third party website, for example, YouTube or Facebook. You should review the privacy and cookie policies of these services to find out how these third parties use cookies and whether your cookie data will be transferred to a third country. A list of the third parties who place cookies on the Satchel Platform can be found here.
