In some of these countries, the privacy and data protection laws and rules regarding when government authorities may access data may vary from those in the country where you live.

3\. HOW WE USE COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES

Our website may use cookies and similar tracking technology to automatically collect and receive certain technical and usage information such as internet protocol address, browser, internet service provider and device type when you connect with our Services. Cookies are small packets of data that a website stores on your hard drive so that your device will remember information about your visit. The data collected through cookies and similar tracking technology enables us to personalize your experience with the Services, understand how you use them, maintain a persistent session, improve, and further develop the Services, and measure and optimize advertising and promotional effectiveness. We may use session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser), and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them). Most browsers and mobile devices allow you to manage cookies in the settings. If you refuse a cookie, or if you delete cookies from your device, you may lose functionality and/or experience some inconvenience in your use of our Services. For example, you may not be able to sign in and access your account as quickly, or we may not be able to recognize you, your device, or your online preferences. Furthermore, if you use a different device, change browsers, or delete the opt-out cookies that contain your preferences, you may need to perform the opt-out task again. For more information, see [ACCESSING AND MODIFYING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION](javascript:void(0)).

4\. HOW WE SHARE, TRANSFER AND PUBLICLY DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION

We do not disclose your private personal information except in the limited circumstances described here.

**Service providers.**  We engage service providers to perform certain functions and provide certain services. For example, we use a variety of third-party services to help us understand and improve the use of our Services, such as Google Analytics. We may share your private personal information with these service providers, subject to our obligations to adhere to this Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures, and on the condition that the third parties use your private personal data only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions. We share your payment information, including your credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing address with payment services providers to process payments, prevent, detect and investigate fraud or other prohibited activities, facilitate dispute resolution such as chargebacks or refunds, and for other purposes associated with the acceptance of credit or debit cards.

**Law and harm.**  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Policy, we may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, legal processes, or governmental requests; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect our or our users’ rights or property. However, nothing in this Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to the request of a third-party, including a government, to disclose your information.

**Business transfers and affiliates.**  In the event that we are involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. This Policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity. We may also disclose information about you to our corporate affiliates, including our affiliates that provide financial services, in order to help provide, understand, and improve our Services and our affiliates’ services.

**Public information.**  We may share or disclose your public information, such as your public user profile information and public comments.

5\. HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION

Webull uses reasonable, industry standard security measures to protect information under our control from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. We maintain appropriate physical, electronic and procedural safeguards, including restricting access to personal information on a need-to-know basis, and limiting the amount and type of information available for downloading or transmittal. We also regularly conduct audits to ensure the effectiveness of our system. Please understand, however, that no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent hackers from illegally obtaining this information, or that our database and/or systems will not be subject to a cyber-attack.

We have established a data breach management plan. If there is a data breach involving the personal information of our users, we will activate the data breach management plan to contain the data breach to prevent data from being further compromised and take appropriate measures to inform you, including in the form of push notifications, public announcements, or other appropriate means.

You acknowledge that no safeguards are guaranteed to be completely effective. We strongly suggest that you perform all uploads in a secure internet environment and use a strong password for your account. Please contact us (see [HOW TO CONTACT US](javascript:void(0)) below) immediately if you have reason to believe your account security has in any way been compromised.

Webull retains your personal information for as long as necessary to accomplish the purpose for which it was collected, to meet our legal and regulatory obligations including compliance with our records retention practices, or as required or permitted by applicable laws and as permitted to meet our legitimate interests.

6\. ACCESSING AND MODIFYING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

If you are a registered user of our Services, we provide you with tools and account settings to access, correct, delete, or modify the personal information you provided to us in connection with your account. You also can download certain account information, including your portfolio.

You can permanently delete your Webull account. When your account has been deactivated, information relating to your account, including your name, username, and public profile, is no longer viewable on our Services, including the Webull app. For up to 30 days after deactivation it is still possible to restore your account if it was accidentally or wrongfully deactivated. Absent a separate arrangement between you and us to extend your deactivation period, after 30 days, we will begin the process of deleting your account from our systems, which can take up to a week.

Keep in mind that search engines and other third-parties may still retain copies of your public information, such as any posts and comments you made in the Webull Community, even after you have deleted the information from the Services or deactivated your account.

7\. HOW WE PROTECT THE INFORMATION OF MINORS

The Services are not directed to children, we do not intentionally collect information from children, and we request that children not provide any personal information to us. If you have any concerns about your child’s privacy, please contact us (see [HOW TO CONTACT US](javascript:void(0)) below). Should we discover that we have unintentionally collected personal information from your child without your consent, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.

8\. HOW YOUR INFORMATION MOVES GLOBALLY

We store your personal information on servers in the country or region that we provide our Services from and you will be deemed to accept their jurisdiction over your information.

Our products and Services are available across a number jurisdictions, each of which has different data protection laws that vary in the amount of protection they provide. In all cases, we will make reasonable efforts to ensure that your personal information is adequately and equally protected. In providing our Services, your personal information may be accessed by our affiliates in jurisdictions other than where you use our Services.

Webull will not transfer any personal data relating to a natural person located in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, or any other jurisdiction that restricts outbound data transfer, from the country of origin without appropriate safeguards as required by applicable law and regulations. You may receive a copy of those safeguards by contacting us (see [HOW TO CONTACT US](javascript:void(0)) below).

9\. CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS

Under the CCPA, California residents have certain rights (set forth below) regarding their personal information.

To make such a request, please contact us. Please be advised that we will verify all such requests prior to providing any personal information including by requiring you to respond to an email sent to the email you used when making your request and/or the email that pertains to your account. Please be advised that we are only required to respond to two requests per consumer each year. These reports will be provided free of charge.

**Right to opt out of the "sale" of personal information.**  California residents have the right to request that we not sell their personal information to third parties, as those terms are defined by California Civil Code Section 1798.140. We do not sell information about you to third parties. In order to help us deliver advertising and marketing on other platforms, we do allow third parties to collect information through our Services.

In the past twelve months, we collected personal information as described in [THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT](javascript:void(0)) above. We share this information as described in [HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION](javascript:void(0)) above.

**Nondiscrimination.**  We will not discriminate against California residents who exercise their privacy rights.

**Authorized agent.**  California residents may use an authorized agent to make requests on their behalf. We require the authorized agent to provide us with proof of the California resident’s written permission (for example, a power of attorney) that shows the authorized agent has the authority to submit a request for the California resident. In addition to providing this proof, the authorized agent must follow the appropriate process described above to make a request.

**California shine the light law.**  We do not share your personal information with other businesses or third parties for their own direct marketing purposes.

**Do not track notice.**  We do not currently respond or take any action with respect to web browser "do not track" signals or other mechanisms that provide users the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personal information about that user’s online activities over time and across third-party web sites or online services. We may allow third parties, such as companies that provide us with analytics tools, to collect personal information about your online activities over time and across different apps or web sites when you use our Services.
