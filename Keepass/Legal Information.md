----------------------------------------

### Content

The author reserves the right not to be responsible for the topicality, correctness, completeness or quality of the information provided. Liability claims against the author relating to material or non-material damage caused by the use or non-use of the information provided or by the use of incorrect or incomplete information are generally excluded, unless it can be proven that the author acted intentionally or with gross negligence.

All offers are subject to change and non-binding. The author expressly reserves the right to change, extend or delete parts of the pages or the entire publication or to cease the publication temporarily or permanently without separate announcement.

  

### Referrals and Links

In the case of direct or indirect referrals and links to external websites that lie outside the author's area of responsibility, liability would only come into force if the author had knowledge of the content and it were technically possible and reasonable for him to prevent use in the case of illegal content.

The author hereby expressly declares that at the time of setting the referral or link no illegal content was discernible on the referred/linked pages. The author has no influence whatsoever on the current and future design, content or authorship of the referred/linked pages. Therefore, he hereby expressly dissociates himself from all contents of all referred/linked pages which were changed after the referral or link setting. This statement applies to all referrals and links within the author's own Internet offer as well as to foreign entries in guest books, discussion forums, link directories, mailing lists and all other forms of databases set up by the author to whose content external write accesses are possible. For illegal, incorrect or incomplete contents and in particular for damages arising from the use or non-use of information presented in this way, only the provider of the page to which the referral/link was made is liable, not the person who merely refers/links to the respective publication.

  

### Copyright and Trademark Rights

The author endeavours to respect applicable copyrights in all publications. However, if in spite of all efforts a copyright is violated, we will remove the relevant item from the publication on notification or will insert information on the copyright.

All brands and trademarks mentioned within the publication that are subject to property rights of third parties are subject to the provisions of the applicable trademark law and the property rights of the registered owner without restriction. The mere mention of a trademark does not imply that it is not protected by third-party rights.

The copyright for any material (images, diagrams, sounds, videos, texts, etc.) created by the author is reserved. Any duplication or use of such material in other electronic or printed publications is not permitted without the author's explicit consent.

  

### Privacy

#### Controller

See [Imprint](https://keepass.info/contact.html).

  

#### General Information on Data Processing

If the opportunity for the input of personal or business data (e-mail addresses, name, addresses) is given, the input of this data takes place voluntarily. The use and payment of all offered services is permitted – if and so far technically possible and reasonable – without specification of any personal data or under specification of anonymized data or an alias.

The use of published postal addresses, telephone or fax numbers and e-mail addresses for marketing purposes is prohibited. We expressly reserve the right to take legal action against senders of so-called spam mails who violate this prohibition.

##### Scope of Processing of Personal Data

We only process personal data of our users if this is necessary to provide a functional website as well as our contents and services. The processing of personal data of our users takes place regularly only after consent of the user. An exception applies in those cases where prior consent cannot be obtained for real reasons and the processing of the data is permitted by law.

##### Legal Basis for the Processing of Personal Data

* If we obtain the consent of the data subject for the processing of personal data, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) serves as the legal basis.
* In the processing of personal data required for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR serves as the legal basis. This also applies to processing operations that are necessary to carry out pre-contractual measures.
* If the processing of personal data is necessary to comply with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR serves as the legal basis.
* In the event that the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person require the processing of personal data, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. d GDPR serves as the legal basis.
* If the processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party and if the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not outweigh the former interest, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR serves as the legal basis.

##### Data Erasure and Storage Time

The personal data of the data subject will be erased or blocked as soon as the purpose of storage ceases to apply. The data may be stored beyond that if the European or national legislator has provided for this in EU regulations, laws or other provisions to which the controller is subject. The data will also be erased or blocked if a storage period prescribed by the aforementioned standards expires, unless there is a need for further storage of the data for the conclusion or performance of a contract.

  

#### Provision of the Website and Creation of Log Files

Every time you visit our website, our system automatically collects data and information of the calling computer. The following data is collected:

1. Information about the browser type and version used.
2. The user's operating system.
3. The user's Internet service provider.
4. The IP address of the user.
5. Date and time of access.
6. Websites from which the user's system reaches our website.
7. Websites that are accessed by the user's system via our website.

The data is also stored in the log files of our system. This data is not stored together with other personal data of the user.

The temporary storage of the IP address by the system is necessary to enable the website to be delivered to the user's computer. For this the IP address of the user must remain stored for the duration of the session.

The data is stored in log files to ensure the functionality of the website. In addition, the data serves us to optimize the website and to ensure the security of our information technology systems. An evaluation of the data for marketing purposes does not take place in this context.

The legal basis for the temporary storage of the data and the log files is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. Our legitimate interests lie in the above-mentioned purposes.

The data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer necessary to achieve the purpose for which they were collected:

* In the case of the collection of data for the provision of the website, this is the case when the respective session has ended.
* In the case of storing the data in log files, this is the case after seven days at the latest. Further storage is possible; in this case, the IP addresses of the users are erased or anonymized, so that an association of the calling client is no longer possible.

The collection of the data for the provision of the website and the storage of the data in log files is absolutely necessary for the operation of the website. Consequently, there is no possibility of objection on the part of the user.

  

#### Cookies

Our website uses cookies. Cookies are text files that are stored in the browser or by the browser on the user's computer system. If a user visits a website, a cookie may be stored on the user's system. This cookie may contain a characteristic string that uniquely identifies the browser when you return to the website.

We use cookies to make our website more user-friendly. Some elements of our website require that the calling browser can be identified even after a page change.

The following data is stored and transmitted in the cookies:

* Third-party data (see below).

The purpose of using technically necessary cookies is to simplify the use of websites for users. Some functions of our website cannot be offered without the use of cookies. For this it is necessary that the browser is recognized even after a page change.

We need cookies for the following applications:

* Third-party applications (see below).

The user data collected via technically necessary cookies are not used to create user profiles.

The legal basis for the processing of personal data using cookies is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. Our legitimate interests lie in the above-mentioned purposes.

The user's computer stores and transmits cookies. Therefore, you as a user also have full control over the use of cookies. You can deactivate or restrict the transmission of cookies by changing the settings in your browser. Cookies that have already been saved can be erased at any time. This can also be done automatically. Please consult the documentation of your browser. Links to the cookie management documentations of some popular browsers:

#### Advertising

We use third-party advertising companies via [Google AdSense](https://adsense.google.com/) (provided by [Google](https://www.google.com/) and its partners) to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

When you visit a page on our website, your browser contacts the third party servers. The third party vendors obtain among other things your IP address, the browser type and the address (URL) of the visited page. The third party vendors may also use cookies, unique identifiers and other data. Your personal data and information on your device (cookies, etc.) may be processed (stored, accessed, shared and used) by this website, Google and its partners among other things for personalization of ads and content, ad and content measurement, audience insights and product development.

For more information about the data/methods and how you can prevent this data from being used by the third parties, see:

* [Google: Advertising](https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads).
* [Google: How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites).
* [Google: How Google uses cookies](https://policies.google.com/technologies/cookies).

In certain countries, a data processing consent dialog is displayed before showing ads. This is a Consent Management Platform (CMP) provided by Google ([certified](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/13554116)), compliant with the [IAB's Transparency and Consent Framework](https://iabeurope.eu/transparency-consent-framework/) (TCF); the TCF CMP ID is 300. The dialog typically shows detailed information (which data is processed, purposes, third party vendors, etc.) and allows you to configure in detail how your data is processed. You can reopen the dialog at any time (to review/change your privacy settings) by clicking the privacy settings link at the bottom of a page that displays ads (there are no ads on the 'Legal Documentation' page).

You can also delete/block cookies via your browser settings, see the section '[Cookies](#cookies)'.

The legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a/f GDPR; our website is financed by advertising.

  

#### Contact Form and E-Mail Contact

There is a contact form on our website, which can be used for electronic contact. When a user takes advantage of this possibility, the data entered in the input mask is transmitted to us and stored. At the time the message is sent, the current date and time are also stored.

Alternatively, it is possible to contact us via the e-mail address provided. In this case, the user's personal data transmitted by e-mail is stored.

In this context, the data is not passed on to third parties.

The data is used only to process the contact or conversation.

The legal basis for the processing of the data is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR. Our legitimate interests lie in the above-mentioned purposes. If the contact is aimed at the conclusion of a contract, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR is an additional legal basis.

If a legal archiving obligation applies, the data is stored for the prescribed duration. Otherwise, the data are erased as soon as they are no longer necessary to achieve the purposes of their collection. For the personal data sent via contact form or e-mail, this is the case when the conversation with the user is finished. The conversation is finished when the circumstances indicate that the matter in question has been finally clarified.

You have the possibility to object to the storage of your personal data at any time. To do this, send an appropriate e-mail to the controller. In this case, all data stored in the course of the contact or conversation will be erased without undue delay, and the conversation cannot be continued.

  

#### Rights of the Data Subject

If your personal data is processed, you are a data subject in terms of the GDPR and have the following rights.

##### Right of Access

You can ask the controller to confirm whether personal data concerning you is processed by us.

If such processing takes place, you can request the following information from the controller:

1. the purposes of the processing;
2. the categories of personal data concerned;
3. the recipients or categories of recipient to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed;
4. the envisaged period for which the personal data will be stored, if possible, or otherwise the criteria used to determine that period;

6. the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;
7. where the personal data are not collected from the data subject, any available information as to their source;
8. the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Art. 22 para. 1 and 4 GDPR and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject.

You have the right to request information as to whether the personal data concerning you is transferred to a third country or to an international organization. In this context, pursuant to Art. 46 GDPR you may request to be informed of the appropriate safeguards relating to the transfer.

##### Right to Rectification

You have the right to rectification and/or completion if the personal data processed concerning you is incorrect or incomplete. The controller shall make the correction without undue delay.

##### Right to Restriction of Processing

Under the following conditions, you may request the restriction of the processing of personal data concerning you:

1. if you contest the accuracy of the personal data, for a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data;
2. the processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of the personal data and request the restriction of their use instead;
3. the controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but they are required by you for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims;
4. you object to processing pursuant to Art. 21 para. 1 GDPR pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of the controller override yours.

Where processing has been restricted, your personal data shall, with the exception of storage, only be processed with your consent or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the Union or of a Member State.

If processing has been restricted pursuant to the above conditions, you will be informed by the controller before the restriction is lifted.

##### Right to Erasure

_Erasure Obligation._ You have the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning you without undue delay. The controller has the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay where one of the following grounds applies:

1. The personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed.
2. You withdraw your consent on which the processing is based (according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR), and where there is no other legal ground for the processing.
3. You object to the processing pursuant to Art. 21 para. 1 GDPR and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or you object to the processing pursuant to Art. 21 para. 2 GDPR.
4. The personal data have been unlawfully processed.
5. The personal data have to be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject.
6. The personal data have been collected in relation to the offer of information society services referred to in Art. 8 para. 1 GDPR.

_Information to Third Parties._ Where the controller has made the personal data public and is obliged pursuant to Art. 17 para. 1 GDPR to erase the personal data, the controller, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, shall take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform controllers which are processing the personal data that you have requested the erasure by such controllers of any links to, or copy or replication of, those personal data.

_Exceptions._ The right to erasure does not apply where processing is necessary

1. for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information;
2. for compliance with a legal obligation which requires processing by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;
3. for reasons of public interest in the area of public health in accordance with Art. 9 para. 2 lit. h and i as well as Art. 9 para. 3 GDPR;
4. for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with Art. 89 para. 1 GDPR in so far as the right referred to in Art. 17 para. 1 GDPR is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the objectives of that processing;
5. for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

##### Right to Notification

The controller communicates any rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing carried out in accordance with Art. 16, Art. 17 para. 1 and Art. 18 GDPR to each recipient to whom the personal data have been disclosed, unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort.

You have the right to request to be informed about those recipients by the controller.

##### Right to Data Portability

You have the right to receive the personal data concerning you, which you have provided to the controller, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit those data to another controller without hindrance from the controller to which the personal data have been provided, where

1. the processing is based on consent pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR or on a contract pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR, and
2. the processing is carried out by automated means.

In exercising this right, you further have the right to have the personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another, where technically feasible. Freedoms and rights of others must not be affected adversely.

The right to data portability does not apply to processing necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.

##### Right to Object

You have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to processing of personal data concerning you which is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. e or f GDPR, including profiling based on those provisions.

The controller no longer processes your personal data unless the controller demonstrates compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

Where personal data are processed for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time to processing of personal data concerning you for such marketing, which includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing.

If you object to processing for direct marketing purposes, your personal data is no longer processed for such purposes.

In the context of the use of information society services, and notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC, you may exercise your right to object by automated means using technical specifications.

##### Right to Withdraw the Data Protection Declaration of Consent

You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.

##### Automated Individual Decision-Making, Including Profiling

You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affects you. This does not apply if the decision

1. is necessary for entering into, or performance of, a contract between you and the controller;
2. is authorised by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject and which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard your rights and freedoms and legitimate interests; or
3. is based on your explicit consent.

However, these decisions are not based on special categories of personal data referred to in Art. 9 para. 1 GDPR, unless Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a or g GDPR applies and suitable measures to safeguard your rights and freedoms and legitimate interests are in place.

In the cases 1. and 3., the data controller implements suitable measures to safeguard your rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, at least the right to obtain human intervention on the part of the controller, to express your point of view and to contest the decision.

##### Right to Lodge a Complaint With a Supervisory Authority

Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of your habitual residence, place of work or place of the alleged infringement if you consider that the processing of personal data relating to you infringes the GDPR.

The supervisory authority with which the complaint has been lodged informs the complainant on the progress and the outcome of the complaint including the possibility of a judicial remedy pursuant to Art. 78 GDPR.

### Inhalt

Der Autor übernimmt keinerlei Gewähr für die Aktualität, Korrektheit, Vollständigkeit oder Qualität der bereitgestellten Informationen. Haftungsansprüche gegen den Autor, welche sich auf Schäden materieller oder nicht-materieller Art beziehen, die durch die Nutzung oder Nichtnutzung der dargebotenen Informationen bzw. durch die Nutzung fehlerhafter oder unvollständiger Informationen verursacht wurden, sind grundsätzlich ausgeschlossen, sofern seitens des Autors kein nachweislich vorsätzliches oder grob fahrlässiges Verschulden vorliegt.

Alle Angebote sind freibleibend und unverbindlich. Der Autor behält es sich ausdrücklich vor, Teile der Seiten oder das gesamte Angebot ohne gesonderte Ankündigung zu verändern, zu ergänzen, zu löschen oder die Veröffentlichung zeitweise oder endgültig einzustellen.

  

### Verweise und Links

Bei direkten oder indirekten Verweisen und Links auf fremde Webseiten, die außerhalb des Verantwortungsbereiches des Autors liegen, würde eine Haftungsverpflichtung ausschließlich in dem Fall in Kraft treten, in dem der Autor von den Inhalten Kenntnis hat und es ihm technisch möglich und zumutbar wäre, die Nutzung im Falle rechtswidriger Inhalte zu verhindern.

Der Autor erklärt hiermit ausdrücklich, dass zum Zeitpunkt der Verweis- bzw. Linksetzung keine illegalen Inhalte auf den verwiesenen/verlinkten Seiten erkennbar waren. Auf die aktuelle und zukünftige Gestaltung, die Inhalte oder die Urheberschaft der verwiesenen/verlinkten Seiten hat der Autor keinerlei Einfluss. Deshalb distanziert er sich hiermit ausdrücklich von allen Inhalten aller verwiesenen/verlinkten Seiten, die nach der Verweis- bzw. Linksetzung verändert wurden. Diese Feststellung gilt für alle innerhalb des eigenen Internetangebotes gesetzten Verweise und Links sowie für Fremdeinträge in vom Autor eingerichteten Gästebüchern, Diskussionsforen, Linkverzeichnissen, Mailinglisten und in allen anderen Formen von Datenbanken, auf deren Inhalt externe Schreibzugriffe möglich sind. Für illegale, fehlerhafte oder unvollständige Inhalte und insbesondere für Schäden, die aus der Nutzung oder Nichtnutzung solcherart dargebotener Informationen entstehen, haftet allein der Anbieter der Seite, auf welche verwiesen wurde, nicht derjenige, der über Verweise oder Links auf die jeweilige Veröffentlichung lediglich verweist.

  

### Urheber- und Kennzeichenrecht

Der Autor ist bestrebt, in allen Publikationen geltende Urheberrechte zu beachten. Sollte es trotzdem zu einer Urheberrechtsverletzung kommen, werden wir das entsprechende Objekt nach Benachrichtigung aus unserer Publikation entfernen oder Informationen zum Urheberrecht hinzufügen.

Alle innerhalb des Internetangebots genannten und ggf. durch Dritte geschützten Marken- und Warenzeichen unterliegen uneingeschränkt den Bestimmungen des jeweils gültigen Kennzeichenrechts und den Besitzrechten der jeweiligen eingetragenen Eigentümer. Allein aufgrund der bloßen Nennung ist nicht der Schluss zu ziehen, dass Markenzeichen nicht durch Rechte Dritter geschützt sind.

Das Copyright für veröffentlichte, vom Autor selbst erstellte Objekte (Bilder, Grafiken, Tondokumente, Videosequenzen, Texte, usw.) bleibt allein beim Autor der Seiten. Eine Vervielfältigung oder Verwendung solcher Objekte in anderen elektronischen oder gedruckten Publikationen ist ohne ausdrückliche Zustimmung des Autors nicht gestattet.

  

### Datenschutz

#### Verantwortlicher

Siehe [Impressum](https://keepass.info/contact.html).

  

#### Allgemeines zur Datenverarbeitung

Sofern innerhalb des Internetangebotes die Möglichkeit zur Eingabe persönlicher oder geschäftlicher Daten (E-Mail-Adressen, Namen, Anschriften) besteht, so erfolgt die Preisgabe dieser Daten seitens des Nutzers auf ausdrücklich freiwilliger Basis. Die Inanspruchnahme und Bezahlung aller angebotenen Dienste ist – soweit technisch möglich und zumutbar – auch ohne Angabe solcher Daten bzw. unter Angabe anonymisierter Daten oder eines Pseudonyms gestattet.

Die Nutzung der im Rahmen des Impressums oder vergleichbarer Angaben veröffentlichten Kontaktdaten wie Postanschriften, Telefon- und Faxnummern sowie E-Mail-Adressen durch Dritte zur Übersendung von nicht ausdrücklich angeforderten Informationen zu Marketing-Zwecken ist nicht gestattet. Rechtliche Schritte gegen die Versender von sogenannten Spam-Mails bei Verstößen gegen dieses Verbot sind ausdrücklich vorbehalten.

##### Umfang der Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten

Wir verarbeiten personenbezogene Daten unserer Nutzer grundsätzlich nur, soweit dies zur Bereitstellung einer funktionsfähigen Website sowie unserer Inhalte und Leistungen erforderlich ist. Die Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten unserer Nutzer erfolgt regelmäßig nur nach Einwilligung des Nutzers. Eine Ausnahme gilt in solchen Fällen, in denen eine vorherige Einholung einer Einwilligung aus tatsächlichen Gründen nicht möglich ist und die Verarbeitung der Daten durch gesetzliche Vorschriften gestattet ist.

##### Rechtsgrundlage für die Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten

* Soweit wir für Verarbeitungsvorgänge personenbezogener Daten eine Einwilligung der betroffenen Person einholen, dient Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. a EU-Datenschutzgrundverordnung (DSGVO) als Rechtsgrundlage.
* Bei der Verarbeitung von personenbezogenen Daten, die zur Erfüllung eines Vertrages, dessen Vertragspartei die betroffene Person ist, erforderlich ist, dient Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. b DSGVO als Rechtsgrundlage. Dies gilt auch für Verarbeitungsvorgänge, die zur Durchführung vorvertraglicher Maßnahmen erforderlich sind.
* Soweit eine Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten zur Erfüllung einer rechtlichen Verpflichtung erforderlich ist, der der Verantwortliche unterliegt, dient Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. c DSGVO als Rechtsgrundlage.
* Für den Fall, dass lebenswichtige Interessen der betroffenen Person oder einer anderen natürlichen Person eine Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten erforderlich machen, dient Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. d DSGVO als Rechtsgrundlage.
* Ist die Verarbeitung zur Wahrung eines berechtigten Interesses des Verantwortlichen oder eines Dritten erforderlich und überwiegen die Interessen, Grundrechte und Grundfreiheiten des Betroffenen das erstgenannte Interesse nicht, so dient Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. f DSGVO als Rechtsgrundlage.

##### Datenlöschung und Speicherdauer

Die personenbezogenen Daten der betroffenen Person werden gelöscht oder gesperrt, sobald der Zweck der Speicherung entfällt. Eine Speicherung kann darüber hinaus erfolgen, wenn dies durch den europäischen oder nationalen Gesetzgeber in unionsrechtlichen Verordnungen, Gesetzen oder sonstigen Vorschriften, denen der Verantwortliche unterliegt, vorgesehen wurde. Eine Löschung oder Sperrung der Daten erfolgt auch dann, wenn eine durch die genannten Normen vorgeschriebene Speicherfrist abläuft, es sei denn, dass eine Erforderlichkeit zur weiteren Speicherung der Daten für einen Vertragsabschluss oder eine Vertragserfüllung besteht.

  

#### Bereitstellung der Website und Erstellung von Logfiles

Bei jedem Aufruf unserer Internetseite erfasst unser System automatisiert Daten und Informationen des aufrufenden Rechners. Folgende Daten werden hierbei erhoben:

1. Informationen über den Browsertyp und die verwendete Version.
2. Das Betriebssystem des Nutzers.
3. Den Internet-Service-Provider des Nutzers.
4. Die IP-Adresse des Nutzers.
5. Datum und Uhrzeit des Zugriffs.
6. Websites, von denen das System des Nutzers auf unsere Internetseite gelangt.
7. Websites, die vom System des Nutzers über unsere Website aufgerufen werden.

Die Daten werden ebenfalls in den Logfiles unseres Systems gespeichert. Eine Speicherung dieser Daten zusammen mit anderen personenbezogenen Daten des Nutzers findet nicht statt.

Die vorübergehende Speicherung der IP-Adresse durch das System ist notwendig, um eine Auslieferung der Website an den Rechner des Nutzers zu ermöglichen. Hierfür muss die IP-Adresse des Nutzers für die Dauer der Sitzung gespeichert bleiben.

Die Speicherung in Logfiles erfolgt, um die Funktionsfähigkeit der Website sicherzustellen. Zudem dienen uns die Daten zur Optimierung der Website und zur Sicherstellung der Sicherheit unserer informationstechnischen Systeme. Eine Auswertung der Daten zu Marketingzwecken findet in diesem Zusammenhang nicht statt.

Rechtsgrundlage für die vorübergehende Speicherung der Daten und der Logfiles ist Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. f DSGVO. Unsere berechtigten Interessen liegen in den oben genannten Zwecken.

Die Daten werden gelöscht, sobald sie für die Erreichung des Zweckes ihrer Erhebung nicht mehr erforderlich sind:

* Im Falle der Erfassung der Daten zur Bereitstellung der Website ist dies der Fall, wenn die jeweilige Sitzung beendet ist.
* Im Falle der Speicherung der Daten in Logfiles ist dies nach spätestens sieben Tagen der Fall. Eine darüberhinausgehende Speicherung ist möglich; in diesem Fall werden die IP-Adressen der Nutzer gelöscht oder verfremdet, sodass eine Zuordnung des aufrufenden Clients nicht mehr möglich ist.

Die Erfassung der Daten zur Bereitstellung der Website und die Speicherung der Daten in Logfiles ist für den Betrieb der Website zwingend erforderlich. Es besteht folglich seitens des Nutzers keine Widerspruchsmöglichkeit.

#### Werbung

Wir verwenden Drittanbieter von Werbung über [Google AdSense](https://adsense.google.com/) (von [Google](https://www.google.com/) und dessen Partnern bereitgestellt), um Anzeigen zu schalten, wenn Sie unsere Website besuchen. Diese Unternehmen nutzen möglicherweise Informationen zu Ihren Besuchen dieser und anderer Websites, damit Anzeigen zu Produkten und Diensten geschaltet werden können, die Sie interessieren.

Beim Aufruf einer Seite unserer Website kontaktiert Ihr Browser die Drittanbieter-Server. Hierbei erfahren die Drittanbieter unter anderem Ihre IP-Adresse, den Browsertyp und die Adresse (URL) der aufgerufenen Seite. Die Drittanbieter können auch Cookies, eindeutige Identifikatoren und weitere Daten verwenden. Ihre persönlichen Daten und Informationen auf Ihrem Gerät (Cookies, usw.) können von dieser Website, Google und dessen Partnern unter anderem für die Personalisierung von Anzeigen und Inhalten, die Messung von Anzeigen und Inhalten, Einblicke in die Zielgruppe und die Produktentwicklung verarbeitet (gespeichert, abgerufen, weitergegeben und verwendet) werden.

Weitere Informationen über die Daten/Methoden und darüber, welche Möglichkeiten Sie haben, damit diese Daten nicht von den Drittanbietern verwendet werden können, finden Sie hier:

* [Google: Werbung](https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads).
* [Google: Wie wir Daten von Websites oder Apps verwenden, auf bzw. in denen unsere Dienste genutzt werden](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites).
* [Google: So verwendet Google Cookies](https://policies.google.com/technologies/cookies).
* [Google: Datenschutzerklärung](https://policies.google.com/privacy).
* [Google: Rechtliche Rahmenbedingungen für Datenübermittlungen](https://policies.google.com/privacy/frameworks) (Zertifizierungen, usw.).

* [Digital Advertising Alliance: WebChoices](https://optout.aboutads.info/) (Drittanbieter-Cookies verwalten).

In bestimmten Ländern wird vor der Anzeige von Werbung ein Dialog zur Einwilligung in die Datenverarbeitung angezeigt. Dabei handelt es sich um eine von Google bereitgestellte Consent Management Platform (CMP, [zertifiziert](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/13554116)), die mit dem [Transparency and Consent Framework](https://iabeurope.eu/transparency-consent-framework/) (TCF) des IAB konform ist; die TCF CMP ID lautet 300. Der Dialog zeigt üblicherweise detaillierte Informationen an (welche Daten verarbeitet werden, Zwecke, Drittanbieter, usw.) und ermöglicht es Ihnen, im Detail zu konfigurieren, wie Ihre Daten verarbeitet werden. Sie können den Dialog jederzeit erneut öffnen (um Ihre Datenschutzeinstellungen zu überprüfen/ändern), indem Sie auf den Link für die Datenschutzeinstellungen am Ende einer Seite klicken, auf der Werbung angezeigt wird (auf der Seite 'Legal Documentation' gibt es keine Werbung).

Sie können Cookies auch über Ihre Browsereinstellungen löschen/blockieren, siehe den Abschnitt '[Cookies](#cookies_de)'.

Die Rechtsgrundlage ist Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. a/f DSGVO; unsere Website wird durch die Werbung finanziert.

  

#### Kontaktformular und E-Mail-Kontakt

Auf unserer Internetseite ist ein Kontaktformular vorhanden, welches für die elektronische Kontaktaufnahme genutzt werden kann. Nimmt ein Nutzer diese Möglichkeit wahr, so werden die in der Eingabemaske eingegebenen Daten an uns übermittelt und gespeichert. Zum Zeitpunkt der Absendung der Nachricht werden zudem das aktuelle Datum und die aktuelle Uhrzeit gespeichert.

Alternativ ist eine Kontaktaufnahme über die bereitgestellte E-Mail-Adresse möglich. In diesem Fall werden die mit der E-Mail übermittelten personenbezogenen Daten des Nutzers gespeichert.

Es erfolgt in diesem Zusammenhang keine Weitergabe der Daten an Dritte.

Die Daten dienen allein zur Bearbeitung der Kontaktaufnahme bzw. Konversation.

Die Rechtsgrundlage für die Verarbeitung der Daten ist Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. f DSGVO. Unsere berechtigten Interessen liegen in den oben genannten Zwecken. Zielt der Kontakt auf den Abschluss eines Vertrages ab, so ist Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. b DSGVO eine zusätzliche Rechtsgrundlage.

Falls eine gesetzliche Archivierungspflicht gilt, werden die Daten für die vorgeschriebene Dauer gespeichert. Anderenfalls werden die Daten gelöscht, sobald sie für die Erreichung der Zwecke ihrer Erhebung nicht mehr erforderlich sind. Für die personenbezogenen Daten, die per Kontaktformular oder E-Mail übersandt wurden, ist dies dann der Fall, wenn die jeweilige Konversation mit dem Nutzer beendet ist. Beendet ist die Konversation dann, wenn sich aus den Umständen entnehmen lässt, dass der betroffene Sachverhalt abschließend geklärt ist.

Sie haben jederzeit die Möglichkeit, der Speicherung Ihrer personenbezogenen Daten zu widersprechen. Senden Sie dazu eine entsprechende E-Mail an den Verantwortlichen. In diesem Fall werden alle Daten, die im Zuge der Kontaktaufnahme bzw. Konversation gespeichert wurden, unverzüglich gelöscht, und die Konversation kann nicht fortgeführt werden.

  

#### Rechte der betroffenen Person

Werden personenbezogene Daten von Ihnen verarbeitet, sind Sie Betroffener im Sinne der DSGVO und es stehen Ihnen die folgenden Rechte zu.

##### Auskunftsrecht

Sie können von dem Verantwortlichen eine Bestätigung darüber verlangen, ob personenbezogene Daten, die Sie betreffen, von uns verarbeitet werden.

Liegt eine solche Verarbeitung vor, können Sie von dem Verantwortlichen über folgende Informationen Auskunft verlangen:

1. die Verarbeitungszwecke;
2. die Kategorien von personenbezogenen Daten, welche verarbeitet werden;
3. die Empfänger bzw. die Kategorien von Empfängern, gegenüber denen die Sie betreffenden personenbezogenen Daten offengelegt wurden oder noch offengelegt werden;
4. die geplante Dauer der Speicherung der Sie betreffenden personenbezogenen Daten oder, falls konkrete Angaben hierzu nicht möglich sind, Kriterien für die Festlegung der Speicherdauer;
5. das Bestehen eines Rechts auf Berichtigung oder Löschung der Sie betreffenden personenbezogenen Daten, eines Rechts auf Einschränkung der Verarbeitung durch den Verantwortlichen oder eines Widerspruchsrechts gegen diese Verarbeitung;
6. das Bestehen eines Beschwerderechts bei einer Aufsichtsbehörde;
7. alle verfügbaren Informationen über die Herkunft der Daten, wenn die personenbezogenen Daten nicht bei der betroffenen Person erhoben werden;
8. das Bestehen einer automatisierten Entscheidungsfindung einschließlich Profiling gemäß Art. 22 Abs. 1 und 4 DSGVO und – zumindest in diesen Fällen – aussagekräftige Informationen über die involvierte Logik sowie die Tragweite und die angestrebten Auswirkungen einer derartigen Verarbeitung für die betroffene Person.

Ihnen steht das Recht zu, Auskunft darüber zu verlangen, ob die Sie betreffenden personenbezogenen Daten in ein Drittland oder an eine internationale Organisation übermittelt werden. In diesem Zusammenhang können Sie verlangen, gemäß Art. 46 DSGVO über die geeigneten Garantien im Zusammenhang mit der Übermittlung unterrichtet zu werden.

##### Recht auf Berichtigung

Sie haben das Recht auf Berichtigung und/oder Vervollständigung, sofern die verarbeiteten personenbezogenen Daten, die Sie betreffen, unrichtig oder unvollständig sind. Der Verantwortliche hat die Berichtigung unverzüglich vorzunehmen.

##### Recht auf Einschränkung der Verarbeitung

Unter den folgenden Voraussetzungen können Sie die Einschränkung der Verarbeitung der Sie betreffenden personenbezogenen Daten verlangen:

1. wenn Sie die Richtigkeit der Sie betreffenden personenbezogenen Daten für eine Dauer bestreiten, die es dem Verantwortlichen ermöglicht, die Richtigkeit der personenbezogenen Daten zu überprüfen;
2. die Verarbeitung unrechtmäßig ist und Sie die Löschung der personenbezogenen Daten ablehnen und stattdessen die Einschränkung der Nutzung der personenbezogenen Daten verlangen;
3. der Verantwortliche die personenbezogenen Daten für die Zwecke der Verarbeitung nicht länger benötigt, Sie diese jedoch zur Geltendmachung, Ausübung oder Verteidigung von Rechtsansprüchen benötigen;
4. wenn Sie Widerspruch gegen die Verarbeitung gemäß Art. 21 Abs. 1 DSGVO eingelegt haben und noch nicht feststeht, ob die berechtigten Gründe des Verantwortlichen gegenüber Ihren Gründen überwiegen.

Wurde die Verarbeitung der Sie betreffenden personenbezogenen Daten eingeschränkt, dürfen diese Daten – von ihrer Speicherung abgesehen – nur mit Ihrer Einwilligung oder zur Geltendmachung, Ausübung oder Verteidigung von Rechtsansprüchen oder zum Schutz der Rechte einer anderen natürlichen oder juristischen Person oder aus Gründen eines wichtigen öffentlichen Interesses der Union oder eines Mitgliedstaats verarbeitet werden.

Wurde die Verarbeitung nach den o.g. Voraussetzungen eingeschränkt, werden Sie von dem Verantwortlichen unterrichtet bevor die Einschränkung aufgehoben wird.

##### Recht auf Löschung

_Löschungspflicht._ Sie können von dem Verantwortlichen verlangen, dass die Sie betreffenden personenbezogenen Daten unverzüglich gelöscht werden. Der Verantwortliche ist verpflichtet, diese Daten unverzüglich zu löschen, sofern einer der folgenden Gründe zutrifft:

1. Die Sie betreffenden personenbezogenen Daten sind für die Zwecke, für die sie erhoben oder auf sonstige Weise verarbeitet wurden, nicht mehr notwendig.
2. Sie widerrufen Ihre Einwilligung, auf die sich die Verarbeitung (gemäß Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. a oder Art. 9 Abs. 2 lit. a DSGVO) stützte, und es fehlt an einer anderweitigen Rechtsgrundlage für die Verarbeitung.
3. Sie legen gemäß Art. 21 Abs. 1 DSGVO Widerspruch gegen die Verarbeitung ein und es liegen keine vorrangigen berechtigten Gründe für die Verarbeitung vor, oder Sie legen gemäß Art. 21 Abs. 2 DSGVO Widerspruch gegen die Verarbeitung ein.
4. Die Sie betreffenden personenbezogenen Daten wurden unrechtmäßig verarbeitet.
5. Die Löschung der Sie betreffenden personenbezogenen Daten ist zur Erfüllung einer rechtlichen Verpflichtung nach dem Unionsrecht oder dem Recht der Mitgliedstaaten erforderlich, dem der Verantwortliche unterliegt.
6. Die Sie betreffenden personenbezogenen Daten wurden in Bezug auf angebotene Dienste der Informationsgesellschaft gemäß Art. 8 Abs. 1 DSGVO erhoben.

_Information an Dritte._ Hat der Verantwortliche die Sie betreffenden personenbezogenen Daten öffentlich gemacht und ist er gemäß Art. 17 Abs. 1 DSGVO zu deren Löschung verpflichtet, so trifft er unter Berücksichtigung der verfügbaren Technologie und der Implementierungskosten angemessene Maßnahmen, auch technischer Art, um für die Datenverarbeitung Verantwortliche, die die personenbezogenen Daten verarbeiten, darüber zu informieren, dass Sie als betroffene Person von ihnen die Löschung aller Links zu diesen personenbezogenen Daten oder von Kopien oder Replikationen dieser personenbezogenen Daten verlangt haben.

_Ausnahmen._ Das Recht auf Löschung besteht nicht, soweit die Verarbeitung erforderlich ist

1. zur Ausübung des Rechts auf freie Meinungsäußerung und Information;
2. zur Erfüllung einer rechtlichen Verpflichtung, die die Verarbeitung nach dem Recht der Union oder der Mitgliedstaaten, dem der Verantwortliche unterliegt, erfordert, oder zur Wahrnehmung einer Aufgabe, die im öffentlichen Interesse liegt oder in Ausübung öffentlicher Gewalt erfolgt, die dem Verantwortlichen übertragen wurde;
3. aus Gründen des öffentlichen Interesses im Bereich der öffentlichen Gesundheit gemäß Art. 9 Abs. 2 lit. h und i sowie Art. 9 Abs. 3 DSGVO;
4. für im öffentlichen Interesse liegende Archivzwecke, wissenschaftliche oder historische Forschungszwecke oder für statistische Zwecke gemäß Art. 89 Abs. 1 DSGVO, soweit das unter Art. 17 Abs. 1 DSGVO genannte Recht voraussichtlich die Verwirklichung der Ziele dieser Verarbeitung unmöglich macht oder ernsthaft beeinträchtigt;
5. zur Geltendmachung, Ausübung oder Verteidigung von Rechtsansprüchen.

##### Recht auf Unterrichtung

Haben Sie das Recht auf Berichtigung, Löschung oder Einschränkung der Verarbeitung gegenüber dem Verantwortlichen geltend gemacht, ist dieser verpflichtet, allen Empfängern, denen die Sie betreffenden personenbezogenen Daten offengelegt wurden, diese Berichtigung oder Löschung der Daten oder Einschränkung der Verarbeitung mitzuteilen, es sei denn, dies erweist sich als unmöglich oder ist mit einem unverhältnismäßigen Aufwand verbunden.

Ihnen steht gegenüber dem Verantwortlichen das Recht zu, über diese Empfänger unterrichtet zu werden.

##### Recht auf Datenübertragbarkeit

Sie haben das Recht, die Sie betreffenden personenbezogenen Daten, die Sie dem Verantwortlichen bereitgestellt haben, in einem strukturierten, gängigen und maschinenlesbaren Format zu erhalten. Außerdem haben Sie das Recht diese Daten einem anderen Verantwortlichen ohne Behinderung durch den Verantwortlichen, dem die personenbezogenen Daten bereitgestellt wurden, zu übermitteln, sofern

1. die Verarbeitung auf einer Einwilligung gemäß Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. a DSGVO oder Art. 9 Abs. 2 lit. a DSGVO oder auf einem Vertrag gemäß Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. b DSGVO beruht und
2. die Verarbeitung mithilfe automatisierter Verfahren erfolgt.

In Ausübung dieses Rechts haben Sie ferner das Recht, zu erwirken, dass die Sie betreffenden personenbezogenen Daten direkt von einem Verantwortlichen einem anderen Verantwortlichen übermittelt werden, soweit dies technisch machbar ist. Freiheiten und Rechte anderer Personen dürfen hierdurch nicht beeinträchtigt werden.

Das Recht auf Datenübertragbarkeit gilt nicht für eine Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten, die für die Wahrnehmung einer Aufgabe erforderlich ist, die im öffentlichen Interesse liegt oder in Ausübung öffentlicher Gewalt erfolgt, die dem Verantwortlichen übertragen wurde.

##### Widerspruchsrecht

Sie haben das Recht, aus Gründen, die sich aus Ihrer besonderen Situation ergeben, jederzeit gegen die Verarbeitung der Sie betreffenden personenbezogenen Daten, die aufgrund von Art. 6 Abs. 1 lit. e oder f DSGVO erfolgt, Widerspruch einzulegen; dies gilt auch für ein auf diese Bestimmungen gestütztes Profiling.

Der Verantwortliche verarbeitet die Sie betreffenden personenbezogenen Daten nicht mehr, es sei denn, er kann zwingende schutzwürdige Gründe für die Verarbeitung nachweisen, die Ihre Interessen, Rechte und Freiheiten überwiegen, oder die Verarbeitung dient der Geltendmachung, Ausübung oder Verteidigung von Rechtsansprüchen.

Werden die Sie betreffenden personenbezogenen Daten verarbeitet, um Direktwerbung zu betreiben, haben Sie das Recht, jederzeit Widerspruch gegen die Verarbeitung der Sie betreffenden personenbezogenen Daten zum Zwecke derartiger Werbung einzulegen; dies gilt auch für das Profiling, soweit es mit solcher Direktwerbung in Verbindung steht.

Widersprechen Sie der Verarbeitung für Zwecke der Direktwerbung, so werden die Sie betreffenden personenbezogenen Daten nicht mehr für diese Zwecke verarbeitet.

Sie haben die Möglichkeit, im Zusammenhang mit der Nutzung von Diensten der Informationsgesellschaft – ungeachtet der Richtlinie 2002/58/EG – Ihr Widerspruchsrecht mittels automatisierter Verfahren auszuüben, bei denen technische Spezifikationen verwendet werden.

##### Recht auf Widerruf der datenschutzrechtlichen Einwilligungserklärung

Sie haben das Recht, Ihre datenschutzrechtliche Einwilligungserklärung jederzeit zu widerrufen. Durch den Widerruf der Einwilligung wird die Rechtmäßigkeit der aufgrund der Einwilligung bis zum Widerruf erfolgten Verarbeitung nicht berührt.

##### Automatisierte Entscheidung im Einzelfall einschließlich Profiling

Sie haben das Recht, nicht einer ausschließlich auf einer automatisierten Verarbeitung – einschließlich Profiling – beruhenden Entscheidung unterworfen zu werden, die Ihnen gegenüber rechtliche Wirkung entfaltet oder Sie in ähnlicher Weise erheblich beeinträchtigt. Dies gilt nicht, wenn die Entscheidung

1. für den Abschluss oder die Erfüllung eines Vertrags zwischen Ihnen und dem Verantwortlichen erforderlich ist;
2. aufgrund von Rechtsvorschriften der Union oder der Mitgliedstaaten, denen der Verantwortliche unterliegt, zulässig ist und diese Rechtsvorschriften angemessene Maßnahmen zur Wahrung Ihrer Rechte und Freiheiten sowie Ihrer berechtigten Interessen enthalten; oder
3. mit Ihrer ausdrücklichen Einwilligung erfolgt.

Allerdings dürfen diese Entscheidungen nicht auf besonderen Kategorien personenbezogener Daten nach Art. 9 Abs. 1 DSGVO beruhen, sofern nicht Art. 9 Abs. 2 lit. a oder g DSGVO gilt und angemessene Maßnahmen zum Schutz der Rechte und Freiheiten sowie Ihrer berechtigten Interessen getroffen wurden.

Hinsichtlich der in 1. und 3. genannten Fälle trifft der Verantwortliche angemessene Maßnahmen, um die Rechte und Freiheiten sowie Ihre berechtigten Interessen zu wahren, wozu mindestens das Recht auf Erwirkung des Eingreifens einer Person seitens des Verantwortlichen, auf Darlegung des eigenen Standpunkts und auf Anfechtung der Entscheidung gehört.

##### Recht auf Beschwerde bei einer Aufsichtsbehörde

Unbeschadet eines anderweitigen verwaltungsrechtlichen oder gerichtlichen Rechtsbehelfs steht Ihnen das Recht auf Beschwerde bei einer Aufsichtsbehörde, insbesondere in dem Mitgliedstaat ihres Aufenthaltsorts, ihres Arbeitsplatzes oder des Orts des mutmaßlichen Verstoßes, zu, wenn Sie der Ansicht sind, dass die Verarbeitung der Sie betreffenden personenbezogenen Daten gegen die DSGVO verstößt.

Die Aufsichtsbehörde, bei der die Beschwerde eingereicht wurde, unterrichtet den Beschwerdeführer über den Stand und die Ergebnisse der Beschwerde einschließlich der Möglichkeit eines gerichtlichen Rechtsbehelfs nach Art. 78 DSGVO.
