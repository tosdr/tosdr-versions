If you do not accept or agree to all of the Terms, do not use the Services or Software in any manner. Please also carefully read our [Privacy Policy](https://www.gtbooster.com/legal/privacy). By agreeing to the Terms, you also accept and agree to our Privacy Policy.  
  
**1.2 Acceptance of the Terms for Minors.** If you are a minor, which we consider to be an individual under the age of 16 or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction, you are permitted to access and use the Services and Software only after you and your parents (or your guardian) read, understand and accept the rights, obligations, terms and conditions in the Terms and our [Privacy Policy](https://www.gtbooster.com/legal/privacy).

We will change the “last updated” date at the top of the respective document, and, unless otherwise noted, the amended Terms will be effective immediately. It is your responsibility to review the Terms for any changes, and your access to and use of the Services and Software following any amendments to the Terms will signify your acceptance of the changes. If you do not agree to the amended Terms, you must immediately stop using the Services and Software.

### 12\. Governing Law and Jurisdiction

You agree that all matters relating to the Terms or your access to or use of the Services and Software, including all disputes, will be governed by the laws of Taiwan (R.O.C.) without regard to its conflicts of law provisions. You agree to the personal jurisdiction by and venue in the courts in Hsinchu and waive any objection to such jurisdiction or venue. The preceding provision regarding venue does not apply if you are a consumer based in the European Union. If you are a consumer based in the European Union, you may make a claim in the courts of the country where you reside.

### 13\. Dispute Resolution

**13.1 Process.** In the event of any controversy or dispute between GT Booster and you arising out of or in connection with your use of the Services or Software, the parties shall attempt, promptly and in good faith, to first resolve any such dispute informally. If we are unable to resolve any such dispute within a reasonable time (not to exceed thirty (30) days), then either party may submit such controversy or dispute to mediation. If the dispute cannot be resolved through mediation, then the parties shall be free to pursue any right or remedy available to them under applicable law. Any claim related to the Terms, Services or Software must be brought within one (1) year after the cause of action arises, or such claim or cause of action is permanently barred.  
  
**13.2 Rules.** If you reside in the Americas, the American Arbitration Association (AAA) will administer the arbitration in your county of residence pursuant to its Commercial Arbitration Rules. If you reside in Australia, New Zealand, Japan, mainland China, Hong Kong SAR of China, Macau SAR of China, Taiwan region, South Korea, India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal or a member state of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), then the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) will administer the arbitration in Singapore under its Rules of Arbitration, which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference in this section. Otherwise the London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA) will administer the arbitration in London under LCIA Arbitration Rules. There will be one arbitrator that you and GT Booster mutually select. The arbitration will be conducted in the English language, but any witness whose native language is not English may give testimony in the witness’ native language, with simultaneous translation into English (at the expense of the party presenting the witness). Judgment upon the award rendered may be entered and will be enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction having jurisdiction over you and us. Where the value of a dispute is US$10,000.00 or less, any hearing will be through a telephonic hearing unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing.  
  
**13.3 No Class Actions.** YOU MAY ONLY RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH US ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND YOU MAY NOT BRING A CLAIM AS A PLAINTIFF OR A CLASS MEMBER IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.  
  
**13.4 Injunction Relief.** Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of your or others’ unauthorized access to or use of the Services or Software in violation of the Terms, you agree that we are entitled to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.

### 14\. Miscellaneous

**14.1 English Version.** The English version of the Terms will be the version used when interpreting or construing the Terms.  
  
**14.2 No Waiver.** The failure of GT Booster to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision, nor shall any course of conduct between GT Booster and you or any other party be deemed to modify any provision of the Terms.  
  
**14.3 Severability.** If any provision of the Terms is found by a statute, regulation or court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, you nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the intentions of GT Booster and you as reflected in the provision, and that such provision shall be deemed severable and the other provisions of the Terms shall remain in full force and effect.  
  
**14.4 Headings.** The headings in the Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.  
  
**14.5 Void Where Prohibited.** Contents describing the Services and Software may be accessible worldwide, but this does not mean all Services or Software are available or appropriate for use in your country. Access to certain Services or Software in certain countries may be blocked by us or prohibited by foreign governments. It is your responsibility to make sure your use of the Services and Software is legal or available where you use them. Services and Software are not available in all languages. GT Booster reserves the right to limit, in its sole discretion, the provision and quantity of any Services or Software to any person or geographic area. Any offer for any of the Services or Software is void where prohibited.  
  
**14.6 Force Majeure.** GT Booster will not be liable for any alleged or actual loss or damages resulting from delays or failures in performance caused by your acts, acts of civil or military authority, governmental priorities, earthquake, fire, flood, epidemic, quarantine, energy crisis, strike, labor trouble, war, riot, terrorism, accident, shortage, delay in transportation, pandemic (including the Covid-19 pandemic), or any other cause beyond its reasonable control. In such instances, GT Booster shall resume the performance of its obligations as soon as reasonably possible.
