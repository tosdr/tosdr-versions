Privacy Policy
==============

**Effective date: May 14, 2018**

#### Who We Are

Evolutionary IT (“us”, “we”, or “our”) operates the https://www.evolutionaryit.com/ website (the “Service”). We provide IT and business solutions to companies in New England and worldwide.

This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.

We use your data to provide and improve the Service. By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, accessible from https://www.evolutionaryit.com/

The Evolutionary IT cares about your privacy and that is why we will never share or sell your information to any third party for any reason. Beyond this, we take steps to support organizations that are focused on impacting the global Internet to a place that respects these rights to privacy. We regularly donate to these organizations and encourage you to do the same.

Electronic Frontier Foundation is a group of passionate people — lawyers, technologists, volunteers, and visionaries — working in the trenches, battling to protect your rights and the rights of web surfers everywhere. The dedicated people of EFF challenge legislation that threatens to put a price on what is invaluable; to control what must remain boundless.

EPIC is a public interest research center in Washington, D.C. It was established in 1994 to focus public attention on emerging civil liberties issues and to protect privacy, the First Amendment, and constitutional values.
