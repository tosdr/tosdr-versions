1 Funded trees can take up to 18 months to plant, allowing for time to set up nurseries, select/expand planting sites, take advantage of optimal planting seasons and accommodate for local/regional/country social, political and health considerations. Planting trees and restoring forests are among the best ways to draw down carbon from the atmosphere, because they can help mitigate the impacts of climate change and contribute to healthy ecosystems that support wildlife and people. Trees planted by our reforestation partners are not intended to be used as carbon offsets and are not verified as such by a third party. Planted trees are part of a reforestation program where approximately 20-30% more trees are planted to account for natural survival rates and unforeseen circumstances (i.e., wildfires, natural disasters, disease) so enough trees survive to reforest an area. However, there is no guarantee all trees planted will be permanent.
