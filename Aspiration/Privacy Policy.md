##### Data Lifecycle

When you choose to open an account with Aspiration, we are required by law and regulation to retain certain Personal Information for specific amounts of time. Failure to preserve these records could result in fines and penalties, spoliation liability, contempt issues, or reputational harm. Aspiration also maintains Personal Information to provide you with our Services and for legitimate business needs.

Aspiration may delete Personal Information after its legitimate business need has passed, in accordance with law or regulation, or by your request (if your request to delete information conflicts with a legal or regulatory requirement to retain information, you may be notified).

##### Incidents and Breaches

Cyberattacks, hacks, breaches, and incidental losses of Personal Information, business assets, and computer systems are increasingly common. These attacks can be extremely damaging, particularly if Personal Information or business records have been compromised. Incidents cost companies and consumers time and money.

In the event of a Breach, Aspiration has implemented an incident response plan as required by law and regulation to document process, mitigate damage, and to notify consumers of remedial resources. Aspiration has implemented [California Code](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&sectionNum=1798.82) requirements for data breach notifications.

#### Data Rights

The CCPA grants consumers enhanced data rights regarding their Personal Information. Aspiration has implemented CCPA requirements across our business and have extended protections to all of our US-based customers.

Under the CCPA, Aspiration has implemented reasonable restrictions on Affiliates’ data sharing and selling practices.
    
    * Once you make an opt-out request, we will wait at least twelve (12) months before asking you to reauthorize personal information sales. However, you may change your mind and opt back in to Personal Information sales at any time by contacting us.
    
* Right to Delete: You have the right to request that Aspiration delete any Personal Information that we have collected and retained, subject to certain exceptions, including information needed:
    
    * to provide you Services;
    * to detect data breaches;
    * to protect our Services and business assets; and,
    * to comply with applicable federal and state laws, court orders, legal obligations, and regulatory requirements, including the CCPA.
    
* Right to Fair and Equal Treatment: You have the right to have your Personal Information be fairly and equally treated. Aspiration cannot discriminate against consumers on the basis or inference of any protected class or against consumers who have exercised their rights under this Policy.
    
    * However, as allowed under the CCPA, Aspiration may [condition](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&sectionNum=1798.125.#:~:text=1798.125.,or%20services%20to%20the%20consumer.&text=(C)%20Providing%20a%20different%20level,or%20services%20to%20the%20consumer.) financial incentive offers (promotions, referrals, bonuses, etc.) on whether you have opted-in to our data practices as described in this Policy, our [Terms of Use](https://www.aspiration.com/2024-terms-of-use), or our [Privacy Notice](https://www.aspiration.com/2024-privacy-notice).

##### Data Requests

If you have questions about any of your data rights or Aspiration’s obligations, including accessing your Personal Information, opting-out of certain practices, and/or requesting Personal Information be deleted, please send us an email at [privacy@aspiration.com](mailto:mailto:privacy@aspiration.com) or give us a call at [800-683-8529](tel:+1-800-683-8529). Aspiration endeavors to respond to requests within forty-five (45) days of receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

##### Children’s Rights

1 Funded trees can take up to 18 months to plant, allowing for time to set up nurseries, select/expand planting sites, take advantage of optimal planting seasons and accommodate for local/regional/country social, political and health considerations. Planting trees and restoring forests are among the best ways to draw down carbon from the atmosphere, because they can help mitigate the impacts of climate change and contribute to healthy ecosystems that support wildlife and people. Trees planted by our reforestation partners are not intended to be used as carbon offsets and are not verified as such by a third party. Planted trees are part of a reforestation program where approximately 20-30% more trees are planted to account for natural survival rates and unforeseen circumstances (i.e., wildfires, natural disasters, disease) so enough trees survive to reforest an area. However, there is no guarantee all trees planted will be permanent.
