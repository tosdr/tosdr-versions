ASPIRATION FINANCIAL LLC



Business Continuity Plan Disclosure Statement



Aspiration Financial, LLC Inc. has developed a Business Continuity Plan concerning how we would

respond to events that significantly disrupt our business. Since the timing and impact of disasters and

disruptions is unpredictable, we will have to be flexible in responding to actual events as they occur.

With that in mind, we are providing you with this information on our Business Continuity Plan.



Contacting us: If, after a significant business disruption, you cannot contact Aspiration Financial, LLC as

you usually do at our office number of (800) 683-8529 you may contact us via our website at

http://www.aspiration.com or by emailing support@aspiration.com. If you cannot access us through

either one of those means, we will personally contact all of our business constituents via telephone to

answer any questions you may have.



Our Business Continuity Plan: We plan to quickly recover and resume business operations after a

significant business disruption and respond by safeguarding our employees and property, making a

financial and operational assessment and protecting the Firmâ€™s books and records. In short, our

Business Continuity Plan is designed to permit our Firm to resume operations as quickly as possible,

given the scope and severity of the significant business disruptions.



Our Business Continuity Plan addresses: data back-up and recovery; all mission critical systems; financial

and operational assessments; alternative communications with customers, employees, and regulators;

alternate physical location of employees; bank impact; and regulatory reporting if we are unable to

continue our business.



Varying Disruptions: Significant business disruptions can vary in their scope, such as impacting only our

Firm, a single building housing of our Firm, the business district where our Firm is located, the city where

we are located and the whole region. In any situation, we plan to continue in business and notify you via

telephone, fax or email of how to contact us.



For more information: If you have questions about our business continuity planning or wish to review

our complete Business Continuity Plan, please contact our office and we will respond as soon as

possible.
