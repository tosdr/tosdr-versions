**Marketing**  
---------------

We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal  data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising. We have  established the following personal data control mechanisms: **Promotional offers from us**  

We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile  Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or  what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which  products, services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this  marketing).  

You will receive marketing communications from us if you have  requested information from us or purchased products or services  from us and you have not opted out of receiving that marketing via  the unsubscribe link in the bottom of the email. 

**Third-party marketing** 
--------------------------

We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your  personal data with any third party for marketing purposes.  

**Opting out** 
---------------

You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing  messages at any time by logging into the website and checking or  unchecking relevant boxes to adjust your marketing preferences, by  following the unsubscribe links on any marketing message sent to  you, or by contacting us at any time.  

Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, this will  not apply to personal data provided to us as a result of a product/ service purchase, product/service experience or other transactions. **Change of purpose**  

We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we  collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it  for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original  

purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing  for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please  contact us.  

If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we  will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to  do so, prior to carrying out any processing activities for the new  purpose. 

**Disclosures of your personal data** 
--------------------------------------

We may share your personal data with the parties set out below for  the purposes set out in the table (‘Purposes for which we will use  your personal data’) above. 

* External third parties including:

◦ Service providers acting as processors based inside and  outside the EU including Xero (accounting software),  Zapier (customer form integration tool) and Instiller (email  marketing tool).

◦ Professional advisers including lawyers, bankers,  auditors, insurers and accountants (including Brooks  Accountants) based in the United Kingdom who provide  consultancy, banking, legal, insurance and accounting  services. 

◦ HM Revenue & Customs, regulators and other authorities  based in the United Kingdom who require reporting of  processing activities in certain circumstances. 

* Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a  change happens to our business, then the new owners may  use your personal data in the same way as set out in this  privacy policy.  

We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal  data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our  third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own  purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for  specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions. **International transfers** 

We share your personal data with Thinkific Labs Inc (**Thinkific**).  Thinkific hosts this website and provides us with the online course  creation platform that allows us to sell our product/services to you  and to provide the Community section of this website. Thinkific are  based in Canada and so this will involve transferring your data  outside the United Kingdom. We may also share your personal data  with other third parties based outside of the United Kingdom.  Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the United  Kingdom, as required under the Data Protection Act 2018, we 

ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at  least one of the following safeguards is implemented:  

* We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom  recognises Canada as providing adequate protection. 
* Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the United Kingdom and European Union which give personal data the same protection it has in  the United Kingdom.  

Please contact us if you want further information on the specific  mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of  the United Kingdom.  

**Payment:** 
-------------

If you make a purchase on our website, we use a third-party  payment processor such as Stripe or Paypal. Payments are  encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security  Standard (PCI-DSS). Your purchase transaction data is stored only  

as long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction. **Data security** 

We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your  personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an  unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access  to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and  other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only 

process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject  to a duty of confidentiality.  

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected  personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable  regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so. **Data retention** 

**How long will you use my personal data for?** 
------------------------------------------------

We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably  necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the  purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or  reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a  longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe  there is a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with  you. 

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we  consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the  potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your  personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal  data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other  means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other  requirements. 

By law we have to keep basic information about our customers  (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for six  years after they cease being customers for tax purposes. In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see  ‘Your legal rights’ below for further information. 

In some circumstances we will anonymise your personal data (so  that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or  statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information  indefinitely without further notice to you.  

**Your legal rights** 
----------------------

Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection  laws in relation to your personal data. These rights are as follows: 

* Request access to your personal data.
* Request correction of your personal data.
* Request erasure of your personal data.
* Object to processing of your personal data.
* Request restriction of processing your personal data. • Request transfer of your personal data.
* Right to withdraw consent.
* Right to make a complaint.

If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please  contact our Data Protection Officer.  

**No fee usually required** 
----------------------------

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to  exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a  reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or  excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your  request in these circumstances. 

**What we may need from you** 
------------------------------

We may need to request specific information from you to help us  confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal  data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security  measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person 

who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you  for further information in relation to your request to speed up our  response. 

**Time limit to respond** 
--------------------------

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month but  without reasonable delay. Occasionally it could take us longer than  a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a  number of requests. In this case, we will notify you within the first  month of its complex nature and process it without undue delay. **Glossary** 

**LAWFUL BASIS** 
-----------------

**Legitimate Interest** means the interest of our business in  conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the  best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We  make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you  (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your  personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your  personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by  the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise  required or permitted to do so by law). You can obtain further  information about how we assess our legitimate interests against  any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by  contacting us. 

**Performance of Contract** means processing your data where it is  necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a  party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a  contract. 

**Comply with a legal obligation** means processing your personal  data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation  that we are subject to. 

**With your Consent** to process your personal data. Your consent  will be informed and freely given via an explicit action such as  clicking on a sign-up button, and maybe withdrawn at any time.

**YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS** 
----------------------

You have the right to: 

**Request access** to any personal data relating to you (commonly  known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to  receive a copy of the personal data we hold which relates to you,  allowing you to check that we are lawfully processing it. **Request correction** of the personal data that we hold about you.  This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we  hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the  accuracy of the new data you provide to us. 

**Request erasure** of your personal data. This enables you to ask us  to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason  for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to  delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully  exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we  may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are  required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note,  however, that we may not always be able to comply with your  request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to  you, if applicable, at the time of your request.  

**Object to processing** of your personal data where we are relying  on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is  something about your particular situation which makes you want to  object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your  fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object  where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing  purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have  compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which  override your rights and freedoms. 

**Request restriction of processing** of your personal data. This  enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal  data in the following scenarios: 

* If you want us to establish the data’s accuracy.
* Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.
* Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.  
* You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.

**Request the transfer** of your personal data to you or to a third  party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your  personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable  format. Note that this right only applies to automated information  which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used  the information to perform a contract with you.  

**Withdraw consent at any time** where we are relying on consent to  process your personal data. However, this will not affect the  lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your  consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to  provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if  this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
