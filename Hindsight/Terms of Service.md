For the purposes of these Terms “**Confidential Information**” means any and all information disclosed, provided or made accessible by, or on behalf of, one Party (“**Disclosing Party**”) to the other Party (“**Receiving Party**”) and/or any of its key persons, whether in writing, orally or in any other form which is not in the public domain, or regarding past, present, or future marketing and business plans, technical, financial or other proprietary or confidential information of the Disclosing Party, or which, given the nature of the information or material, or the circumstances surrounding the disclosure or provision, reasonably should be understood to be confidential or proprietary, as well as improvements, derivatives, upgrades, updates, and know-how related thereto. Confidential Information does not include information that: (i) is already or becomes generally known or available to the general public through no act or omission by the Receiving Party in breach of these Terms; (ii) is already known to the Receiving Party at the time of disclosure without breaching any confidentiality obligation, as such may be evidenced in the Receiving Party’s written records; (iii) is rightfully disclosed to the Receiving Party by a third party, who is not, to the knowledge of the Receiving Party, in breach of an obligation of confidentiality; (iv) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of, reference to, any of the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, as such may be evidenced in the Receiving Party’s written records; (v) is released and disclosed pursuant to a binding order of a government agency or a court, provided that the Receiving Party (a)  if legally permissible, notifies the Disclosing Party of such release or disclosure with as much notice as reasonably possible so that the other Party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy; and (b) uses reasonable efforts to limit such release or disclosure only to the extent required. Neither Party shall disclose any Confidential Information to any third party; provided, however, that a Party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, agents and/or independent contractors to whom disclosure is reasonably required provided that such individuals and entities have agreed to keep such information confidential in the same or a substantially similar manner as provided for in these Terms. Neither Party will use any Confidential Information except as expressly permitted by, or as required to achieve the purposes of, these Terms. Each Party will take reasonable security precautions to protect and safeguard the Confidential Information against any unauthorized use, disclosure, transfer or publication, with at least the same degree of care and precaution as it uses to protect its own Confidential Information of a similar nature, but in no event with less than reasonable care. Either Party shall notify the other Party upon discovery of any unauthorized use or disclosure of the Confidential Information and shall take reasonable steps to regain possession of the Confidential Information and prevent further unauthorized actions or other breach of these Terms. The Parties agree that in the event of a breach of this Section 6, substantial injury could result to either Party, and money damages may not be a sufficient remedy for such breach. Therefore, in the event that a Party engages in, or threatens to engage in any act which violates any provision of these Terms, the Parties agree that the non-breaching Party shall have no adequate remedy in money or damages and, accordingly, shall be entitled, in addition to all other remedies which may be available to it under law, to seek injunctive relief (including, without limitation, temporary restraining orders, or preliminary or permanent injunctions), and specific enforcement of the terms of these Terms. The non-breaching Party shall not be required to post a bond or other security in connection with the granting of any such relief. The provisions of this Section 6.1 shall survive expiration or other termination of these Terms.

**7.**     **INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS**

 **7.1** │_Hindsight Materials_

All right, title, and interest in and to the Hindsight Materials, including all Intellectual Property Rights therein, are and will remain with Hindsight and, with respect to Third-Party Materials, the applicable third-party providers own all right, title, and interest, including all Intellectual Property Rights, in and to the Third-Party Materials. Client has no right, license, or authorization with respect to any of the Hindsight Materials except as expressly set forth in Section 2.1 of these Terms, or the applicable third-party license, in each case subject to Section 3.1.

8.3 │_Data Security_

The Parties shall exercise commercially reasonably efforts to prevent unauthorized exposure or disclosure of Client Data and Hindsight Materials. Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, the Parties shall maintain, implement, and comply with a written data security program (the **“Data Security Program”**) that requires commercially reasonable policies and procedures to ensure compliance with this Section 8.3 (Data Security).  The Data Security Program’s policies and procedures shall contain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards, including without limitation: (i) guidelines on the proper disposal of Client Data and Hindsight Materials after it is no longer needed to carry out the purposes of the Agreement; (ii) access controls on electronic systems used to maintain, access, or transmit Client Data and Hindsight Materials; (iii) access restrictions at physical locations containing Client Data and Hindsight Materials; (iv) encryption of electronic Client Data and Customer Materials; (v) dual control procedures; (vi) testing and monitoring of electronic systems; and (vii) procedures to detect actual and attempted attacks on or intrusions into the systems containing or accessing Client Data and Hindsight Materials. The Parties shall review their respective Security Programs and all other security precautions regularly, but no less than annually, and update and maintain them to comply with applicable laws, regulations, technology changes, and best practices.

8.4 │_Audits & Testing_

The Parties, or such third party as the Parties may designate, shall perform an annual audit of the Services’ data protection features and to provide a SOC 2 Type II report, upon a written request from a Party.
