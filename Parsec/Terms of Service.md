Your use of Unity’s Parsec product suite is subject to these Additional Terms (the “**Parsec Terms**”), which supplement the [Unity Terms of Service](https://unity3d.com/legal/terms-of-service) (herein, the Parsec Terms and the Unity Terms of Service shall collectively be referred to as the “**Agreement**”). Such Unity Terms of Service shall be incorporated herein by reference as if recited at length and shall govern, unless otherwise specified in these Parsec Terms.

Unity Technologies SF, (together with our affiliates, “**Unity**”, “**we**”, or “**us**”) provides simple, low-latency game streaming through desktop and mobile applications available for download. The [Parsec website](https://parsec.app/) and its subdomains (collectively, the “**Parsec Site**”), the Parsec software and associated documentation that is made available to you by Unity (“**Parsec Software**”), all Parsec mobile applications (collectively, the “**Parsec App**”), and the services and resources available or enabled via the Parsec Site, Parsec Software, or the Parsec App (collectively the “**Parsec Offerings**”) are controlled by Unity.

The Agreement is legally binding and governs your use of the Parsec Offerings, including the Parsec Software and Parsec App. By registering on the Parsec Site or Parsec Application or by visiting, browsing, or using any of the products or services in the Parsec Offerings, in any way, you (“**user**”, “**Your**” or “**you**”) represent and affirm that you have read, understand, and agree to be legally bound by and comply with this Agreement. If you do not agree with this Agreement, you are not authorized to use the Parsec Offerings in any manner.

Any terms not expressly defined in these Parsec Terms shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Unity Terms of Service unless the context dictates otherwise. Any conflict between these Parsec Terms and the Unity Terms of Service shall be resolved in favor of the terms most favorable to Unity.

1. Applicable Privacy Policy

### 2.1.Parsec Account Deletion.

You may delete your Parsec Account at any time, for any reason, from the “Account” page on the Parsec Site.

### 3.5.No Support or Maintenance.

Except for the limited support services offered to Parsec Teams and Enterprise subscribers, you acknowledge and agree that Unity will have no obligation to provide you with any support or maintenance in connection with the Parsec Offerings.

The Parsec Offerings may be made available or accessed in connection with third-party services and content (including advertising) that Unity does not control. You acknowledge that different terms of use and privacy policies may apply to your use of such third-party services and content. Unity does not endorse such third-party services and content and in no event is Unity responsible or liable for any products or services of such third-party providers.

6.Your Content
--------------

### 6.1.Definition and Responsibility.

In addition to the items included in the definition in the Unity Terms of Service, within these Parsec Terms, “**Your Content**” means any information and content that a user submits to, or uses with, the Parsec Offerings (including content streamed through the Parsec Software, content submitted to message boards, content emailed, transmitted, or otherwise made available through equivalent areas of the Parsec Site). You are solely responsible for Your Content, including owning copies of all games that you host via the Parsec Software. You assume all risks associated with use of Your Content, including any reliance on its accuracy, completeness or usefulness by others, or any disclosure of Your Content that personally identifies you or any third party.

### 6.2.Representations.

You hereby represent and warrant that Your Content does not and will not violate Agreement or any policies therein, and that you own or control all necessary intellectual property rights in and to Your Content, including to stream Your Content through the Parsec Software.

### 6.3.Content Restrictions and Responsibility.

In addition to other restrictions and policies imposed by the Agreement, you agree not to use, or permit others to use the Parsec Offerings to collect, upload, transmit, display, stream, or distribute content that violates any third party right, including any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, moral right, privacy right, right of publicity, or any other intellectual property or proprietary right. Unity explicitly reserves the right to terminate your Parsec account upon known or reasonably suspected violation of the foregoing.

Unless otherwise specified with respect to a particular offering by Unity, Unity is not obligated to backup any Your Content, and Your Content, to the extent stored on Unity equipment, may be deleted at any time without prior notice. You are solely responsible for creating and maintaining your own backup copies of Your Content if you desire.

### 6.4.License to Your Content.

To the extent that you provide Your Content to Unity (in connection with, but not limited to, reviews, communications with other members, message boards, etc.), you hereby grant (and represent and warrant that you have the right to grant) to Unity an irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free and fully-paid-up, worldwide license to reproduce, distribute, publicly display and perform, prepare derivative works of, incorporate into other works, and otherwise use and exploit Your Content, and to grant sublicenses of the foregoing rights, in connection with the operation and improvement of the Parsec Offerings. You hereby irrevocably waive (and agree to cause to be waived) any claims and assertions of moral rights or attribution with respect to Your Content. For the sake of clarity, Unity does not, and will not (unless required by law), record user content streamed over the Parsec Software or otherwise use, disclose, or share such streamed content with any third parties, as further outlined in the Parsec Privacy Policy.

### 6.5.No Unity Liability for Your Content.

As further outlined in, and in addition to, Section 8 of the Unity Terms of Service, Unity takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for Your Content or for any loss or damage resulting therefrom, nor is Unity liable for any mistakes, defamation, slander, libel, omissions, falsehoods, obscenity, pornography or profanity you may encounter in Your Content when using the Parsec Offerings. Your use of the Parsec Offerings is at your own risk. In addition, Unity assumes no liability towards third parties’ reasonable expectation that the Parsec Offerings will not contain any content that is prohibited by this Agreement.

### 6.6.Enforcement.

Unity reserves the right (but has no obligation) to investigate and/or take appropriate action against you, in our sole discretion, with respect to Your Content if you violate this Agreement. Such action may include removing or modifying Your Content, terminating your Parsec Account in accordance with Sub-section 2.2 hereinabove, and/or reporting you to law enforcement authorities.

7.Feedback.
-----------

If you provide Unity with any feedback or suggestions regarding the Parsec Offerings or otherwise relating to Unity’s business (“**Feedback**”), you agree that such Feedback shall not constitute your confidential or proprietary information, and hereby assign to Unity all rights in such Feedback. You further agree that Unity will have the right to use and fully exploit such Feedback and related information in any manner it deems appropriate. Finally, you agree that you will not submit to Unity any information or ideas that you consider to be confidential or proprietary.

8.Other Users.
--------------

### 8.1.Access and Security.

Parsec Software allows users to share access to their computers in order to stream content. You are responsible for Your Content that you make available via the Parsec Offerings as set forth in Section 6 of these Parsec Terms, and you are responsible for determining the appropriate access settings to your computer running any of the Parsec Offerings for individuals you invite to access your computer using the Parsec Offerings. THE SOFTWARE COMPRISED IN THE PARSEC OFFERINGS FUNCTIONS BY ALLOWING GUESTS ACCESS TO CERTAIN FUNCTIONS OF THE HOST COMPUTER, SUCH AS THE MOUSE AND KEYBOARD. THE RELEVANT DEFAULT SOFTWARE SETTING RESTRICTS GUEST ACCESS TO ONLY THOSE FUNCTIONS NECESSARY FOR THE PROPER PERFORMANCE OF THE RELEVANT SOFTWARE INCLUDED IN THE PARSEC OFFERINGS. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR DETERMINING THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF ACCESS TO YOUR COMPUTER, AND FOR ANY CONSEQUENCES, INCLUDING LOSS OF DATA, VIRUS OR MALWARE INFECTION, UNAUTHORIZED USE, OR OTHER ACTS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO YOU ALLOW TO ACCESS YOUR COMPUTER THROUGH THE PARSEC OFFERINGS. .

### 8.2.Responsibility.

As further outlined in Section 6 of these Parsec Terms, Parsec does not monitor and is not responsible for Your Content or content that is streamed by you over the Parsec Offerings or any loss or damage that results from its use to share computers. You are solely responsible for Your Content. Unity makes no guarantees regarding the accuracy, currency, suitability, or quality of Your Content or any other content provided by other users. Your interactions with other users are solely between you and such users. You agree that Unity will not be responsible for any loss or damage incurred as the result of any such interactions. If there is a dispute between you and any user, Unity is under no obligation to become involved or otherwise intervene.

9.Term and Termination
----------------------

This Agreement will remain in full force and effect while you use any Parsec Offerings. You hereby acknowledge and agree that the Agreement commenced on the earlier to occur of (a) the date you first used the Parsec Offerings or (b) the date you accepted the Agreement, and will remain in full force and effect while you use any Parsec Offerings, unless earlier terminated in accordance with the Agreement.

Subscriptions for the Parsec Offerings will remain in effect for the subscription period specified in Parsec or Unity’s systems, and thereafter will automatically renew at the then-current list price, unless you or Unity terminate or cancel it, as applicable. For clarity, subscriptions for the Parsec Offerings are not refundable. If you cancel your subscription, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current subscription term; your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires. However, you will not be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then-current subscription period.

In the event of any suspension, disablement or termination, you acknowledge that: (i) Unity will have no further obligation to provide the Parsec Offerings to you; (ii) all rights granted to you under the Agreement will immediately cease; and (iii) you may no longer access any of Your Content that was previously submitted via any of the Parsec Offerings or that was related to your Parsec Account, and Unity will have no obligation to maintain or forward you Your Content. If Unity suspends, disables, or terminates due to your breach of this Agreement, you will also remain liable for any remaining amounts owing for the entire term of your subscriptions. Any suspension, disablement or termination will not affect your obligations to Unity (including, without limitation, proprietary rights and ownership, indemnification and limitation of liability), which by their sense and context are intended to survive such suspension, disablement or termination.

10.Third-Party Services
-----------------------

### 10.1.App Stores.

You acknowledge and agree that the availability of any Parsec mobile application, including the Parsec App, is dependent on the third-party from whom you received the application license, e.g., the Apple App Store or Google Play (“**App Store**”). You acknowledge that this Agreement is between you and Unity and not with the App Store or App Store provider. Unity, not the App Store, is solely responsible for the Parsec Offerings, the content thereof, maintenance, support services, and warranty therefore granted by this Agreement, and for addressing any claims relating thereto (e.g., product liability, legal compliance, or intellectual property infringement). You agree to pay all fees (if any) charged by the App Store in connection with the Parsec Offerings. You agree to comply with and understand that this Agreement is conditioned upon your compliance with, all applicable third-party terms of agreement (e.g., the App Store’s terms and policies) when using the relevant Parsec Offerings. You acknowledge that the App Store (and its subsidiaries) are third-party beneficiaries of the Terms and will have the right to enforce them.

### 10.2.Additional Terms for Apple App Store.

The following applies to any App Store Sourced Application accessed through or downloaded from the Apple App Store:

You acknowledge and agree that (i) Apple has no obligation whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the App Store Sourced Application; (ii) In the event of any failure of the App Store Sourced Application to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price for the App Store Sourced Application to you and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the App Store Sourced Application. As between Unity and Apple, any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be the sole responsibility of Unity, subject to this Agreement.

You and Unity acknowledge that, as between Unity and Apple, Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims you have or any claims of any third party relating to the App Store Sourced Application or your possession and use of the App Store Sourced Application, including, but not limited to: (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the App Store Sourced Application fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.

You and Unity acknowledge that, in the event of any third-party claim that the App Store Sourced Application or your possession and use of that App Store Sourced Application infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights, as between Unity and Apple, Unity, not Apple, will be solely responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and discharge of any such intellectual property infringement claim to the extent required by the Terms.

Without limiting any other terms of this Agreement, you must comply with all applicable third-party terms of agreement when using the App Store Sourced Application

### 10.3.Parsec Payment Processor.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Sub-section 10.3 is in addition to Section 5 of the Unity Terms of Service. With respect to the Parsec Offerings, Unity as well as its affiliate Parsec Cloud Inc., use Stripe, Inc. (and affiliates) as a third-party service provider for payment services (e.g., card acceptance, merchant settlement, and related services). When purchasing a subscription to any of the Parsec Offerings, you agree to be bound by Stripe’s Privacy Policy (currently accessible at [https://stripe.com/privacy](https://stripe.com/privacy)) and its Terms of Service (currently accessible at [https://stripe.com/us/terms](https://stripe.com/us/terms)) and hereby consent and authorize Unity and Stripe to share any information and payment instructions you provide to the minimum extent required to complete your transactions.

11.General.

### 11.2.Export.

The Parsec Offerings may be subject to U.S. export control laws and may be subject to export or import laws and regulations in other countries. You agree to comply fully with all export laws and regulations to ensure that neither the Parsec App or Parsec Software, nor any technical data related thereto, nor any direct product thereof are exported or re-exported directly or indirectly in violation of, or used for any purposes prohibited by, such laws and regulations.

### 11.3.U.S. Governments Rights.

To the extent any of your Enterprise or Teams users are government entities, the following terms apply: the Parsec App and Parsec Software, and associated Documentation are “commercial items” as that term is defined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”) 2.101, consisting of “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation,” respectively, as such terms are used in FAR 12.212 and DFARS 227.7202. If acquired by or on behalf of a civilian agency, the U.S. Government acquires or will acquire the Parsec App and Parsec Software, and/or associated Documentation and other technical data subject to the terms of this Agreement as required in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Computer Software) and 12.211 (Technical Data) of the FAR and its successors. If acquired by or on behalf of any agency within the Department of Defense (“DOD”), the U.S. Government acquires or will acquire the Parsec App and Parsec Software, and/or associated Documentation subject to the terms of this Agreement as specified in 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-3 of the DOD FAR Supplement (“DFARS”) and its successors. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFARS, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software or technical data.

### 11.4.California Residents.

If you are a California resident, you may report complaints regarding Unity or its affiliates to the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Product of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by contacting them in writing at 1625 North Market Blvd., Suite N 112, Sacramento, CA 95834, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210.

### 11.5.Electronic Communications.

You agree that all terms and conditions, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that Parsec provides to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications would satisfy if it were in a hardcopy writing. The foregoing does not affect your statutory rights, including but not limited to the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act at 15 U.S.C. §7001 et seq.

### 11.6.Interpretation.

The section and sub-section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The word “including” means “including without limitation”. The word “may” mean “has the right, but not the obligation, to”. Your relationship to Parsec is that of an independent contractor, and neither party is an agent or partner of the other. These Terms, and your rights and obligations herein, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without Parsec’s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void. Parsec may freely assign these Terms. The terms and conditions set forth in these Terms will be binding upon assignees.

### 11.7.Copyright/Trademark Use.

If you are a subscriber of Parsec “Teams” you grant to Unity the right to use your trade name and/or logo on our website and marketing materials to designate, you as a Unity Parsec customer for the purpose of marketing and promoting the Parsec Offerings.
