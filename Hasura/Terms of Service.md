A user of the Hasura Websites is also referred to as either “User,” “you,” or “your.”

These Website Terms do not apply to your access to and use of the products and/or services which we market on the Websites (our Hasura Services), including our support program for our Hasura Services.

In case of a conflict between these Website Terms and the Applicable Agreements, the Applicable Agreements will take precedence.  
  
Capitalized terms not defined herein have the same meaning as ascribed under the Applicable Agreements.

* ##### Access to the Websites
    
    It is your responsibility to ensure your computer system meets all the necessary technical specifications to enable you to access and use the Websites and is compatible with the Websites. We may, from time to time, restrict access to certain features, parts or content of the Websites to users who have registered with us (such as access to the Hasura Services). You must ensure that any registration details you provide are accurate. If you use or create a log-in ID (such as a username and password or other identifier) as part of our security procedures, you must treat such information as confidential and must not reveal it to anyone else. You are responsible for all activities that occur under your log-in ID and must notify us immediately of any unauthorized use or other security breach of which you become aware. We reserve the right to disable any log-in ID, at any time, if in our opinion you have failed to comply with any of the provisions of these terms of use or if any details you provide for the purposes of registering as a user prove to be false. We cannot guarantee the continuous, uninterrupted or error-free operability of the Websites. There may be times when certain features, parts or content of the Websites, or the entire Websites, become unavailable (whether on a scheduled or unscheduled basis) or are modified, suspended or withdrawn by us, in our sole discretion, without notice to you. You agree that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for any unavailability, modification, suspension or withdrawal of the Websites, or any features, parts or content of the Websites.

You must only use the Websites and anything available from the Websites for lawful purposes (complying with all applicable laws and regulations), in a responsible manner, and not in a way that might damage our name or reputation or that of any of our affiliates. All rights granted to you under these terms of use will terminate immediately in the event that you are in breach of any of them.
