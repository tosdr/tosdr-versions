#### CleverReach

We use CleverReach to send newsletters. The provider is CleverReach GmbH & Co. KG, Schafjückenweg 2, 26180 Rastede, Germany. CleverReach is a service that can be used to organise and analyse the sending of newsletters. The data you enter for the purpose of receiving the newsletter (e.g. email address) is stored on CleverReach’s servers in Germany and Ireland.

Our newsletters sent with CleverReach enable us to analyse the behaviour (conversion tracking) of newsletter recipients. Among other things, we can analyse how many recipients have opened the newsletter message and how often which link in the newsletter was clicked on. The data processing takes place on the basis of your consent (Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) GDPR). You can revoke this consent at any time by unsubscribing from the newsletter. The legality of the data processing operations that have already taken place remains unaffected by the cancellation. If you do not want CleverReach to analyse your data, you must unsubscribe from the newsletter. For this purpose, we provide a corresponding link in every newsletter message or you can also unsubscribe from the newsletter directly on the website. The data you provide us with for the purpose of subscribing to the newsletter will be stored by us until you unsubscribe from the newsletter and deleted from both our servers and CleverReach’s servers after you unsubscribe from the newsletter.
