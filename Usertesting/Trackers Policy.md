Our use of web beacons and analytics services

Some User Testing web pages contain electronic tags known as web beacons that we use to help deliver cookies on our websites, count users who have visited those websites, and deliver co-branded products. We also include web beacons or similar technologies in our electronic communications to determine whether you open and act on them.

In addition to placing web beacons on our own websites, we sometimes work with other companies to place our web beacons on their websites or in their advertisements. It allows us to understand your activity on the website of a User Testing partner in connection with your use of the User Testing Site, Platform and Services.
