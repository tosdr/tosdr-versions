UserTesting Cookie Policy
=========================

Cookies are small text files placed on your device to store data that can be recalled by a web server in the domain that placed the cookie. This data often consists of a string of numbers and letters that uniquely identifies your computer, but it can contain other information as well. Some cookies are placed by third parties acting on our behalf. We use cookies and similar technologies to store and honor your preferences and settings, enable you to sign-in, provide targeted advertising, combat fraud, analyze how our products perform, and fulfill other legitimate purposes described below. User Testing websites and applications also contain web beacons or other similar technologies, as described below.  
 

Our use of cookies and similar technologies
-------------------------------------------

User Testing uses cookies and similar technologies for several purposes, depending on the context or product, including:

* **Storing your preferences and settings.** We use cookies to store your preferences and settings on your device, and to enhance your experiences. Saving your preferences with cookies, such prevents you from having to set your preferences repeatedly. If you opt out of targeted advertising, we store your opt-out preference in a cookie on your device. Similarly, in scenarios where we obtain your consent to place cookies on your device, we store your choice in a cookie.
    
* **Sign-in and authentication.** We use cookies to authenticate you. When you sign into our website using your User Testing account, we store a unique ID number, and the time you signed in, in an encrypted cookie on your device. This cookie allows you to move from page to page within the site without having to sign in again on each page. You can also save your sign-in information so you do not have to sign in each time you return to the site.
    
* **Security.** We use cookies to process information that helps us secure our products, as well as detect fraud and abuse.
    
* **Storing information you provide to a website.** We use cookies to remember some information you shared. When you provide information to User Testing we store the data in a cookie for the purpose of remembering the information.
    
* **Social media.** Some of our websites include social media cookies, including those that enable users who are signed into the social media service to share content via that service.
    
* **Feedback.** User Testing uses cookies to enable you to provide feedback on a website.
    
* **Targeted advertising.** User Testing uses cookies to collect data about your online activity and identify your interests so that we can provide targeted advertising that is most relevant to you.
    
* **Analytics.** We use first- and third-party cookies and other identifiers to gather usage and performance data. For example, we use cookies to count the number of unique visitors to a web page or service and to develop other statistics about the operations of our products.
    
* **Performance.** User Testing uses cookies to understand and improve how our products perform. For example, we use cookies to gather data that helps with load balancing; this helps ensure that our websites remain up and running.
    

In addition to the cookies User Testing sets when you visit our websites, third parties can also set cookies when you visit User Testing sites. Third party cookies are cookies set by someone other than the website owner for purposes such as collecting information on user behavior, demographics, or personalized marketing. When using our website, you may encounter embedded content, such as YouTube videos, or you may be directed to other websites for such activities as surveys or for job applications. These websites and embedded content may use their own cookies. We do not have control over the placement of cookies by other websites, even if you are directed to them from our website.  
 

How to control cookies
----------------------

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but provide controls that allow you to block or delete them. Instructions on how to block and delete them vary based on the browser so please refer to that browser's specific instructions.

Where required, we obtain your consent before placing optional cookies that are not (i) strictly necessary to provide the website or (ii) for the purpose of facilitating a communication. We separate these optional cookies by purpose, such as for advertising and social media purposes. You may consent to certain categories of optional cookies and not others. You also may adjust your choices by clicking the "cookie icon" in the footer of [www.usertesting.com](https://www.usertesting.com/).

Certain features of User Testing's products depend on cookies. Choosing to decline certain cookies may result in decreased functionality on User Testing Site, Platform and Services.  
 

Our use of web beacons and analytics services
---------------------------------------------

Some User Testing web pages contain electronic tags known as web beacons that we use to help deliver cookies on our websites, count users who have visited those websites, and deliver co-branded products. We also include web beacons or similar technologies in our electronic communications to determine whether you open and act on them.

In addition to placing web beacons on our own websites, we sometimes work with other companies to place our web beacons on their websites or in their advertisements. It allows us to understand your activity on the website of a User Testing partner in connection with your use of the User Testing Site, Platform and Services.
