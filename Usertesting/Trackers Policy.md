Our use of cookies and similar technologies

User Testing uses cookies and similar technologies for several purposes, depending on the context or product, including:

* **Storing your preferences and settings.** We use cookies to store your preferences and settings on your device, and to enhance your experiences. Saving your preferences with cookies, such prevents you from having to set your preferences repeatedly.

Similarly, in scenarios where we obtain your consent to place cookies on your device, we store your choice in a cookie.
* **Sign-in and authentication.** We use cookies to authenticate you. When you sign into our website using your User Testing account, we store a unique ID number, and the time you signed in, in an encrypted cookie on your device. This cookie allows you to move from page to page within the site without having to sign in again on each page. You can also save your sign-in information so you do not have to sign in each time you return to the site.
