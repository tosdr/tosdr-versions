UserTesting may offer non-UserTesting products or services (“**Third Party Products**”), or the Services may enable access to Third Party Products, that may require acceptance of third party terms presented to the Customer. Linking to or use of Third Party Products constitutes Customer’s agreement with such terms. UserTesting is not a party to such third-party agreements and is not responsible for such Third Party Products or any exchange of data between Customer and any third party.

15.11.         Independent Contractors. The parties are independent contractors. This Agreement will not be construed to create or imply any partnership, agency, or joint venture. Unless expressly provided in this Agreement, no failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power, or remedy shall operate as a waiver of any such right, power, or remedy.

15.12.         Notices. Notice shall be deemed given upon receipt via an email, or personal delivery, delivery by a nationally recognized overnight delivery service (e.g., FedEx, UPS) or any other valid form of transmission recognised under applicable law.
