14.14 Publicity. Neither party will use the names, likeness, logos, trademarks or other identifying information of the other party without the prior written consent of the other, except that Customer agrees that UserTesting may use Customer’s name,  likeness, logos, trademarks or other identifying information in customer listings and in marketing material.
