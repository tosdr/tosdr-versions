**Please read these Terms and Conditions carefully.**

These General Terms and Conditions (**“Terms”**) combined with all Orders (as defined below) and any other terms incorporated herein by reference, together comprise the entire understanding between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereto (collectively the **“Agreement”**) and  govern Customer’s access and use of UserTesting’s Products and Services, as such terms are defined below. “**UserTesting**” means the UserTesting entity providing Products or Services to the Customer (and thus the entity or entities with all rights and obligations with respect to those Products or Services). “**Customer**” means the client, customer or subscriber agreeing to or accepting these terms.

IF CUSTOMER DOES NOT AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS, CUSTOMER MUST NOT USE  THE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES.

**1.         OVERVIEW.**

UserTesting has developed certain proprietary software applications, including web-based, self-service digital user testing and customer experience measurement solutions (“**Products**”) and services (“**Services**”). These Products and Services enable customers to create, develop, or manage test plans, define audiences, and conduct tests (**“Tests**”) to solicit feedback from individuals for Customer’s internal business use only (**“Purpose**”), and to generate content from Tests, including but not limited to Recordings, derivatives thereof, content generated from Recordings, and reports and information about Tests (“**Output**”).

2.         **CONTRIBUTORS**

   2.1.         Contributors. Certain Products facilitate the participation of individuals (**“Contributors”**) in Tests.

                         (a)         In relation to UserTesting sourced Contributors, Customer agrees that it will not, without UserTesting’s prior written consent: a) solicit contact information or b) contact such Contributors outside of the specific Test for which they were sourced.

 15.3.         Third Party Rights.  Save as to the express rights of any Affiliates under an Order, the parties do not intend to establish any third party rights through the execution of the Agreement. Any such third party rights possible under applicable law, whether by statute or common law, are hereby expressly excluded.

 15.4.         Third Party Products. UserTesting may offer non-UserTesting products or services (“**Third Party Products**”), or the Services may enable access to Third Party Products, that may require acceptance of third party terms presented to the Customer. Linking to or use of Third Party Products constitutes Customer’s agreement with such terms. UserTesting is not a party to such third-party agreements and is not responsible for such Third Party Products or any exchange of data between Customer and any third party. Access to Third Party Products by way of UserTesting may be withdrawn at any time. UserTesting has no responsibility for claims based on Third Party Products or items not provided by UserTesting.

 15.7.         Entire Agreement. The Agreement constitutes the complete and exclusive agreement between Customer and UserTesting with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any prior communications (both written and oral) regarding such subject matter. UserTesting expressly objects to any additional or conflicting terms in any Customer purchase order or other Customer form. Each party represents that it has validly entered into this Agreement and has the legal power to do so. Neither party may vary the terms of this Agreement unless documented in writing signed by an authorized signatory of each party.

 15.8.         Export Compliance. The Products or Services, and UserTesting Property may be subject to export laws and regulations of the United States of America (“**US**”), the United Kingdom (“**UK**”) or the European Union (“**EU**”) and other jurisdictions. Each party represents that it is not named on any US, UK, EU or other applicable denied-party list. Customer is required to determine if any content, data or information uploaded by Customer is subject to US, UK or EU  export control or export control of any other applicable  jurisdiction.  Customer will not and nor will it permit (i) any User or any third party to access or use the Products or Services in a US-embargoed  or otherwise restricted country or region, or (ii) otherwise access or use the Products or Services or upload any content, data or other information in violation of any US, UK, EU or other applicable export law or regulation.

 15.9.         Force Majeure. Neither Customer (except for payment due under the Agreement) nor UserTesting will be liable for delays or non-performance of any of its obligations only to the extent that the delay or failure to perform the obligation in question is caused by any event or circumstance beyond its reasonable control, including acts of God, acts of government, flood, fire, earthquakes, civil unrest, acts of terror, pandemics, strikes or other labor problems or Internet service provider failures or delays.

15.10.         Governing Law. This Agreement, its subject matter and its formation (and any non-contractual disputes or claims) are, regardless of any rules concerning conflict of laws, governed by: (a) the laws of the State of California and the federal laws of the United States of America, if you are located in the continent of North America or South America; (b) English law, if you are located elsewhere in the world. You and we both irrevocably agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of either Section 15.10(a) or Section 15.10(b) herein, as applicable. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is specifically excluded from application to this Agreement.

15.11.         Independent Contractors. The parties are independent contractors. This Agreement will not be construed to create or imply any partnership, agency, or joint venture. Unless expressly provided in this Agreement, no failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power, or remedy shall operate as a waiver of any such right, power, or remedy.

15.12.         Notices. Notice shall be deemed given upon receipt via an email, or personal delivery, delivery by a nationally recognized overnight delivery service (e.g., FedEx, UPS) or any other valid form of transmission recognised under applicable law. Notices to Customer shall be sent to the email or postal address appearing on the applicable Order or an updated notice address delivered in writing (including by email subsequent to an Order taking effect. Notices to UserTesting shall be sent to the postal address on UserTesting’s website or registered place of business and with an e-mail cc to “[legal@usertesting.com](mailto:legal@usertesting.com)”.

15.13.         No Waiver. Failure to enforce a provision in this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of that provision, and a waiver of a provision will be binding only if made in writing by the waiving party.

15.14.         Publicity. Neither party will use the name of the other party in publicity activities without the prior written consent of the other, except that Customer agrees that UserTesting may use Customer’s name in customer listings and in marketing material.

15.15.         Severability. If any provision is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect without being impaired or invalidated.
