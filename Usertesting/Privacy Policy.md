Where we transfer your personal data to third party service providers, we remain liable for ensuring that these third parties process your personal data in accordance with our privacy commitments and applicable data protection laws. We take all necessary steps to ensure that any third party we work with provides the same level of protection for your personal data as required by the DPF principles.

We may also share your personal information: (a) as required by law or legal process; (b) in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements or other requests; (c) to investigate suspected violations of any terms or policies applicable to our products or the services provided by us or our third party providers or affiliates; (d) where we reasonably conclude that it is necessary for defending, exercising or establishing our legal rights; (e) to investigate alleged or actual fraud, misrepresentation or other misconduct; (f) in connection with a prospective sale, merger, change of control, bankruptcy or similar transaction; and (g) to other third parties with your express consent. 

**Third-party websites** 

The website (or the platform) may contain links to other websites or Internet resources. When you click on one of those links, you are contacting another website or Internet resource. We have no responsibility or liability for, or control over, those other websites or resources or their collection, use and disclosure of your information. We suggest that you read the privacy policy and terms of use of each such website.

**Security**

The security of your personal information is important to us. We have adopted appropriate technical and organisational measures and follow industry best practices in order to protect any personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

**How long do we keep your information for?** 

We may only retain your personal information for the purposes set out in this policy and for as long as we have a legal or business requirement to do so. By law, different retention periods apply to different types of records and data, however the longest we will normally hold any personal data is 7 years from the date of your last interaction with us. 

**Exercising your rights**

You have the right to request that we: 

* Provide you with access to your personal information 
* Rectify or correct your personal information
* Erase your personal information
* Restrict processing of your personal information, including refraining from selling it or otherwise providing it to any third parties

You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the appropriate supervisory authority in your country if applicable, if you consider that we are in breach of our obligations under data protection laws. The foregoing rights may be subject to certain limitations pursuant to applicable law. You may request the exercise of these rights by sending an email to [privacy@usertesting.com](mailto:privacy@usertesting.com). Additionally, you may unsubscribe from marketing emails by clicking the ‘unsubscribe’ button in the footer of any of those emails.

We will respond to your request within 30 days, unless a faster response is required by law.

**Sources of Personal Data**

We collect information about you from several sources, which include third party providers or directly from you. Because information from several sources may be combined into one record, it may be difficult or impossible to identify the exact source of one particular piece of information.

To the extent that you provide personal data (e.g. audio or video recording) as part of a test (“**Test**”), we may receive personal data about you from Study Creators. In such case, that Study Creator is your data controller, and UserTesting acts as a data processor. In all cases, such sharing is related to your participation in their Test, such as sharing a video recording of your participation in a Test. Please note, we do not control how Study Creators use and share your information once they receive it. You will need to contact such Study Creator(s) directly for information about their privacy practices or to exercise rights you may have (including if you would like to opt-out of receiving future emails from a Study Creator).

* **Identity Data**. This is information that helps us identify who you are, like your name and email address/userID.
* **Contact Data**. This is information that details how we can contact you, like your email address, telephone number or postal address.
* **Survey Data**. This is any information which you provide as part of a Test, which may include any information recorded in your survey responses, audio and video recordings and/or any information collected during screen recording, including behavioural data. Please note, all survey data is voluntary. You can always choose not to provide Survey Data, however, this may prevent you from participating in Tests if the Study Creator has required this.
* **Observed Data.** This is information about your online browsing behaviour on the Platform, including information about any devices or applications you have used to access our services (including the make, model and operating system, IP address, general location, browser type and mobile device identifiers) or information about how and when you used the Platform.

**Third parties**

We may receive some information from you from Study Creators, as a processor for that Study Creator. In all cases, such sharing is related to your participation in their Test, such as sharing a video recording of your participation in a Test. Please note, we do not control how Study Creators use and share your information once they receive it. You will need to contact such Study Creators directly for information about their privacy practices or to exercise rights you may have (including if you would like to opt-out of receiving future emails from a Study Creator).

Additionally, your data may be shared with Imperium, LLC in order to verify the quality of the data provided to us. You may find more information about their own privacy practices in their [privacy policy](https://www.imperium.com/privacy).

**How do we use your data?**

We may use the data we collect about you for a variety of purposes. European data protection legislation sets out specific “lawful bases” for processing personal data. The below sets out the basis under which we may process different information about you, and explains the purpose of that processing.

|     |     |     |

**Automated Processing** 

Some features within the Platform may automatically process your information or be used to make judgments about you or your experience or to make recommendations to Study Creators based on Observed Data and/or Study Data. Some of these features used artificial intelligence or machine learning. Specifically:

* If you agree to your audio being recorded as part of a Test, Study Creators may request that a written transcript of what you said be generated
* Study Creators may request automated analysis of any such transcript in connection with your other Test results, in order to analyse your comments, reviews or feedback to determine the overall sentiment of your experience during a Test, identify keywords that contributors use most frequently or identify common themes within the results of a Test
* Certain behavioural data such as excessive clicking or scrolling that are identified within your Study Data may be used to categorise moments within the user journey as “friction” in order to help Study Creators identify where you may have had difficulty interacting with websites or prototypes.
