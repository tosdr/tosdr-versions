We will have in place an agreement with each of these processors which will restrict how they are able to process your personal information and require them to keep it secure. We will never sell your personal data.

We may also share your personal information: (a) as required by law or legal process; (b) in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements or other requests; (c) to investigate suspected violations of any terms or policies applicable to our products or the services provided by us or our third party providers or affiliates; (d) where we reasonably conclude that it is necessary for defending, exercising or establishing our legal rights; (e) to investigate alleged or actual fraud, misrepresentation or other misconduct; (f) in connection with a prospective sale, merger, change of control, bankruptcy or similar transaction; and (g) to other third parties with your express consent. 

**Third-party websites** 

The website (or the platform) may contain links to other websites or Internet resources. When you click on one of those links, you are contacting another website or Internet resource. We have no responsibility or liability for, or control over, those other websites or resources or their collection, use and disclosure of your information. We suggest that you read the privacy policy and terms of use of each such website.

**Security**

The security of your personal information is important to us. We have adopted appropriate technical and organisational measures and follow industry best practices in order to protect any personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

**How long do we keep your information for?** 

We may only retain your personal information for the purposes set out in this policy and for as long as we have a legal or business requirement to do so. By law, different retention periods apply to different types of records and data, however the longest we will normally hold any personal data is 7 years from the date of your last interaction with us. 

**Exercising your rights**

You have the right to request that we: 

* Provide you with access to your personal information 
* Rectify or correct your personal information
* Erase your personal information
* Restrict processing of your personal information, including refraining from selling it or otherwise providing it to any third parties

You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the appropriate supervisory authority in your country if applicable, if you consider that we are in breach of our obligations under data protection laws. The foregoing rights may be subject to certain limitations pursuant to applicable law. You may request the exercise of these rights by sending an email to [privacy@usertesting.com](mailto:privacy@usertesting.com). Additionally, you may unsubscribe from marketing emails by clicking the ‘unsubscribe’ button in the footer of any of those emails.

We will respond to your request within 30 days, unless a faster response is required by law.

**Sources of Personal Data**

We collect information about you from several sources, which include third party providers or directly from you. Because information from several sources may be combined into one record, it may be difficult or impossible to identify the exact source of one particular piece of information. 

**Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies**

We and our partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyse trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. 

If you want to restrict or block cookies set by our website, you may change your browser settings to do so. For more information about our cookies and to learn more about the cookies on your device, and opt out of them if you wish, please visit [https://www.usertesting.com/cookie-policy](https://www.usertesting.com/cookie-policy). If you use your browser settings to block all cookies (including strictly necessary cookies) you may not be able to access all or parts of our website. 

**EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield**

We adhere to the principles of the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks, although we do not rely on such frameworks as a legal basis for transfers of personal data in light of the judgment of the Court of Justice of the EU in Case C-311/18. If any personal data is transferred outside of the EEA, we will ensure that any such transfer of personal data is governed by an adequacy decision or an alternative valid mechanism for international data transfers, such as the Standard Contractual Clauses. 

We participate in and have certified our compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework.  We are committed to subjecting all personal data received from European Union (EU) member countries and Switzerland, respectively, in reliance on each Privacy Shield Framework, to the Framework’s applicable Principles.  To learn more about the Privacy Shield Frameworks, and to view our certification, visit the [U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield List](https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/list). 

We are responsible for the processing of personal data we receive, under each Privacy Shield Framework, and subsequently transfer to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf.  We comply with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.

With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Frameworks, we are subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.  In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at [https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request](https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request).

Under certain conditions, [more fully described on the Privacy Shield website](https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint), you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.
