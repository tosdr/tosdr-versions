Version Number: 2.8  
  
Our Cookie Policy in German: [https://wise.com/de/legal/cookie-policy](https://wise.com/de/legal/cookie-policy)  
  

We ("Wise") use small files (known as, **Cookie**, **Cookies**) to see how you use our site and products. We put them on your computer when you visit our site. We use them to know it’s you and store information about your visits. With Cookies we can give you a better browsing experience, make our products better, and keep our marketing costs down. They make it easier to log in, and they show us where you might need help with our products.

Below, we’ve explained how and why we use Cookies, and what each of them do:

* **Strictly Necessary or Essential Cookies** are there for our website to work. They let us save your cookie choice , and keep the site secure. They’re always on.
* **Functional Cookies** give you a better browsing experience. These Cookies let us make the site suit your needs, like showing it in the same language as your web browser.
* **Analytical or Performance Cookies** help us make our products better. These let us use tools that show us how you use our products. They help us find and fix problems for our customers.
* **Cookies that keep our marketing costs down.** These make our marketing better — helping us to spend less on sites like Google and Facebook, and more on charging as little as we can. When our costs go down, so do our prices. We share this information in aggregate form with third parties, for the purpose of advertising.

**How to block Cookies**

You can choose to block all or some Cookies, to do this you should go to your browser settings. However, if you block all Cookies (including essential Cookies) you may not be able to use some of the site. Your browser settings also allow you to delete all Cookies stored on your device any time you wish.

**How to control Cookies**

The UK Information Commissioner’s Office has provided the following guidance on Cookies:

* You can read information on Cookies on different websites, including AboutCookies.org and AllAboutCookies.org.
* The European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance website ‘Your Online Choices’: allows you to install an add-on to decline Cookies across different advertising networks. Google has developed a browser add-on to allow users to decline Google Analytics on all websites which use it. This is also available in the Chrome web store.
* Some browsers include a feature known as ‘Do Not Track’ or DNT. This allows you to choose whether a website can track you. However, whilst DNT is available in many browsers, websites do not need to recognise this request, so it may not always work. You can get help on how to use DNT in Microsoft Edge, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome and Opera.
* For more information on how browsing works, visit the support pages for your browser: Microsoft Edge, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari (IOS mobile and desktop) and Opera.

If you worry about online tracking you can:

* Install a privacy-friendly browser on your device, such as Mozilla Firefox, Firefox Focus or Brave;
* Install anti-tracking and ad-blocking plug-ins on that browser, such as uBlock, Ghostery or PrivacyBadger; and
* Use privacy-friendly web search engines, such as DuckDuckGo or Qwant.

This cookie lets us identify which users have been randomly selected to take part in a sample to monitor those users’ behaviour on our site.  
  
Hotjar also provides us with a heatmap of the site which allows us to monitor, for example, how far you’ve scrolled down a page and where you may have hovered.  
  
With session and screen recording, we’re able to get more context for complicated problems — by observing users going through our flows in an uninterrupted manner, in their real life setting. This helps us identify subconscious thought patterns users have, which helps us pin-point where customers might struggle in our product.  
  
We set the \_hjClosedSurveyInvites cookie once a visitor interacts with a survey invitation modal popup. We use it to ensure that the same invite does not reappear if it has already been shown.  
  
We set the \_hjDonePolls cookie once a visitor completes a poll using the Feedback Poll widget. We use it to ensure that the same poll does not reappear if it has already been filled in.  
  
We set the \_hjMinimizedPolls cookie once a visitor minimises a Feedback Poll widget. We use it to ensure that the widget stays minimised when the visitor navigates through our site.  
  
We set the \_hjDoneTestersWidgets cookie once a visitor submits their information in the Recruit User Testers widget. We use it to ensure that the same form does not reappear if it has already been filled in.  
  
We set the \_hjIncludedInSample cookie to let Hotjar know whether that visitor is included in the sample, which lets us generate funnels.  
  
We set the \_hjShownFeedbackMessage cookie when a visitor minimizes or completes Incoming Feedback. We do this so that the form will be minimised immediately if they navigate to another page where it is set to show.  
  
The \_hjRecordingLastActivity cookie should be found in sessionStorage (as opposed to cookies). This gets updated when a visitor recording starts and when data is sent through the WebSocket (the visitor performs an action that Hotjar records).  
  
We use the hjTLDTest cookie when the Hotjar script executes and we try to determine the most generic cookie path we should use, instead of the page hostname. We do this so that cookies can be shared across subdomains (where applicable). To determine this, we try to store the \_hjTLDTest cookie for different URL substring alternatives until it fails. After this check, the cookie is removed.  
  
We use the \_hjUserAttributesHash cookie as user attributes are sent through the Hotjar Identify API are cached for the duration of the session in order to know when an attribute has changed and needs to be updated.  
  
We set the \_hjIncludedInPageviewSample cookie to determine if a user is included in the data sampling defined by your site's pageview limit.  
  
The \_hjCachedUserAttributes cookie stores User Attributes which are sent through the Hotjar Identify API, whenever the user is not in the sample. These attributes will only be saved if the user interacts with a Hotjar Feedback tool.

Because the data is all hashed, Meta is unable to identify you unless have also created an account with them and agreed to their terms and conditions. The \_fbc cookie used by (the owner of Facebook) to store reference to campaign/advertisement so Meta/Facebook can attribute this website visit to a particular click.  
  
For example, if a user registers on wise.com, we will share with Meta the following hashed information: name, email address, phone number, city, and zip code. If you have an account with a Meta product or service like Facebook, Meta will be able to identify you as the same user that has registered for Wise. If you don’t have an account, the hash is rendered useless, and as such ‘new’ information previously unknown to Facebook is not shared with Facebook. The data cannot be decrypted.  
  
In this example, we can measure the effectiveness of our Meta / Facebook advertising. It helps us understand how many users have registered with Wise via Meta products. This is important as it means we can make informed investment decisions about our advertising. This may help us contribute to our overall mission of reducing prices for customers over time.  
  
This can also help us prevent advertising irrelevant content to users, e.g. advertisements encouraging users to sign up to Wise when they have already done so.Persistent3 monthsMeta (the owner of Facebook)[https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/)**g\_airpr\_recent\_visist**We use the g\_airpr\_recent\_visit cookie to store data about visitors in order to match the unique identifier with visits to digital media outlets so we can understand the effectiveness of our communications.Persistent1 dayOnclusive[https://onclusive.com/legal/gdpr-dataprocessingaddendum/](https://onclusive.com/legal/gdpr-dataprocessingaddendum/)**Google Ads**
