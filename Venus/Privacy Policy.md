Automated Information Collection

We may collect information collected automatically with information we already have about you in order to identify you as a Venus guest, and to improve your experience. If we are able to identify you as a Venus guest we may, for example, link your activity on our website to your activity on one of our mobile applications. This allows us to provide you with a personalized experience regardless of how you interact with us ‚Äì online, mobile, on phone, etc.

In order to provide the best guest experience possible, we also use automated information collection technologies for reporting and analysis purposes. We examine metrics such as how users are shop on our website, on our mobile applications, and on our phone system, the performance of our marketing efforts, and your response to those marketing efforts.

Venus Automated Collection

We and our service providers use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us or third parties that use our services. This information helps us recognize repeat users, customize their website experience, store items in their cart between visits and make our marketing messages more relevant. Examples of this information include but are not limited to pages you visit, ads you click on, type of browser/device/hardware, purchase information, IP based geographic location and search terms. These technologies also enable us to prevent fraud or other harmful activities.

We may also allow third-party companies to place tags on our digital properties. The tags may collect information from cookies placed by other third-party companies. Our Privacy Policy does not cover these third-party companies. Please contact these third party companies directly for more information about their privacy policy and your choices regarding the tags and the information collected by the tags.

Cross-Context and Cross-Device Identification, Advertising, Personalization, and Advertising Attribution

Cross-Context

We may merge data collected from our own websites and mobile apps. Examples of the data collected by us or by third party companies include: cookie IDs, device Advertising IDs; transactions and browsing history; your interaction with our online and mobile advertisements, including advertisements we serve within our emails; information about ads we serve, such as which ad was served, your interactions with the ads, and the URLs where the ads are served from marketing partners such as Google; the email address we have on file for you; any Registry information you have provided us; demographic and other information regarding your likely commercial interests from third parties; and telephone transaction data. This combination of data enables us to see users‚Äô and Guests‚Äô web activity on Venus websites, app activity on Venus apps, and interactions with our online and mobile advertisements, to create a single set of information from all of the various contexts with which we or our partners interact with you, and to understand how well Venus‚Äôs advertisements perform in terms of translating to transactions online, in app, and on Venus‚Äôs phones. It also helps us improve our users‚Äô and Guests‚Äô experience by delivering more personalized advertising, including email advertising, social media advertising, and paid search advertising, and helps us create more personalized online and in-app experiences.

Cross-Device

We may also link your various devices so that content you see on one device can result in relevant advertising on another device. This allows us to deliver more relevant and consistent advertising to you (for example, if you purchase a product on our website using your desktop, we are able to avoid showing you an advertisement on the same product on your tablet. Instead, we may show you an ad on your tablet for complimentary products to the one you just purchased on our website). We also measure the performance of such ads and deliver information on advertising performance to our advertising partners in aggregate form.

The help function of your browser should contain instructions on how to set your computer to accept all cookies, to notify you when a cookie is issued or to not receive cookies at any time. If you set your device to not receive cookies at any time, certain personalized services cannot be provided to you, and accordingly, you may not be able to take full advantage of all of our features.

Third-Party Automated Collection and Interest-Based Advertising

* * *

Venus participates in interest-based advertising (IBA), also known as Online Behavioral Advertising. We use third-party advertising companies to display ads tailored to your individual interests based on how you browse and shop online, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as ad delivery, reporting, attribution, analytics, and market research. Venus adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) self-regulatory principles for IBA. To learn more about IBA or to opt-out of this type of advertising, visit the [Network Advertising Initiative website](https://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1) and the [Digital Advertising Alliance website](https://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN). Options you select are browser- and device-specific.

We allow third-party companies to collect certain information when you visit our websites or use our mobile applications. This information is used to serve ads for Venus products or services when you visit our websites. These companies use non-personally-identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over, hardware/software information, cookie and session ID) and personally identifiable information (e.g., static IP address) during your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you or advertising-related services, such as ad delivery, reporting, attribution, analytics, and market research. These parties typically use a cookie, web beacon or other similar tracking technologies to collect this information.

Our Do Not Track Policy

Some browsers have a ‚Äúdo not track‚Äù feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. At this time, we do not respond to browser ‚Äúdo not track‚Äù signals, but we do provide you the option to opt out of interest-based advertising.

Mobile Location Information

If you use a mobile device, your device may share location information (when you enable location services) with our websites, mobile applications, services, or our service providers. We use this information to improve our services, and provide you more relevant and personalized advertisements, services, and promotions. To manage how you share your device‚Äôs location settings, go to the Choices section of this privacy policy.

User Experience Information

In order to improve guest online and mobile shopping experiences, help with fraud identification, and assist our guest relations representatives in resolving issues guests may experience in completing online purchases, we use tools to monitor certain user experience information; including login information, IP address, data regarding pages visited and ads clicked, specific actions taken on pages visited (e.g. information entered during checkout process), browser and device information.

Social Media

Venus engages with guests on multiple social media platforms (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest). If you contact us on one of our social media platforms, request guest service via social media, or otherwise direct us to communicate with you via social media, we may contact you via direct message or use other social media tools to interact with you. In these instances, your interactions with us are governed by this privacy policy as well as the privacy policy of the social media platform you use.

Social Media Widgets

Our sites and mobile applications include social media features, such as the Facebook Like button, Google Plus, Pinterest, and Twitter widgets. These features may collect information about you such as your IP address and which page you are visiting on our site. They may set a cookie or employ other tracking technologies to accomplish this. Social media features and widgets may be hosted by a third party. Your interactions with those features are governed by the privacy policies of the companies that provide them.

Social Media Ads

We may display Venus ads to you through social media platforms. These ads are sent to groups of people who share traits such as likely commercial interests and demographics. For example, we may have Venus guests who have expressed an interest in shopping for clothing, swimwear, shoes, etc. See the policies of each social media platform for additional information about these types of ads.

Information from Other Sources

We may collect data that is publicly available online. For example, information you submit in a public forum (e.g., a blog, chat room, or social network) may be used to personalize your experience. You are responsible for the information you choose to post online.

We also obtain information provided by third parties. For instance, we obtain demographic and other information from companies that can enhance our existing guest information to improve the accuracy and add to the information we have about our guests (e.g., adding address information).

This improves our ability to contact you and increases the relevance of our marketing by providing better product recommendations or special offers that may interest you.

Exercise of Your Data Rights

* You have the right to request that we disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information. Once we receive and verify your identity, we will disclose to you upon your request:

    * The categories of sources from which the personal information has been collected
    * The specific pieces of personal information we collected about you

* You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and verify your identity, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.
    * We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service providers to:
        * Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our agreement with you.
        * Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.
        * Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.
        * Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law.
        * Comply with any relevant state or federal laws.
        * Enable internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us.
        * Comply with a legal obligation.
        * Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.

To exercise the rights described above, please submit a verifiable request to us by clicking the following [privacy@venus.com](mailto:privacy@venus.com) to contact us by email or mail or telephone using the contact addresses and toll-free telephone number listed above.

Only you or a person whom you authorize to act on your behalf may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. If you wish to authorize another to act on your behalf, please be advised that we may require that you provide the authorized agent with signed written permission to submit a request and verify your own identity and confirm your permission directly with us, unless the authorized agent has a power of attorney. However, you may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.

Our verification process works as follows. Before we may process a request, in order to protect your privacy, we will ask for you to confirm a few pieces of information that we have on our records about you, for example:

* Your address
* Your zip code
* Your email address
* Your phone number
* Your most recent purchase order number

If you make a request online to delete your personal information, we may need to confirm your request before we delete your information.

You may make a verifiable consumer request up to two times within a twelve-month period, without charge. Unfortunately, we cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm that the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.

We try to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension time period (up to 90 days). If you have an account with us, we will deliver our response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our response by mail or electronically, at your option. The response we provide will also explain any reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.

We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your state law privacy rights.

Unless permitted by the state law privacy laws, we will not:

* Deny you goods or services.
* Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
* Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.
* Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
