Privacy Statement for Hosted School Websites
--------------------------------------------

Certain Cengage Group businesses, like Ed2Go, administer websites that provide course materials and services for educational institutions and companies. Information collected on these websites is only used by us to support our clients and provide the services requested by the course instructors. We do not use this information for our own purposes. Most educational institution student course records are also protected by the Family and Educational Rights Privacy Act (FERPA). For information on your company or school's privacy policies, please contact your school’s administration.

Our hosted websites may offer students and professionals the opportunity to interact directly with Cengage Learning. If so, the [Cengage Group Privacy Notice](https://www.cengagegroup.com/privacy/notice/) will apply to that information.
