### Minors

You are not allowed to use the Services if you are under the age of 13. If you are under 18, you must have parental permission to accept these Terms.

### Changes to Services

At any time, Cengage may, with or without notice, add features to the Services, or change or remove features of the Services.

### Computer Hardware, Software and Internet Access Requirements

You must provide, at your own expense, all equipment, software, and internet access needed to use the Services.

### Your Account

To use a Service, you will need a Cengage account with an associated username and password (unless you log in through a “single sign-on” system using your learning management system username and password, in which case this section does not apply to you). Certain Services may require additional login information.

Your account is for your personal use only. You may not authorize others to use your account, and you may not assign or transfer your account to anyone else.

You must keep your username and password confidential. You are responsible for all activities, charges, and liabilities associated with your account. You agree to notify Cengage immediately if you become aware of any unauthorized use of your account. If you are a minor, Cengage reserves the right to provide access to your account to your parent or guardian.

### Cengage Ownership of the Services

Cengage and its licensors own and retain all right, title, and interest in and to the Services, all underlying technology used with or otherwise enabling the Services, and all software and Content other than user-created Content (which users own subject to the license granted to Cengage herein) available within the Services (collectively, “Cengage Materials”), including all associated trademarks, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights. Nothing in these Terms transfers any such rights, title, or interest to you or any other user, and Cengage reserves all rights not expressly granted to you. All trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, and graphics included within the Services ("Marks") are trademarks of Cengage and its licensors.

### Limited License and Restrictions on Use

The Services, including all software, apps and other materials provided to you in connection with any Service are licensed, not sold.

For the duration of your subscription only, Cengage grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to access and to use only the Service(s) to which you have subscribed for personal, educational purposes, subject to your compliance with these Terms. You may not use the Services for any other purpose, or after your subscription expires.

Neither the Services nor any portion thereof may be displayed, performed, copied, downloaded, sold, resold, used, distributed, or otherwise exploited for any commercial purpose. You may not use any Marks without the prior written consent of Cengage. Any unauthorized use by you of the Services, Cengage’s Marks or other intellectual property automatically terminates the license granted by Cengage under these Terms and your right to use the Services.

You agree that any breach of your obligations with respect to Cengage's and its licensors’ proprietary or intellectual property rights will result in irreparable injury to Cengage and its licensors for which money damages are inadequate, and you therefore agree that Cengage and its licensors shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief to address such breach, without the requirement of posting a bond, in addition to any other relief that a court may deem proper.

You may not, and you represent, warrant, and agree that you will not:

1. Remove, conceal, or alter any proprietary rights notices (including copyright and trademark notices) contained within the Cengage Materials.
2. Extract, copy, modify, reverse engineer, decompile, or otherwise attempt to access or use the source code of the software underlying or otherwise used to provide the Services or any part thereof, except to the extent allowed by law notwithstanding this restriction.
3. Use the Services to commit a criminal offense or to encourage conduct that would constitute a criminal offense or give rise to any third-party claim, or otherwise violate any local, state, federal, or international law or regulation, including export control laws and regulations.;
4. Upload, post, or otherwise transmit any unlawful, threatening, libelous, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, pornographic, profane, deceptive, or otherwise objectionable Content;
5. Upload, post, or otherwise transmit through, to or otherwise using the Services any Content that infringes or violates any intellectual property right, publicity right, privacy right, or other right of any third party;
6. Upload, post, or otherwise transmit through, to or otherwise using the Services any Content that contains any malware, viruses, spyware, worms, or other malicious code or files;
7. Disrupt the normal flow of communication in the Services or otherwise act in a manner that negatively affects any other users’ ability to use or benefit from the Services;
8. Interfere with or disrupt the Services or servers or networks connected to the Services, or violate any requirements, procedures, policies, or regulations of networks connected to the Services;
9. Access (or attempt to access) any part of the Services or Content through any automated means (including use of scrapers, scripts, robots, spiders, or web crawlers), or in any way circumvent the navigational structure or presentation of the Services;
10. Use any content, data, or text in any form in the Services to text or data mine, or to develop or train any application, software, code, or data models, such as ChatGPT or other similar tools.
11. Use the Services for any phishing, trolling, or similar activities, or to redirect users to other sites or encourage users to visit other sites; or to harvest or collect email addresses or other contact information of other users of the Services by automated or other means; Impersonate or attempt to impersonate Cengage or a Cengage employee, another user, or any other person or entity, or post any information that misrepresents the identity, characteristics or qualifications of you or any other person, including the use of a pseudonym, or misrepresenting current or previous positions, qualifications or affiliations with a person or entity, past or present;
12. Frame or mirror any part of the Services;
13. Use metatags or code or other devices containing any reference to Cengage or the Services in order to direct any person to any other website or services for any purpose;
14. Use the Services in a manner contrary to the educational purpose of the Services, such as by posting answers to test or assessment questions provided through the Services; or
15. Otherwise use the Services in violation of these Terms.

### User-Created Content

Certain Services may allow you to upload or otherwise add information, text, graphics, photos, audio, video, and/or other materials and content (“Content”). Cengage reserves the right, but has no obligation, to pre-screen, review, flag, filter, modify, refuse, or remove Content from the Services. You represent and warrant that you own or have the right to provide and use all Content that you provide, and that your Content does not infringe any third-party rights, including any intellectual property, publicity, or privacy rights. You shall be fully and solely responsible for any civil or criminal violations attributable to the creation, use, dissemination of storage of your Content.

You hereby grant Cengage and users of the applicable Service a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable, and transferable license to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, prepare derivative works of, perform, and display your Content in connection with the Services and Cengage’s business, including for promoting the Services, in all media now known or hereafter devised, and through any media channels. In the event that perpetual license terms are not allowed by law, the term shall be for the longest period allowed by applicable law. Cengage does not adopt, endorse, or accept responsibility for user Content or any third-party Content. You agree that Cengage will not be liable for any loss or damage resulting from your reliance on user Content or any third-party Content available through the Services.

Except as required by applicable law, Cengage shall not have any obligation to destroy, return or retain your Content. It is your sole responsibility to backup or otherwise maintain copies of your Content, and to export your Content prior to termination of your subscription. The Services are not designed or intended to be used as part of a disaster recovery facility or an emergency data storage facility. Although Cengage takes reasonable precautions to preserve and protect your Content, you shall not rely on the Services as your only storage means. Cengage is not liable for damage to, deletion of, or failure to store your Content.

### Shared Content

Certain Services may contain Content posted by Cengage and other users, including you, in an area of the Service that is designated as a learning space and/or user community and that is presented to users in a modifiable format and in a manner clearly indicating that modification and non-commercial distribution is permitted (“Shared Content”). Subject to your compliance with these Terms and any use restrictions specified in an applicable Order, and during the term of your subscription only, you may: (1) modify and create derivative works of the Shared Content only in conjunction with use of the Services, and (2) copy, distribute, display, perform, and otherwise use those  modifications, derivative works, and Shared Content only in conjunction with the Services.

### Open Source Content

Open Now and WebAssign with Openstax contain Content made available through a Creative Commons license (such as Attribution 4.0 International) or similar “open source” style license (“Open License”), as clearly and expressly specified within those Services (“Open Content”). You will have the rights to use Open Content solely as specified in the associated Open License. Nothing in these Terms shall restrict your rights under any Open License to Open Content provided through the Services.

### Your Modifications to Shared and Open Content

If you make any modifications to or derivative works of Shared Content, or Open Content, then all such modifications and derivative works shall be considered part of your Content and are subject to the warranty, license and other provisions in the Section entitled “User-Created Content” above, as well as all other applicable provisions of these Terms.

### Fees

Some Services and associated Content require payment of a fee. Unless otherwise specified in an Order, all fees are payable in U.S. dollars and are nonrefundable and non- creditable.

Unless another form of payment is specified in the Order, Cengage will bill your credit card, a debit card, or other payment method such as PayPal for all applicable fees in advance of Service delivery. You are also responsible for paying all processing fees (such as PayPal fees) associated with your payment. You shall provide Cengage with accurate and complete billing information, including your name, address, telephone number, and valid payment information, and shall promptly notify Cengage of any changes in that information.

Cengage will disclose the applicable payment options at the time you place your Order. You shall select a payment method to pay Cengage for purchases you make for and/or from the applicable Services. Cengage or Cengage's billing agent may charge your payment method for all amounts due to Cengage without additional notice or consent unless otherwise required by law. Cengage may, in its discretion: (1) post charges to your payment method individually, or (2) aggregate your charges with other purchases you make within the Services and apply those charges to your next billing cycle.

If Cengage does not receive payment from your credit card issuer, upon demand you shall pay all overdue amounts by other means acceptable to Cengage. Cengage may accept other forms of payment, and if Cengage invoices you for Services, you shall pay to Cengage the amount indicated in each invoice by the due date reflected on the invoice.

If you believe that a billing discrepancy has occurred, unless you notify Cengage in writing within 60 days of the date on which that discrepancy first appeared on your credit card account statement or invoice, as applicable, you waive your right to claim that discrepancy.

Service purchases and subscriptions are nonreturnable and cannot be exchanged. Until your Service is terminated, you will continue to accrue charges for which you remain liable, even if you do not use the Service.

If you fail to pay according to these Terms, Cengage may, without prejudice to its other rights and remedies: (1) charge interest on any unpaid amounts on a daily basis from the original due date at the rate of the lesser of 1.5% per month or the maximum amount permissible by law, (2) suspend or terminate your use and/or access to Services, or both. You shall reimburse Cengage for all reasonable expenses Cengage incurs in collecting past due amounts, including wire transfer fees, collection agency fees, reasonable attorney’s fees, and court costs. Cengage may charge a fee for reinstatement of suspended or terminated accounts.

In addition, if you fail to pay according to these Terms, unless otherwise prohibited by applicable law, you consent and agree that Cengage or its designated third party collection agency may contact you by: (1) phone at one or more of your telephone numbers, including your wireless telephone numbers (in which case you might incur wireless telephone charges under your wireless device plan), (2) text messages (in which case you might incur message and data charges under your wireless device plan) or emails, and/or (3) any other method of contact, including pre-recorded and/or artificial voice messages or an automatic dialing device.

Cengage may from time to time offer Service promotions and discounts for which you may be eligible, including promotions available for a limited time. Unless otherwise specifically noted, Service promotional offers and discounts apply to first-time purchasers only. Separate terms and conditions may apply to promotional offers and discounts.

Except for taxes based on Cengage’s net income, if any authority imposes a tax, duty, levy, or fee upon your use of or Orders for any Services, you shall pay that amount as specified in the Order or Cengage’s invoice or supply Cengage with exemption documentation.

### General Practices and Limits on Use of the Services

Cengage may establish general practices and limits applicable to your use of the Services, including the maximum number of days that your Content is retained in connection with the applicable Service, the maximum storage space allotted to you and the maximum number of times or the maximum duration for which you are allowed to access the Service in a given period of time. Cengage may suspend or terminate user accounts for which applicable fees are unpaid, that are inactive for an extended period of time, or in the event of a violation of these Terms, with or without notice. Cengage may establish and change these general practices and limits at any time, with or without notice.

### Third-Party Services

The Services may include services, offers, and promotions, or other technology provided by third parties (“Third-Party Services”). Suppliers of Third-Party Services are intended third-party beneficiaries of these Terms and may enforce these Terms directly against you with respect to their respective Third-Party Services. Alternately, an Order (or activation process) for a Third-Party Service may include or be accompanied by a separate license, notice or other agreement (“Third-Party Agreement”) and may be subject to additional fees charged by the Third-Party Service supplier, in which case that Third-Party Service is provided solely under the terms of that separate Third-Party Agreement. You agree to be bound by such Third-Party Agreements, including without limitation the YouTube Terms of Service, which can be found at [https://www.youtube.com/t/terms](https://www.youtube.com/t/terms). If you do not agree to be bound by a Third-Party Agreement, do not use the Third-Party Service. Cengage is not a party to, and is not liable for breaches of, any Third-Party Agreement.

Cengage assumes no obligation or liability for: (1) the functionality or performance of Third-Party Services, including their content, accuracy, or reliability, or (2) the acts and omissions, including with respect to privacy practices, of the suppliers of Third-Party Services. A Third-Party Agreement might give the applicable third-party supplier rights with respect to your data beyond those allowed by these Terms or Cengage's Privacy Notice. Cengage does not guarantee that a third-party supplier will comply with its agreement with Cengage or its Third-Party Agreement with you, and Cengage is not required to enforce its agreement with a supplier of Third-Party Services.

### Digital Rights Management

Certain Services might contain or be accompanied by digital rights management technology or similar security technology designed to protect digital information against piracy and other misuse. You acknowledge that any such technology is not a defect in the Service. While accessing a Service, your internet-accessible device may be directly connected to an internet site operated by or on behalf of Cengage in order to upgrade that security technology. You hereby consent to the use and automatic upgrading of that security technology. You shall not circumvent, reverse- engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise tamper with the security technology contained in or accompanying any Service.

Placing an Order for a Developer Offering that includes Developer Offering Terms, or activating a Developer Offering for which the activation process includes Developer Offering Terms, will constitute your acknowledgment that you have read and agree to all applicable Developer Offering Terms, including those provided only in the English language. You acknowledge that Cengage is not a party to, and Cengage is not liable for breaches of, any Developer Offering Terms, and that Cengage is an intended third-party beneficiary of, and may enforce directly against you, all such Developer Offering Terms.

When you use a Developer Offering, Cengage may furnish the following information about you to the developer: (1) your role (for example, instructor or student); (2) your institution or organization; (3) your name; (4) your user ID (for example, email address); (5) the ISBN of the Services you ordered and the ISBN of the  corresponding physical textbook; (6) your Course ID (identifying the type of Course in which you are enrolled, for example, Introduction to Chemistry) and course key (an instructor-created identifier used by students to register for that instructor's Course); and (7) your Course’s Snapshot ID (an ID generated by the Service that identifies the specific Course for which the applicable textbook has been adopted, for example, “Professor Smith’s Introduction to Chemistry class at State University”). The Developer Offering Terms between you and the applicable Developer (and not these Terms) governs the use, storage, and transfer by that Developer and its Developer Offering of that information. The Developer Offering Terms might give the Developer rights with respect to your data beyond those allowed by the developer’s agreement with Cengage and beyond those allowed by the Cengage Terms of Service or Cengage’s Privacy Notice. Cengage does not guarantee that each developer will comply with its developer agreement with Cengage or its Developer Offering Terms with you, and Cengage is not required to enforce a developer agreement against a Developer.

A Developer Offering is either a Cengage-Hosted Developer Offering or a Developer-Hosted Developer Offering. Cengage’s only obligations with respect to Developer Offerings are to: (1) obtain and collect payment for your Developer Offering Order, and (2) host and provide you with online access to the functionality of Cengage-Hosted Developer Offerings in the same manner that Cengage hosts and provides you with online access to the functionality of Services developed by Cengage. Cengage is not responsible or liable for: (1) the availability, delivery, functionality, or performance of Developer Offerings, including their content, accuracy, or reliability or (2) the acts and omissions (including privacy practices) of the developers of Developer Offerings.

### Apple Specific Terms

The Terms in this Section and any other terms required by Apple, Inc. (“Apple”) apply if you are using a mobile application (“App”) distributed by Cengage on an Apple iOS device (iPhone, iPod, or iPad). These Terms are between you and Cengage only, and not Apple. Cengage, not Apple, is solely responsible for the App and its content.

You may only use the App on an iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad, or other Apple device that you own or control and as permitted by (i) the App Store Terms and Conditions and (ii) these Terms.

### WebAssign

WebAssign may be used only in conjunction with an educational course offering in which you are enrolled. In WebAssign, course materials, including textbooks, questions, answers, multimedia files, and ebooks, are accessible to students between the start and end dates, set by the instructor, of the courses for which access has been purchased. This restriction applies to single-semester access, multi-semester access, and Lifetime of Edition access. “Lifetime of Edition” access means that the student has access to course materials whenever that student is enrolled in a course within the same institution in which the same edition of such materials is being used).

Student usernames and passwords may be provided by the instructor (or, if the instructor chooses and if available, by self-enrollment functionality). You should change your password before starting to use WebAssign, to prevent unauthorized access to your assignments.

If your WebAssign account has been set up by your instructor or other administrator, your instructor or administrator may be able to access or disable your account. Cengage shall have no liability for any acts or omissions of your instructor or other administrator.

### Cengage Unlimited & Cengage Unlimited eTextbooks

Cengage Unlimited provides you with subscription-based access to Cengage eBooks, courseware, study guides, and other resources on supported devices (collectively “CU Products”). The CU Products are for your personal use only. The CU Products are non-transferable. You may access the CU Products on no more than two devices or sessions at the same time.

### Subscription Terms

You may acquire Cengage Unlimited for a single-semester term, a one-year term, or a two-year term. A single-semester subscription lasts 4 months from the date you register for your subscription, unless your subscription has been purchased by your school, in which case the subscription may be timed to end at the end of your school’s semester or unless Cengage specifies a different length of term (for example, Cengage may in its discretion specify a longer term if you obtain your subscription substantially prior to the beginning of your semester, or in connection with other one-time promotions). A one-year subscription lasts 12 months from the date you start your subscription, and a two-year subscription lasts 24 months from the date you start your subscription.

If you have purchased a single-semester subscription and are enrolled in a multi-semester course assigned over multiple semesters, you may continue to access and use your assigned multi-semester courseware, without an additional fee. However, unless you extend the Cengage Unlimited subscription, the other features of Cengage Unlimited will not be available after the subscription expires. If your Cengage Unlimited subscription expires prior to the completion of your course or semester, you will no longer have access to your CU Products without purchasing an extension to your subscription, or purchasing your course materials separately.

Cengage Unlimited eTextbooks subscriptions are available for 120-day subscription terms. The subscription lasts for 120 days from the date you register, unless Cengage specifies a longer length of time. There is no ‘access for duration of course’ available with Cengage Unlimited eTextbooks. If your subscription to Cengage Unlimited eTextbooks expires prior to the completion of the course, you will no longer have access to your eBooks unless you renew your subscription or purchase the eBook separately.

### Upgrades

If you purchased a standalone Cengage courseware product or Cengage eBook and you wish to upgrade to a Cengage Unlimited subscription for the same semester or term, Cengage will credit you with the amount paid towards the Cengage Unlimited subscription fee. The maximum credit available to you is the amount of the Cengage Unlimited subscription fee; refunds are not provided.

If you want to upgrade from Cengage Unlimited eTextbooks to Cengage Unlimited, or to a longer Cengage Unlimited subscription term, and receive credit for your prior payment, you must do so within the first 14 days of registering for your subscription.

You may make these changes on the My Subscriptions page accessible via your dashboard.

For purposes of payment, upgrades are treated like a return and repurchase, so you will see a refund for the price of the purchased service and charge for the full price of the new service on your statement. You may not exchange Cengage Unlimited to Cengage Unlimited eTextbooks or exchange a longer-term subscription for a shorter one.

### Free Trial, Subsequent Charges Nonrefundable

Cengage may in its discretion offer free trials of the CU Products. You may only take advantage of one free trial every 90 days. You must provide a payment method (such as a credit card, debit card, or PayPal information) when signing up for the free trial. You will not be charged until the end of the free trial, when Cengage will automatically charge you via the payment method you provided upon sign up. If you do not wish to be charged the subscription fee, you must cancel your subscription prior to the end of the free trial. You may cancel your subscription from the My Subscriptions page accessible via your dashboard.

You will not be charged prior to the completion of the free trial, but your account may reflect an authorization hold. This is because your financial institution places a temporary authorization on your account to ensure funds will be available when the free trial ends. This pending charge is an initial hold that temporarily lowers your available balance. Your account is not actually billed until the expiration of the free trial, so if you cancel your subscription prior to the completion of the free trial, the hold will automatically expire in accordance to the timeframe set by your financial institution.

Not all offers, promotions, or services may be available during the free trial. All fees paid for CU Products are nonrefundable.

### eBooks

As part of your Cengage Unlimited subscription, you will have online access to Cengage’s library of digital eBooks. eBooks are provided in multiple electronic formats. Certain formats may not be fully viewable on your device.

### Courseware

As part of your subscription to Cengage Unlimited, you will have access to your Cengage courseware (such as MindTap, WebAssign, and OWLv2). Access to courseware is limited to those educational course offerings in which you have been enrolled through your institution, and for which you have received a valid course key from your instructor.

### Unincluded Materials

Certain courses may require items (such as consumable workbooks, software, third party materials, or other materials) that are not amenable to digitizing into an eBook or courseware. Your instructor may require you to purchase such items, and they are not included as part of the Cengage Unlimited subscription. Cengage makes no guarantee that the materials you may need for the completion of your course are included in the CU Products.

### Updates

Cengage courseware, eBooks, study guides, third-party products and other resources included in the CU Products may be removed, added, replaced and updated from time to time by Cengage in its discretion, without notice to you. For example, in some cases old editions of an eBook will not be available or will be removed.

### Ancillary Products

eBooks and courseware in Cengage’s library may not include ancillary products and materials included in or bundled with a corresponding printed textbook (such as access to software, workbooks, study guides, supplemental questions, etc. included with the printed textbook).

### CU Free Print Rentals

Cengage Unlimited subscribers may be eligible to take advantage of up to 4 free print rentals per subscription term, but not more than 4 per 12-month period. For example, if you purchase a one semester subscription to Cengage Unlimited you may opt for 4 print rentals during that subscription. If you renew for another one semester term, you will not be eligible for additional free print rentals. You may always purchase additional print rentals. Print rentals are subject to the

If you return a free print rental, you will not be refunded shipping and handling fees and you will not be credited for another free rental.

You will be responsible for the shipping and handling fees for each rental. The current shipping and handling fees are specified in your dashboard and at [https://cengage.force.com/s/article/Cengage-com-What-are-Cengage-s-shipping-charges-and-methods](https://cengage.force.com/s/article/Cengage-com-What-are-Cengage-s-shipping-charges-and-methods).

Rental of print textbooks is not available in all countries.

For more information about Cengage’s Print Rental Service, please review the Print Textbook Rental Terms.

### Career Services

Cengage may in its discretion provide Services that help you identify an appropriate career and/or assist you in finding a job (“Career Services”), for informational purposes only. Cengage does not act as a job placement agency or staffing firm and does not provide professional career counseling services. It is your responsibility to perform and manage your own job search. The terms above regarding Third-Party Services apply to Career Services provided through a third party.

Cengage does not promise or guarantee that any Career Services will be successful or that you will find job interviews or a job through any Career Services. Cengage has no control over any job listings or any organization that offers or fails to offer you a job, and Cengage is not responsible for such job listings, job offers, or the acts or omissions or any such organization. You are solely responsible for confirming the validity of any job offer or potential employer.

Your resume and other applicable information may be shared with interested parties as part of Career Services. You are responsible for ensuring that the information you provide is complete and accurate, and only contains information that you want to share.

### Scope and Applicability

Thank you for using Cengage higher education print products and Services and related apps and technologies. The term “Services” refers to the higher education services, websites, content, databases, software, technologies, and tools delivered by Cengage that link or otherwise refer to these Terms, or that are delivered through a website or service that links or refers to these Terms, specifically including: Cengage Unlimited, MindTap, WebAssign, CNOW, OWLv2 and SAM.

**Cengage is willing to provide print products and Services to you only on the condition that you first accept these Terms by scrolling through the terms and clicking the acceptance button. Please read these Terms carefully and, if you wish, print or save a copy for your records. If you do not accept these Terms, you may not use the Services. If you acquire additional Services in the future, your use of those Services shall also be subject to the then current version of these Terms.**

Your use of certain Services is subject to the Supplemental Terms identified at the end of these Terms. In the event of any conflict between these Terms and any Supplemental Terms, the Supplemental Terms will control with respect to the applicable Service.

### Changes to the Services

At any time, Cengage may, with or without notice, add features to the Services, or change or remove features of the Services.

### Computer Hardware, Software and Internet Access Requirements

You must provide, at your institution’s or your own expense, all equipment, software, and internet access needed to use the Services.

### Your Account

To use a Service, you will need a Cengage account with an associated username and password (unless you log in through a “single sign-on” system using your learning management system username and password, in which case this section does not apply to you). Certain Services may require additional login information.

Your account is for your personal use only. You may not authorize others to use your account, and you may not assign or transfer your account to anyone else.

You must keep your username and password confidential. You are responsible for all activities, and liabilities associated with your account. You agree to notify Cengage immediately if you become aware of any unauthorized use of your account.

### Cengage Ownership of the Services

Cengage and its licensors own and retain all right, title, and interest in and to the Services, all underlying technology used with or otherwise enabling the Services, and all software and Content other than user-created Content (which users own subject to the license granted to Cengage herein) available within the Services (collectively, “Cengage Materials”), including all associated trademarks, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights. Nothing in these Terms transfers any such rights, title, or interest to you or any other user, and Cengage reserves all rights not expressly granted to you. All trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos, and graphics included within the Services ("Marks") are trademarks of Cengage and its licensors.

### Limited License, Permissions and Restrictions on Use

The Services, including all software, apps and other materials provided to you in connection with any Service are licensed, not gifted or sold.

For so long as you serve as faculty at a higher education provider only, Cengage grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to access and to use only the Service(s) to which you have subscribed for purposes of educational instruction, subject to your compliance with these Terms. You may not use the Services for any other purpose, or after your higher education employment ends.

Faculty outside Australia and New Zealand may incorporate Cengage Materials (including your modifications and derivative works of Modifiable Cengage Content (defined below)) through a password protected website or school-approved learning management system accessible solely by your students in: (1) in-class handouts provided without charge and limited in the number of copies, (2) online classrooms or courses so long as access to the Cengage Content is limited to matriculated students enrolled in your class who are required to accept Cengage Terms of Service and enter a unique passcode or other verifiable industry-standard authentication system that ensures each user is individually identified before such access, (3) in-class displays (e.g., via projector, computer monitor or television screen), (4) class outlines or lessons, and (5) non-fee-based exams, in each case associated with a course of study (i.e., a class) for which the Cengage Content included in the Service has been adopted and is concurrently being used. Unless otherwise authorized, all copy and download functionality must be disabled. You may not sell, license, auction, or otherwise redistribute the Product in any form. We ask that you take reasonable steps to protect the Product from unauthorized use, reproduction, or distribution.

Please see below for restrictions applicable to Australia and New Zealand.

Neither the Services nor any portion thereof may be displayed, performed, copied, downloaded, sold, resold, used, distributed, or otherwise exploited for any commercial purpose or other than as permitted above. The Services may not be reproduced or distributed, except that portions may be provided to your students in connection with your educational instruction in your classroom or posted electronically through a password-protected website or school-approved learning management system accessible solely by your students. Unless otherwise authorized, all copy and download functionality must be disabled.

You may not use any Marks without the prior written consent of Cengage. Any unauthorized use by you of the Services, Cengage’s Marks or other intellectual property automatically terminates the license granted by Cengage under these Terms and your right to use the Services.

You agree that any breach of your obligations with respect to Cengage's and its licensors’ proprietary or intellectual property rights will result in irreparable injury to Cengage and its licensors for which money damages are inadequate, and you therefore agree that Cengage and its licensors shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief to address such breach, without the requirement of posting a bond, in addition to any other relief that a court may deem proper.

You may not, and you represent, warrant, and agree that you will not:

1. Remove, conceal, or alter any proprietary rights notices (including copyright and trademark notices) contained within the Cengage Materials.
2. Extract, copy, modify, reverse engineer, decompile, or otherwise attempt to access or use the source code of the software underlying or otherwise used to provide the Services or any part thereof, except to the extent allowed by law notwithstanding this restriction.

4. Upload, post, or otherwise transmit any unlawful, threatening, libelous, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, pornographic, profane, deceptive, or otherwise objectionable Content;
5. Upload, post, or otherwise transmit through, to or otherwise using the Services any Content that infringes or violates any intellectual property right, publicity right, privacy right, or other right of any third party;
6. Upload, post, or otherwise transmit through, to or otherwise using the Services any Content that contains any malware, viruses, spyware, worms, or other malicious code or files;
7. Disrupt the normal flow of communication in the Services or otherwise act in a manner that negatively affects any other users’ ability to use or benefit from the Services;
8. Interfere with or disrupt the Services or servers or networks connected to the Services, or violate any requirements, procedures, policies, or regulations of networks connected to the Services;
9. Access (or attempt to access) any part of the Services or Content through any automated means (including use of scrapers, scripts, robots, spiders, or web crawlers), or in any way circumvent the navigational structure or presentation of the Services;
10. Use the Services for any phishing, trolling, or similar activities, or to redirect users to other sites or encourage users to visit other sites; or to harvest or collect email addresses or other contact information of other users of the Services by automated or other means; Impersonate or attempt to impersonate Cengage or a Cengage employee, another user, or any other person or entity, or post any information that misrepresents the identity, characteristics or qualifications of you or any other person, including the use of a pseudonym, or misrepresenting current or previous positions, qualifications or affiliations with a person or entity, past or present;
11. Frame or mirror any part of the Services;
12. Use metatags or code or other devices containing any reference to Cengage or the Services in order to direct any person to any other website or services for any purpose;
13. Use the Services in a manner contrary to the educational purpose of the Services, such as by posting answers to test or assessment questions provided through the Services; or
14. Otherwise use the Services in violation of these Terms.

In Australia and New Zealand, the extent of faculty permissible copying, reproduction or display of Cengage Content and Modifiable Cengage Content is governed by copyright law and your institution, or representative body, agreement with Copyright Agency Limited in Australia (“CAL”) or Copyright Licensing New Zealand (“CLNZ”), for which an annual fee per student is paid. Permission for use beyond that permitted by your agreement with CAL or CLNZ must be sought directly from Cengage at [https://www.cengage.com.au/permissions](https://www.cengage.com.au/permissions). For clarity, personal use by faculty and students within the designated Cengage platform is granted within these Terms of Use and free of obligations under agreements with CAL and CLNZ, however, any copying, reproduction or display of Cengage Content outside of the designated Cengage platform (e.g., producing in-class handouts for students) is subject to your agreement(s) with CAL and/or CLNZ.

### User-Created Content

Certain Services may allow you to upload or otherwise add information, text, graphics, photos, audio, video, and/or other materials and content (“Content”). Cengage reserves the right, but has no obligation, to pre-screen, review, flag, filter, modify, refuse, or remove Content from the Services. You represent and warrant that you own or have the right to provide and use all Content that you provide, and that your Content does not infringe any third-party rights, including any intellectual property, publicity, or privacy rights. You shall be fully and solely responsible for any civil or criminal violations attributable to the creation, use, dissemination of storage of your Content.

You hereby grant Cengage and users of the applicable Service a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable, and transferable license to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, prepare derivative works of, perform, and display your Content in connection with the Services and Cengage’s business, including for promoting the Services, in all media now known or hereafter devised, and through any media channels. In the event that perpetual license terms are not allowed by law, the term shall be for the longest period allowed by applicable law. Cengage does not adopt, endorse, or accept responsibility for user Content or any third-party Content. You agree that Cengage will not be liable for any loss or damage resulting from your reliance on user Content or any third-party Content available through the Services.

Except as required by applicable law, Cengage shall not have any obligation to destroy, return or retain your Content.

### Supplemental Terms

### MindTap

### Special Provisions Applicable to Developer Offerings

Cengage collaborates with developers to offer them the use of the MindTap Service to develop services and/or content designed to enhance your experience with the Service (“Developer Offerings”). Developer Offerings are not provided under these Terms, but are instead provided under separate terms that are included or accompany the Order (or the activation process) for a given Developer Offering (“Developer Offering Terms”). Placing an Order for a Developer Offering that includes Developer Offering Terms, or activating a Developer Offering for which the activation process includes Developer Offering Terms, will constitute your acknowledgment that you have read and agree to all applicable Developer Offering Terms, including those provided only in the English language. You acknowledge that Cengage is not a party to, and Cengage is not liable for breaches of, any Developer Offering Terms, and that Cengage is an intended third-party beneficiary of, and may enforce directly against you, all such Developer Offering Terms.

When you use a Developer Offering, Cengage may furnish the following information about you to the developer: (1) your role (for example, faculty or student); (2) your institution or organization; (3) your name; (4) your user ID (for example, email address); (5) the ISBN of the Services you ordered and the ISBN of the  corresponding physical textbook; (6) your Course ID (identifying the type of Course in which you are enrolled, for example, Introduction to Chemistry) and course key (a faculty-created identifier used by students to register for that particular Course); and (7) your Course’s Snapshot ID (an ID generated by the Service that identifies the specific Course for which the applicable textbook has been adopted, for example, “Professor Smith’s Introduction to Chemistry class at State University”). The Developer Offering Terms between you and the applicable Developer (and not these Terms) governs the use, storage, and transfer by that Developer and its Developer Offering of that information. The Developer Offering Terms might give the Developer rights with respect to your data beyond those allowed by the developer’s agreement with Cengage and beyond those allowed by the Cengage Terms of Service or Cengage’s Privacy Notice. Cengage does not guarantee that each developer will comply with its developer agreement with Cengage or its Developer Offering Terms with you, and Cengage is not required to enforce a developer agreement against a Developer.

A Developer Offering is either a Cengage-Hosted Developer Offering or a Developer-Hosted Developer Offering. Cengage’s only obligations with respect to Developer Offerings are to: (1) obtain and collect payment for your Developer Offering Order, and (2) host and provide you with online access to the functionality of Cengage-Hosted Developer Offerings in the same manner that Cengage hosts and provides you with online access to the functionality of Services developed by Cengage. Cengage is not responsible or liable for: (1) the availability, delivery, functionality, or performance of Developer Offerings, including their content, accuracy, or reliability or (2) the acts and omissions (including privacy practices) of the developers of Developer Offerings.

* If your rented textbook is returned damaged beyond reasonable wear and tear (for example, cover ripped off, pages torn out, excessive water damage), Cengage may charge you a damage fee equal to the difference between the textbook's then current list price and the total sum of rental fees (including rental extension fees and late fees) already paid by you. "List price" means the list price of the textbook advertised on the Service at the time the damage fee is assessed.
    
* Returned textbooks must be packed appropriately (for example, bubble wrapped) to keep them from being damaged during shipping. If your rented textbook is damaged, you will be liable for such damage, and the textbook will remain the property of Cengage Learning.
