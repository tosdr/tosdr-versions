Terms of Service. Network
=========================

**By visiting this site, depositing funds, creating an ad unit, advertising or interacting in any way with AADS.com you accept and agree with these terms of service.**

Limitation of Liability
-----------------------

AADS offers no guarantees and shall not be liable for any losses incurred or claimed to have been incurred by anyone using AADS, including but not limited to any loss of profits, loss of opportunities, loss of sales or business, loss of agreements or contracts, loss of anticipated savings, loss of or damage of goodwill, loss of use or corruption of software, data, or information or any direct or consequential loss.

Refunds
-------

Any refunds are at the entire discretion of AADS. No refunds are possible once funds have been paid to Publishers. Idle accounts, including the remaining balances, shall be automatically deleted after 6 months of inactivity. By using AADS you agree to waive any rights to claim these funds.

Users
-----

AADS is a platform that provides a matching service for Advertisers seeking to promote goods or services via advertisements (‘adverts) with Publishers seeking to display the adverts on their websites for a fee. AADS users are identified as Publishers and Advertisers and these are both third parties to AADS. A single user may be a Publisher and an Advertiser.

Advertisers are users who use AADS matching service to find Publishers through which they can promote goods, services and websites via online adverts. Advertisers accept full responsibility, including full legal and financial responsibility, for the content of the advert, any message, text, goods, services and any graphical representations they provide and Advertisers hereby agree that their adverts shall not promote anything illegal, harmful, or malicious.

Publishers are users who use AADS matching service to earn revenues from their websites traffic by displaying adverts. Publishers accept full responsibility, including full legal and financial responsibility, for the content of their sites, including the adverts they allow to be displayed. Publishers agree not to display the adverts on pages that contain any copyright-infringing, illegal or malicious content. AADS reserves the right to delete ad units and lock the accounts of any publisher breaching these terms at any time.

Moderation
----------

AADS reserves the right to reject any adverts it may choose. These are usually, but not always, adverts AADS may consider illegal or harmful or in breach of these terms and conditions. Adverts with sensitive or questionable content shall be marked as such, at the discretion of AADS.

Adverts may be banned at any time, and the remaining funds in the account may be refunded to the advertiser after deduction of any costs incurred by AADS. You hereby agree to waive any right to make any claim challenging AADS moderation of your advert.

Support
-------

AADS support can be contacted via an on-site widget or an email address: [\[email protected\]](https://a-ads.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). Please concisely describe the issue and a way to identify you as an Advertiser or Publisher. The response time is not guaranteed and depends on the support team schedule, amount of requests, complexity of the issue and other factors.

AADS support will not respond to any queries coming from parties who are not users of the AADS service.

AADS reserves the right to silently block users who create multiple conversations per a single issue, use all-caps, obscene lexics, or threats in their requests.

Fraud
-----

Accounts suspected of violating these terms and conditions or any fraudulent activity (including but not limited to malvertising, promotion of scams, content hijacking, attempts to circumvent our moderation, generating fake traffic) shall be archived or locked.

To recover an archived or locked account, the legitimate creator of the account shall provide verifiable information about one's identity and will be charged a 10% administrative fee for the additional work caused by the account recovery process. If the account creator fails to provide the requested information within six months, AADS will delete the account and the account balance will not be returned to the account creator.

If a single user is suspected to create multiple accounts to circumvent or violate the AADS terms and conditions, AADS reserves the right to delete the accounts and any funds may not be recovered or a recovery fee of 50% or higher, to the discretion of AADS, may be applied. AADS will not allow accounts suspected to have used AADS to advertise scams or any other fraudulent activity to recover their funds.

Minimum Deposit
---------------

AADS enforces a strict minimum deposit for all advertisers. The minimum deposit value is displayed when the advertiser initiates the deposit process. The minimum deposit value is subject to change so advertisers need to watch for this value at each deposit. Any deposit made below the minimum deposit value will be used to cover fees incurred by AADS and will not be credited to the advertisers account nor returned to the advertiser.

Fees
----

Twenty percent of all monies paid for the advertising service, but not less than ten percent of the deposited funds, shall be retained by AADS as fees.

These fees do not include an additional three percent conversion fee for any accepted deposits other than those paid in Bitcoin and an additional 0.5% fee (one percent for ERC20 and BEP20 tokens) to be paid to the third party crypto payments provider.

Recovery of funds lost due to incorrect deposits (e. g. made via unsupported tokens, addresses, blockchains, or transaction types) is not always possible and may be charged an eight percent fee.

Privacy
-------

User data and statistics are considered public (see [Privacy Policy](https://a-ads.com/privacy_policy)).

Changes
-------

These Terms of Service and all statements on the site may be modified at any time without prior notice. It is the sole and entire responsibility of the user to stay informed of the terms of service at all times.

Terms of Service. Marketplace
=============================

These Terms of Use ("the Terms") constitute a legally binding contract between you, as a visitor or registered user ("user", "you", "your"), and Alpha Communication Services Limited, registered under the laws of Room 1404, 14/F, Blissful Building, 243-247 Des Voeux Road Central, Sheung Wan, Hong Kong ("we", "AADS", "us"), the owner of the website [https://aads.com](https://aads.com/) ("the Website").

The Terms govern your rights and duties regarding the use of the Website and the services we provide through the Website, as well as the relationships between the users. The users and we are collectively referred to as the Parties and individually as a Party.

By merely accessing our Website, you agree to be bound by the Terms.

If you do not agree to be bound, please do not use the Website.

If you want to understand how we process your personal data, please see our Privacy Policy.

Services
========

General Provisions
------------------

The Website is an online marketplace providing features and functionalities that help arrange direct advertisements between users from around the world ("the Services").

Direct advertisement is performed in the form of press releases, PR posts, articles, video advertising, social media advertising ("the Ad"), etc.

Our Services include user registration, content publishing, deal-making and closing, communication, guarantees, user support, notifications, reviews, and other information services available on the Website.

The term \\'Advertisers\\' refers to users who order the production and/or distribution of the Ads.

The term \\'Publishers\\' refers to users who offer to produce and/or place the Ads on their websites or other online resources, including but not limited to blogs, Instagram accounts, Facebook accounts, Telegram channels, and YouTube channels ("the Online Resource").

We reserve the right to add any new functionalities to the Services on the Website at any time. If newly developed functionalities of the Website are not specifically governed by the Terms, they are provided on an "as is" basis and are subject to the Terms to the extent reasonably practicable.

Making and Closing a Deal
=========================

Publishers’ Offers
------------------

Each Publisher may submit multiple public offers to produce and place an Ad on certain Online Resources owned by that Publisher (“the Offer”).

In order to make the Offer available on the Website for other users and to receive responses from Advertisers, we will examine your Online Resource for compliance with our requirements, and at our sole discretion, will decide whether to approve or reject the placement of your Offer.

The Online Resource must have at least 5,000 unique visits per month, including the month preceding the one in which the Publisher submitted the Offer to the Website. We may approve your Offer at our sole discretion if the number of visits is less than 5,000 and we believe that this Online Resource will bring benefits to all Parties.

We will not approve an Offer and will deactivate an already approved Offer if we consider that the content of the Online Resource violates the law, infringes on someone’s rights, or contradicts standards of morality.

AADS is not responsible for the content submitted by advertisers and posted by a Publisher.

The Publisher should approve or reject the Advertiser’s response to the Offer within 5 business days.

At the end of the response period, if no response has been received, the transaction is closed. If the Publisher has not contacted us within 7 days, we have the right to transfer all of the Publisher’s offers to the archive.

The cost of the Offer (including the AADS commission, which is 20%) must be equal to or lower than the cost of the same offer from the Publisher on any of the Publisher's open sources, including, but not limited to, the Publisher’s website and social networks, as well as on other marketplaces where the same offer is listed.

Upon the Negotiation, we ensure the debiting funds on the Advertiser’s Balance for payment security purpose (as prepayment and/or for the secure payment for the services). Be sure that your Balance is enough for the deal or deposit funds for the cost of the order. In the event of total or partial non-fulfillment of the order, the funds will be returned in whole or in part in accordance with the rules described in the Publisher Revenue Payment.

Ad Provision
------------

Upon negotiation, the Publisher must place the Ad according to the terms of the Offer and the Advertiser’s requirements. In case of uncertainty, the Publisher should clarify the issues with the AADS support team and should not act at their sole discretion if the uncertainty relates to the rights and interests of the Advertiser.

The Advertiser is responsible for providing the publication date and materials for publication through the User support service within five days after responding to the Publisher's offer. If the materials and the date are not provided within five days, the order will be moved to Rejected status.

The Publisher is required to approve or provide corrections to the publication date and materials within two days after they are submitted through the User support service. If the Publisher does not respond within five days, the order will be moved to Rejected status.

After the materials are approved, funds equal to the cost of the order will be debited from the Advertiser's balance. If there are insufficient funds, the Advertiser must replenish the balance by the required amount within three days. If the balance is not replenished within this period, the order will be moved to Rejected status.

After the funds are debited from the Advertiser's balance, the Publisher must place the publication on the agreed date, provide a link to the publication, and not delete it within the period stipulated by the terms of the order.

An order is considered published only after the Publisher provides a link to the published material. The Publisher must provide a link to the publication immediately after fulfilling the order and not remove it until the order is completed. Failure to do so may result in the Publisher not receiving full or partial remuneration.

In the event that the order duration is indicated as Lifetime, AADS is not responsible for the removal or alteration of the material one month after its publication.

Publisher Revenue Payment
-------------------------

Payment to the Publisher for a completed order is made in full one day after the link to the published order is provided if the order duration was set to 24 hours. If the order was published but deleted before the completion date, the funds are not debited from the Advertiser's balance, and the Publisher is not paid for the order.

If the order duration is set to one week, the cost is divided into two parts. The first part is paid proportionally on a daily basis during the week. The remaining 50% is transferred a week after the order is fully completed. If the order was published but deleted before the completion date, the funds already paid are not returned to the Advertiser, and the Publisher does not receive the remaining balance.

If the order duration is set to one month, the cost is divided into two parts. The first part is paid pro-rata daily throughout the month. The remaining 50% is transferred a month after the order is fully completed. If the order was published but deleted before the completion date, the funds already paid are not returned to the Advertiser, and the Publisher does not receive the remaining balance.

If the order duration is set to Lifetime, Publisher payouts occur in the same manner as with a 1-month order duration and are paid in full one month after the order is completed.

User Support and Arbitration
----------------------------

Users are provided with support for any issues that may arise from using the Website or the Services ("User Support"). You may contact us through the contact page, email at [\[email protected\]](https://a-ads.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection), or live chat, which is available 24/7. All approvals of materials and communication between the Publisher and the Advertiser take place through AADS User Support.

Our Fee
-------

We do not charge fees for withdrawing funds from our users' wallets. We charge a 20% commission on the order value, so the Publisher receives 80% of the offer price set by them. We reserve the right to change the fee rate at any time.
