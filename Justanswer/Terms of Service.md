These Terms of Use (“Terms”) are a binding legal agreement between you and JustAnswer LLC. (“JustAnswer,” “we,” “us,” or “our”). “User,” “you” and “your” refer to the individual or entity that uses the websites, applications, and other offerings from JustAnswer (collectively, the “Platform”). “Customer” refers to the person who asks a question on the Platform. “Expert” refers to the person who answers a question on the Platform. Customer and Expert together are “Users”. Except in your capacity as an Expert or in an application to act as an Expert, which shall be governed by the Expert Agreement, these Terms govern your use of the Platform.

By using or otherwise accessing the Platform or clicking to accept or agree to these Terms, you (1) accept and agree these Terms and (2) consent to the collection, use, disclosure and other handling of information as described in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.justanswer.com/info/privacy-security), and (3) agree to comply with all rules, policies, and disclaimers posted on the Platform or about which you are notified.

All references to “you” or “your,” as applicable, mean the person who accesses, uses, and/or participates in the Platform in any manner, and each of your heirs, assigns, and successors. If you use the Platform on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that entity, your acceptance of the Terms will be deemed an acceptance by that entity, and “you” and “your” herein shall refer to that entity, its directors, officers, employees, and agents.

**2\. The Platform**

The JustAnswer Platform is an online venue for informational and educational purposes and connects Customers with Experts. JustAnswer is not in the business of providing or selling information or education that is within any Expert’s area of expertise, and JustAnswer otherwise does not provide advice or any professional service to Customers. Users of the Platform, not JustAnswer, provide the content in Posts (defined below). Experts are not employees or agents of JustAnswer. JustAnswer is not acting as an agent for any Customer. Experts have sole discretion in selecting which questions from Customers to answer, may elect not to answer any questions from Customers, and have sole discretion in controlling how to perform any services on the Platform.

We are not involved in the conversations you may engage in with other Users on the Platform. JustAnswer shall not be liable for (a) any acts or omissions by you, (b) content in posts made by Users on the Platform, including questions, answers, requests for information, responses, profiles, Expert signatures, qualifications, comments, profile information, and posts in the Expert Forum and other places where Users communicate with one another (collectively “Posts”), or (c) an Expert’s failure to complete a transaction. You further understand that site tools, JustAnswer’s mobile application or any other tools (collectively, “Tools”) offered by JustAnswer are optional and such Tools are purely offered for convenience and usage of such Tools is not mandatory. You understand certain Tools, such as chatbots, may utilize or be powered by AI language models, and data input into such Tools shall be subject to these Terms, our Privacy Policy, and any other disclosures presented in connection with such Tools. You understand JustAnswer may also allow Experts to use certain Tools at their option, which may utilize AI language models or other automated technology to for example help Experts communicate with other Users on the Platform. You are solely responsible for transactions you make with Experts on the Platform, including honoring any payment obligations.

JustAnswer does not refer Customers to or endorse or recommend particular Experts. JustAnswer shall not be liable for any acts or omissions of Experts, Posts, or the ability of Experts to answer questions. We cannot ensure that an Expert will complete a transaction. You understand and acknowledge that JustAnswer cannot and does not edit, modify, filter, screen, monitor, endorse or guarantee the content of Posts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, JustAnswer reserves the right, but is not obligated, to refuse to post or to remove any content and/or remove any User’s access to the Platform for any reason, including violation of these Terms.

EMERGENCY QUESTIONS AND CRISIS SITUATIONS (particularly regarding medical or mental health issues) should not be directed to the Platform and should, instead be directed immediately by telephone or in-person to qualified professionals (e.g. in the U.S., call 911). The Platform is not the appropriate venue to deal with such situations.

Use of the term “Expert” by JustAnswer and on the Platform is only meant to describe Users who answer questions on the Platform, and not to guarantee any particular level of expertise of these Experts.

JustAnswer is not responsible for mediating disputes between Customers and Experts.

Every Expert on the Platform has had at least one credential, where applicable, relevant to the category in which they are answering questions that is verified by a third-party verification service.

JustAnswer contracts with third-party service providers to perform the verifications described above. The results of the verifications are only as accurate as the information provided to and by the third-party verification service, as of the time of the providing of information to and by the third-party verification services. JustAnswer cannot warrant or guarantee an Expert's purported identity and cannot and does not represent, warrant, or guarantee the truthfulness or accuracy of the credentials or identities of Users and information provided by Users including Experts. You acknowledge that JustAnswer will not be liable for any loss or damages caused by your reliance on any information or content contained in Posts.

**Answers Experts provide on the Platform are to be used by Customers for general information purposes only, not as a substitute for in-person evaluation or specific professional (medical, legal, veterinary, tax, financial, etc.) advice. No professional-client relationships shall be formed on the Platform.** For example, Experts in the Legal category will provide only general information about the law and will not provide legal advice nor propose a specific course of action for a Customer. By answering questions, Experts do not intend to form, and do not form attorney-client or doctor-patient relationships with Users of the Platform. The laws, regulations, other governing authorities, standards, practices, and procedures that apply to your particular question may differ depending on your location and information typically discovered through in-person evaluations or visits. Experts in some categories may be licensed, certified, educated, employed by or have experience in only particular jurisdictions. Communications on this Platform are not confidential and shall not be the subject of any associated privileges. Communications on this Platform are limited, as described above, do not involve in-person evaluations or visits, and do not include safeguards and procedures typical of in-person evaluations and visits.

**3\. Additional Premium Services**

**You may be presented with an offer for services outside of the Platform’ standard question-and-answer platform (“Additional Premium Services”).**

JustAnswer is only a venue which facilitates communication between Experts and potential Users of Additional Premium Services. It does not provide any of the substance or content of any Additional Premium Services initiated through JustAnswer’s Platform.

**JustAnswer will in no way be liable for any acts or omissions of Experts in performing Additional Premium Services (or any services) for you or any issues that may arise before, during, or after any Additional Premium Service.**

Additional Premium Services may be: (1) “Information Only;” or (2) “Beyond Information Only.” “Information Only” Additional Premium Services are those additional services outside the Platform’s standard question-and-answer platform and may be conducted off the Platform (either by phone, chat, email, remote desktop, or any other third-party tool) but remain for general informational services only. “Beyond Information Only” services facilitate Users’ exchange off Platform that are more than informational and that could potentially evolve into a professional relationship. Charges for Additional Premium Platform will be described in the particular offer. JustAnswer or the Expert may record communications during Additional Premium Services.

c. JustAnswer will endeavor to find an Expert relevant to your request for Beyond Information Only Additional Premium Services. Nevertheless, JustAnswer does not guarantee that any Expert who contacts you can fulfill your request for Beyond Information Only Additional Premium Services.

a. Any Information Only Additional Premium Services you receive from a legal, tax, medical or veterinary professional are for general informational purposes only.

c. The Information Only Additional Premium Services are not subject to an attorney-client/ accountant-client/doctor-patient relationship or attorney-client/ accountant-client/doctor-patient privilege. Before applying the Information Only Additional Premium Services to your specific situation, you should consult with a professional licensed to practice in your jurisdiction.

_Terms Relating to Remote Desktop Users_

If you agree to accept Remote Desktop Services (whether such services are Information Only or Beyond Information Only) from an Expert, by accepting such offer for services, you are agreeing to give the Expert full access to and control over your computer (including permission to download and use software on your computer, gather system data, modify settings, etc.) for computer diagnosis, service, and repair. You agree that any third-party software acquired, installed, or used during the Remote Desktop session, by you or by the Expert, will be licensed to you, and that any terms of use relating to the third-party software are agreed to by you, that an Expert may record via video the Remote Desktop Session for security purposes, and that you will not use the Platform to do anything unlawful.

**9\. Fees, Refund and Cancellation Policy**

JustAnswer’s platform allows Customers to post questions to Experts in subject-matter categories, facilitates communication with Experts on the Platform via chat, emails, and online message boards, and enables delivery of and access to answers to your questions (“Site Access Benefits”). Site Access Benefits may have additional terms such as limits on the number and/or subject matter of questions provided at the time of sign up. Customers on the Platform may be presented with one of three payment models: (1) ongoing membership; (2) additional Platform model (which is explained in Section E below); and (3) pay-per-question model.

_Membership & Membership Renewal._ Memberships allow Customers to receive Site Access Benefits on the Platform for auto-renewing time periods (e.g., monthly, annually) set forth at the time of sign up. Customers who elect to pay for memberships are hereinafter referred to as “Members” and your participation in the Platform is a “Membership.” Unless otherwise stated on your sign-up page, when you sign up for Membership, you agree that you are subscribing to an automatically renewing Membership requiring recurring payments at the stated frequency (e.g., monthly or annually) at the then-current price until you cancel. You will be charged your first Membership fee and any applicable taxes on the date you purchase your Membership or, if applicable, after your free trial ends. Your Membership will automatically continue at the selected interval, and you will continue to be charged at the then-current price (including any applicable taxes), unless at least 24 hours prior to the end of the current Membership period: (a) you terminate your account; (b) you cancel your Membership (as described below); (c) we decline to renew your Membership; or (d) these Terms are otherwise properly terminated as expressly permitted herein. Membership fees are non-refundable except as expressly set forth in these Terms or in accordance with applicable law. If any Membership fee is not paid in a timely manner, or your transaction cannot be processed, we reserve the right to suspend, disable, cancel or terminate your Membership. You will be responsible for paying all past due amounts. You acknowledge that billing may not occur on the exact same date of each month.

JustAnswer will send notice of upcoming automatic renewal prior to renewing your membership as required by law. We reserve the right to change the terms of your Membership, including price or in scope Site Access Benefits, from time to time. We will attempt to provide advanced notice of any changes in Membership fees or prices prior to the next billing cycle, but this will not include notification of changes in applicable taxes. If you do not wish to accept a fee or price change, you may cancel your Membership in accordance with these Terms.

_Sign Up Fees._ Some Customers/Members may be charged a sign-up fee disclosed at the time of sign up for a Membership. The fee is automatically charged to the Member’s payment source provided on the Platform.

_App Store Memberships._ Memberships purchased via the app—not on JustAnswer’s website—are managed directly by the applicable App Store. Consult the appropriate App Store to determine if the price charged includes all applicable taxes and currency exchange settlements. You are solely responsible for paying such taxes or other charges. JustAnswer relies on the App Store to collect subscription fees, manage the subscription for your memberships, and to report on the status of subscription accounts that have been purchased from within the app. JustAnswer does not have the ability to manage any aspect of an App Store subscription membership on your behalf, including, but not limited to, initiating, canceling, or refunding subscriptions.

_Membership Cancellation or Termination._ When you cancel a subscription, you cancel only future charges associated with your membership. You may initiate your cancellation at any time, but the cancellation will become effective at the end of your current subscription period. You can cancel your Membership at any time up to 24 hours before the end of the current billing period by (1) clicking the cancel membership button on either the help center page or your account’s membership page; (2) sending a written notice of cancellation via e-mail to [\[email protected\]](https://www.justanswer.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection); (3) talking to a customer support agent via our online chatbot or through calling 1-800-581-6476; or (4) for subscriptions purchased through a third party App Store or platform, through that third party. No refunds will be provided for a partial Membership period, but you will continue to have access to the Site Access Benefits until the next billing cycle. Notwithstanding any other terms, JustAnswer reserves the right to cancel your JustAnswer Membership in its entirety at any time and for any reason, with or without prior notice. In the event that JustAnswer cancels a JustAnswer Membership, it will refund the current period’s fee.

_Trials & Promotions._ We may offer promotional trial subscriptions to obtain a Membership on a trial basis or access Platform for free or at promotional rate, as well as referral discounts or similar free access to Member benefits when you refer a new user(s). If your subscription includes a free trial, you will not be charged the applicable fee during your free trial. To obtain the free trial, you will be required to provide a credit card or other payment method in order to ensure uninterrupted access and continued use after the expiration of the free trial. Upon completion of your free trial, your subscription will automatically convert into a paid Membership and your payment method will be charged the applicable fee unless you have cancelled your Membership. You may cancel your Membership during your free trial to avoid being charged as described above.

If your subscription includes a promotional rate, you will be charged the promotional rate for the relevant number of billing periods and upon completion of that period, your subscription will continue to automatically renew at the full rate. You may only be permitted to use one free trial or discounted price offer. If your Membership is ever cancelled or terminated for any reason, and you purchase an additional Membership, you may not be eligible for a free trial or to take advantage of another discounted price offer.

Any promotional monies or credits placed into Customer accounts by JustAnswer for use towards Site Access Benefits on the Platform remain the property of JustAnswer (they never become the property of Customers and never become refundable to the Customer), and unless otherwise stated on the Platform or in an email to a Customer, will be usable only for thirty (30) days.

_Pay-Per-Question._ Certain customers may have the option to participate on the Platform with the pay-per-question model. Using Pay-Per-Question, you select the price that you are willing to pay for the Site Access Benefits for a single question. Once you have selected the price and submitted your payment information, your question may be posted on JustAnswer. A portion of your payments will be paid to the Expert and a portion to JustAnswer. You will be charged in one of three ways depending on the payment source, as described on the payment page: (i) when the question is posted; (ii) at the time an Expert responds to the Customer’s question; or (iii) $5 upon the posting of a question, with the remainder of the selected price charged at the time an Expert responds. Charges are not refundable except as expressly permitted in these Terms.

_Rating the Expert._ Experts typically respond to Customers’ questions quickly. If the Expert requests further information before answering your question, you may wish to take advantage of the opportunity to provide more information to the Expert to allow the Expert to help you better. Once the Expert answers your question, you will be asked to rate the Expert. JustAnswer does not guarantee that you will receive a response from an Expert, or that you will be satisfied with your communication with an Expert. For Pay-Per-Question Customers, in the rare instance that no Expert responds at all to your question, you agree that any amount up to $5 that was charged upon posting of your question may be retained by JustAnswer in consideration for the Site Access Benefits received. See Refunds section below for information on requesting a refund.

_Additional Premium Services Fees._ Any amounts a Customer pays for Additional Premium Services are divided into two parts: (i) JustAnswer’s fee for enabling the request, offer, and/or fulfillment of Additional _Premium_ Services (“Additional Site Access Benefits”); and (ii) the Expert’s fee for the specific Additional _Premium_ Service provided to the User. Once you accept an offer for Additional _Premium_ Services, your payment method on file, if any, will be automatically charged the Additional _Premium_ Services amount.

_Additional Membership Terms & Changes._ Members will be bound by their Membership Details so please be sure to review them carefully. We may change the Membership terms or fees at any time on a going forward basis in our discretion. If the pricing for your Membership increases, we will notify you, and provide you an opportunity to change your subscription before applying those changes to your account or charging you in connection with an automatic renewal. We may choose in our sole discretion to add, modify, or remove benefits and features from a Membership. Your continued use of the Platform after the changes become effective will constitute your acceptance of the changes. If you do not wish to continue subscribing with the new fees or features, you may cancel your Membership. If you accept the new Membership subscription, its terms and conditions will apply for that renewal and all renewals going forward

_Additional Fees and Expert Bonuses._ JustAnswer may charge additional fees, including but not limited to service fees for use of the Platform or for submission of questions, and change such fees, as we deem necessary or appropriate for our business. Customers may have the opportunity to provide Experts bonuses or tips. You authorize JustAnswer to charge your payment method for any bonus or tip you elect to provide. Except as otherwise provided on the Platform, JustAnswer shall retain 3% of such bonus or tip.

_Payment Information._ When you provide payment information, you represent and warrant that the information is accurate and that you are authorized to use the payment method provided for any payments due, including Membership fees, pay per question fees, service fees, taxes, and tips or bonuses you elect to provide. You acknowledge that we may process an authorization hold using your payment information in order to verify the information provided. You are responsible for keeping your payment details up to date by changing the details in your account setting. If your payment card details change or are due to expire, we may obtain or receive from your payment provider updated payment details including your card number, expiration date, and CVV (or equivalent). You authorize us to continue to charge your card using the updated information so that you can continue to receive your Membership.

If you do not pay any fees when due (for example, due to credit card expiration or insufficient funds), we may suspend or terminate your access to the Platform or your Membership. We also reserve the right to pursue any amounts you fail to pay in connection with your use of the Platform or your Membership.

_Taxes._ Experts are responsible for any and all applicable federal, state, and local taxes, duties, tariffs, levies, withholdings, and similar assessments (including without limitation, sales, use, and value added taxes) relating to the subject matter hereunder, excluding taxes based on JustAnswer’s income.

**18\. Arbitration and Class Action Waiver**

PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.

**If you are using the Platform as an Expert (as defined in the Expert Agreement) with a dispute, claim, or controversy of any sort and of any nature (collectively, “dispute”) against JustAnswer in your capacity as an Expert, then the arbitration agreement in the Expert Agreement applies instead of this one. If your dispute with JustAnswer is made in your capacity as User who is not using the Platform in your capacity as an Expert, then the following dispute resolution provisions apply.**

**If you have a dispute with JustAnswer or if JustAnswer has a dispute with you and such dispute cannot be resolved informally, such dispute will be resolved on an individual basis in accordance with the provisions set forth below:**

a. Initial Dispute Resolution

Our Support Department is available to address any concerns you may have regarding the Platform. Our Support Department can resolve most concerns quickly to our Users’ satisfaction. The parties shall use their best efforts through this Support process to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement and engage in good faith negotiations which shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. Failure to engage in this process could result in the award of fees against you in arbitration. To adequately engage in initial dispute resolution, each party must notify the other party, in writing, of the facts of the dispute and all damages claimed. Such a writing must be sent to (a) the User’s email address on file with JustAnswer, or (b) JustAnswer LLC, 440 N. Barranca Ave #7508, Covina, CA 9172, or (c) [\[email protected\]](https://www.justanswer.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection), whichever is applicable (“Dispute Notification”). The party receiving the Dispute Notification has thirty (30) days from receipt of the Dispute Notification to respond. The other party then has 15 days to reply to the response.

b. Binding Arbitration

If the parties do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of 30 days from the time informal dispute resolution begins under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to the terms set forth below. This agreement to arbitrate is a contract governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. section 1, et seq., and evidences a transaction involving commerce. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms (including their formation, performance, and breach), the parties’ relationship with each other, and/or your use of the Platform and any Platform made available through the Platform shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by JAMS in accordance with the provisions of its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class or representative actions and except that each party will be permitted at least one deposition unless forbidden by JAMS. If for any reason JAMS is unable to administer arbitration, either party may apply to a court to appoint an arbitrator pursuant to 9 U.S.C. section 5.

Except as explicitly set forth in this Section 18, the arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, and any dispute regarding the payment of JAMS administrative or arbitrator fees (including the timing of such payments and remedies for nonpayment). The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator shall also be empowered to consolidate claims raised between the same parties to a single arbitration proceeding. The parties agree that the arbitrator may allow the filing of dispositive motions if they are likely to efficiently resolve or narrow issues in dispute. The arbitrator’s award shall be written and binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. No arbitration award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute with anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration.

The Streamlined Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at (800) 352-5267. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, you will be required to pay $250 to initiate the arbitration. To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, the arbitrator may require JustAnswer to pay the additional cost. You are responsible for your own attorneys’ fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise. If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, JustAnswer will pay the remaining filing and arbitrator fees for the arbitration, provided your claim does not exceed $75,000. For claims above $75,000, fees and costs will be determined in accordance with applicable JAMS rules. The arbitration rules permit you to recover attorney’s fees in certain cases.

Any arbitration demand or counterclaim asserted by either party must contain sufficient information to provide fair notice to the other party of the asserting party’s identity, the claims being asserted, and the factual allegations on which they are based. The arbitrator and/or JAMS may require amendment of any demand or counterclaim that does not satisfy these requirements. The arbitrator has the right to impose sanctions in accordance with JAMS Rule 24 for any claims the arbitrator determines to be frivolous or improper (under the standard set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11).

The parties agree that JAMS has discretion to modify the amount or timing of any administrative or arbitration fees due under JAMS’s Rules where it deems appropriate, provided that such modification does not increase the costs to you, and you waive any objection to such fee modification. The parties also agree that a good-faith challenge by either party to the fees imposed by JAMS does not constitute a default, waiver, or breach of this Section 18 while such challenge remains pending before JAMS, the arbitrator, and/or a court of competent jurisdiction.

The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.

c. Location

If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration will take place at any reasonable location within the United States convenient for you. You and JustAnswer agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in Ada County, Idaho in order to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

d. Class Action Waiver

The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND JUSTANSWER AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Notwithstanding any other provision of these terms, disputes regarding the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of the Class Action Waiver may be resolved only by a court and not by an arbitrator. If there is a final judicial determination that applicable law precludes enforcement of this paragraph’s limitations as to a particular remedy, then that remedy (and only that remedy) must be severed from the arbitration and may be sought in court. The parties agree, however, that any adjudication of remedies not subject to arbitration shall be stayed pending the outcome of any arbitrable claims and remedies.

e. Exception - Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims

Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court to protect its intellectual property rights (“intellectual property rights” means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights). Either party may also elect to have disputes or claims resolved in a small claims court that are within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction. Either party may also seek a declaratory judgment or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction regarding whether a party’s claims are time-barred or may be brought in small claims court in your state and county of residence. Seeking such relief shall not waive a party’s right to arbitration under this agreement.

f. 30-Day Right to Opt Out

You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following email address: [\[email protected\]](https://www.justanswer.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). The notice must be sent within 30 days of the Effective Date of these Terms of Service or your first use of the Platform, whichever is later, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those paragraphs. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, JustAnswer also will not be bound by them.

g. Changes to this Section.

JustAnswer will provide 30 days’ notice of any changes affecting the substance of this Section 18. Changes will become effective on the 30th day. If you continue to use the Platform after the 30th day, you agree that any unfiled claims of which JustAnswer does not have actual notice are subject to the revised clause.

**19\. Venue and Governing Law**

For any dispute not subject to arbitration or under the jurisdiction of a small claims court, you and JustAnswer agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of any venue in the federal and state courts located in Ada County, Idaho. You further agree to accept service of process by mail, and hereby waive any and all jurisdictional and venue defenses otherwise available.

The Terms and the relationship between you and JustAnswer shall be governed by the laws of the State of Idaho without regard to conflict of law provisions.

[![](https://ww2-secure.justanswer.com/static/fe/he-page-tos/topIcon.png)](#topAnchor)

**20\. Application License**

Subject to your compliance with these Terms, JustAnswer grants you a limited non-exclusive, non-transferable license to download and install a copy of JustAnswer mobile app on a device that you exclusively control and to run such copy of the app solely for your own personal use. JustAnswer reserves all rights in and to the app not expressly granted to you under these Terms. You will not run any version of the app on a jailbroken device.

If you have downloaded our app, you agree to promptly download and install any new version that we make available through the iTunes App Store or Google Play store, as applicable. Some new versions may contain updated Terms. Some new versions may contain security fixes and service improvements, whether or not we disclose that they do; accordingly, failure to promptly update your version of the App may in some cases expose you to increased security risks or Platform malfunctions.

[![](https://ww2-secure.justanswer.com/static/fe/he-page-tos/topIcon.png)](#topAnchor)

**21\. General**

_Entire Agreement._ These Terms (and any additional terms, contracts, rules, and conditions that JustAnswer may post on the Platform), the Privacy Policy, and, if applicable, the Expert Agreement constitute the entire agreement between you and JustAnswer with respect to the Platform and supersede any prior agreements, oral or written, between you and JustAnswer. For those Users who have become Experts, nothing in this Agreement supersedes the terms of the Expert Agreement, and in the event of a conflict between this Agreement (or later versions of this Agreement) and the Expert Agreement, the terms of the Expert Agreement shall prevail. This Agreement, the Privacy Policy, and disclaimers will prevail over FAQs, and other rules and policies on the Platform.

_Waiver and Severability._ If any provision(s) of the Terms is held by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, then such provision(s) shall be construed, as nearly as possible, to reflect the intentions of the parties and the other provisions shall remain in full force and effect. JustAnswer’s failure to exercise or enforce any of the Terms shall not constitute a waiver of JustAnswer’s right to exercise or enforce the Terms as to the same or another instance.

_Assignment._ You agree that JustAnswer may assign the Terms to any other entity of its choosing, with or without notice to you. You may not assign the Terms to any other party for any reason, including, but not limited to, because your interaction with other users of the Platform, the pricing offered, and fraud mechanisms in place are based upon individual usage.

_Section Titles._ The section titles in the Terms are solely used for the convenience of the parties and have no legal or contractual significance.

_Statute of Limitations._ You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to the use of the Platform or the Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. This statute of limitations provision does not apply to residents of New Jersey.

_Notice._ JustAnswer may give notice by any means of communication reasonably anticipated to notify you of the information provided. You agree that all notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing or be delivered in a particular manner. You agree that you have the ability to store such electronic communications such that they remain accessible to you in an unchanged form. By way of example only, such communication may be a general notice on the Platform or via email to the email address listed on your Account. It is your obligation to update your Account information so that we may contact you as may be necessary. Such notice shall be deemed to have been given 48 hours after dispatch. If physical notice (e.g., US Mail) is used, then such notice shall be deemed to have been given 7 days after dispatch. Except as explicitly described in the “Arbitration and Class Action Waiver” section, you may give notice to JustAnswer (such notice shall be deemed given when received by JustAnswer) at any time by contacting us in writing through JustAnswer’s Help Center.

_No Third-Party Beneficiaries._ You agree that, except as otherwise expressly provided in these Terms, there shall be no third-party beneficiaries to these Terms.

**23\. iOS Terms**

You acknowledge and agree that (i) these Terms are binding between you and JustAnswer only, and Apple is not a party hereto, and (ii) as between JustAnswer and Apple, it is JustAnswer that is responsible for the app and the content thereof. You must use the iOS app only on an Apple-branded product that runs iOS. Your use of the app must comply with the terms of use applicable to the Apple source from which you obtain it (including the Usage Rules set forth in the Apple App Store Terms of Service). You acknowledge that Apple has no obligation to furnish you with any maintenance and support Platform with respect to the app.

You acknowledge that Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims you have or any claims of any third party relating to the app or your possession and use of the app, including, but not limited to, (i) product warranty or liability claims; (ii) any claim that the app fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation; or (iv) claims that the app infringes a third party’s intellectual property rights.

In the event of any failure of the iOS version of the app to conform to any applicable warranty that has not been effectively disclaimed by these Terms, you may notify Apple, and Apple will refund the purchase price for the app (if any) to you; to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the app, and, as between Apple and JustAnswer, any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs, or expenses attributable to any failure to conform to any warranty will be JustAnswer’s responsibility, but only to the extent provided by these Terms. Please read the entire Terms, as other sections of these Terms limit JustAnswer’s liability in this regard.

Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms. Upon your acceptance of the Terms, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce the Terms against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof.
