Please note that if you do lodge a dispute with the European Commission Online Dispute Resolution website (or any other consumer arbitration service), we may decline to participate in the arbitration as we are not required by law, the rules of any trade association or by these terms to participate in a consumer arbitration.

    We may make changes which are immaterial or to your advantage immediately and without notice.
10. **Severability.** If a court of competent jurisdiction decides than any part of this LSA is invalid or unenforceable, the rest of the LSA shall still apply and remain fully enforceable.
11. **General.** Our failure to enforce any terms of the LSA is not a waiver of such term or right. Any waiver of our rights must be in writing, signed by NortonLifeLock, and any such waiver shall not operate as a waiver of any future breach. Except as expressly set forth in this LSA, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under this LSA shall not affect its other remedies under this LSA or otherwise. Any notices or other communications provided by NortonLifeLock under this LSA will be given: (i) via email; or (ii) by posting online; or (iii) by posting to the Services.
