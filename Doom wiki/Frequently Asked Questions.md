Article content\[[edit](https://doomwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Doom_Wiki:FAQ&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Article content")\]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Can I write an article about myself / my clan?\[[edit](https://doomwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Doom_Wiki:FAQ&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Can I write an article about myself / my clan?")\]

In most cases, no.

Our encyclopedia includes people who have made memorable and widely known contributions to the Doom community. If you have done that, you don't need to create an article, because your reputation will make it appear.

If you write about yourself anyway, be prepared for an uncomfortable conversation about whether or not you qualify. Even if the article stays, remember that [you don't control its content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Ownership_of_content "wikipedia:Wikipedia:Ownership of content"). It may grow to include every significant Doom-related thing you have done, [no matter how embarrassing](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Doom_Wiki:Policies_and_guidelines#Neutrality "Doom Wiki:Policies and guidelines").

### Can I write an article about my mod?\[[edit](https://doomwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Doom_Wiki:FAQ&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Can I write an article about my mod?")\]

No. Such articles will most likely be deleted.

We have no black-and-white standard for a [PWAD](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/PWAD "PWAD") or other add-on to be declared ["notable"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability "wikipedia:Wikipedia:Notability"). In practice, however, "notable" projects are at least one of these:

* incredibly popular (e.g. [DWANGO5](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Dwango5 "Dwango5"), [DeHackEd](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/DeHackEd "DeHackEd"));
* widely acclaimed ([Aliens TC](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Aliens_TC "Aliens TC"), [Skulltag](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Skulltag "Skulltag"));
* historically important ([Origwad](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Origwad "Origwad"), [Impse](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Impse "Impse"));
* contextually significant ([Jumpmaze series](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Template:Jumpmaze_series "Template:Jumpmaze series"), [Odamex CTF](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Odamex_CTF "Odamex CTF"))

On _rare_ occasions this has included unreleased material, but only if the hype itself is significant within the community (e.g. [Crucified Dreams](https://doomwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Crucified_Dreams&action=history), [Congestion 1024](https://doomwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Congestion_1024&action=history)). It has also been decided that some modifications which are primarily notable for being notoriously bad, attracting universally negative attention at a large scale level, should be documented.

### I added some trivia to an article, but another user removed it. Isn't trivia allowed here?\[[edit](https://doomwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Doom_Wiki:FAQ&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: I added some trivia to an article, but another user removed it. Isn't trivia allowed here?")\]

First, read the _entire page_ to make sure it isn't already there.

Next, is the information documented in a public place within the Doom community? If not, it is [original research](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Doom_Wiki:Policies_and_guidelines#Original_research "Doom Wiki:Policies and guidelines"). Please compare your trivia to the examples in that list before deciding that you absolutely, positively must include it.

### I uploaded a picture, but another user complained. Why?\[[edit](https://doomwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Doom_Wiki:FAQ&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: I uploaded a picture, but another user complained. Why?")\]

Although the [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/How_does_MediaWiki_work%3F "mw:How does MediaWiki work?") interface makes it very easy to add images, they are often controversial. Some likely explanations are:

* You uploaded a [copyrighted image](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Doom_Wiki:Copyrights "Doom Wiki:Copyrights") which does not fall into one of a few standard categories: unmodified in-game screenshot, map view, or media cover art. (For legal reasons, exceptions to this policy have to be justified, or the image gets deleted.)
* A nearly identical image already exists.
* You did not create the image yourself.
* You photoshopped the image.
* You did not select an option from the licensing menu.
* The image has a nonstandard [aspect ratio](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Aspect_ratio "Aspect ratio") or [game UI](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Heads-up_display "Heads-up display"). (This is easy to fix by simply replacing the file.)
* You did not place the image in an article, and no one could figure out its intended purpose.

### This site is all about Doom, but doesn't provide any download links. Should I add one?\[[edit](https://doomwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Doom_Wiki:FAQ&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: This site is all about Doom, but doesn't provide any download links. Should I add one?")\]

The Doom series is not [freeware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/freeware "wikipedia:freeware"), so no, you shouldn't.

### Why is the Doom 3 material incomplete?\[[edit](https://doomwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Doom_Wiki:FAQ&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Why is the Doom 3 material incomplete?")\]

Every editor here is an unpaid volunteer. We work on articles when we can find the time. On the other hand, this includes you: if you know [Doom 3](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Category:Doom_3 "Category:Doom 3") and you see information missing, feel free to add it! You are welcome to add a page at any time.

Article maintenance\[[edit](https://doomwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Doom_Wiki:FAQ&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Article maintenance")\]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Why is there a "cleanup" or "stub" banner at the top of the page I created?\[[edit](https://doomwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Doom_Wiki:FAQ&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Why is there a "cleanup" or "stub" banner at the top of the page I created?")\]

When you click _Save_, you are opening the article for collaboration by the entire wiki community, and the [maintenance categories](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Category:Article_management "Category:Article management") make that process easier to organize. Our goal is for every page to be polished and comprehensive, which is almost impossible for a brand new article, given the long history of the Doom series and the huge amount of technical data available.

If for some reason you must edit an article slowly with no interruptions, you can do it in a text editor (such as [Notepad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Notepad "wikipedia:Windows Notepad")), or on [a subpage of your user page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:User_pages#Creating_a_subpage "wikipedia:Wikipedia:User pages").

### I added a link to Entryway, but another user removed it. Why?\[[edit](https://doomwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Doom_Wiki:FAQ&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: I added a link to Entryway, but another user removed it. Why?")\]

[Entryway](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Entryway "Entryway") is intended as a starting point for navigation, not a complete index. We do not want the page to keep growing until it is too long for a newbie to digest. Huge agglomerations of links may also decrease our [Google ranking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization "wikipedia:Search engine optimization").

### This article looks like it was written by my 4-year-old cousin. How do I delete it?\[[edit](https://doomwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Doom_Wiki:FAQ&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: This article looks like it was written by my 4-year-old cousin. How do I delete it?")\]

A [wiki](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Wiki "Wiki") by its nature contains a large number of incomplete pages. Is the subject important to the Doom community? A messy article about a relevant topic can be improved into a good article, or merged into a broader article if the amount of new content is small.

That said, if the existing text is [complete gibberish](http://en.uncyclopedia.co/w/index.php?title=Mr._T&oldid=4618440#The_Silver_Chains_of_Darkness) or you are certain that the topic is unsalvageable, any [registered user](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Help:User_access_levels "Help:User access levels") can [nominate an article for deletion](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Doom_Wiki:Policies_and_guidelines#Deletion "Doom Wiki:Policies and guidelines").

### I posted to a talk page to get opinions, but nobody replied. Now what?\[[edit](https://doomwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Doom_Wiki:FAQ&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: I posted to a talk page to get opinions, but nobody replied. Now what?")\]

If your action would be extremely difficult to reverse (e.g. making 50,000 edits with an automated script), start a thread at [Central Processing](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Doom_Wiki:Central_Processing "Doom Wiki:Central Processing") and explain the idea in detail. Otherwise, just start editing. If someone has a question, you'll see it on that same talk page, or on your personal talk page.

### I've cleaned up spam / vandalism from the same user several times. How do I get them banned?\[[edit](https://doomwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Doom_Wiki:FAQ&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: I've cleaned up spam / vandalism from the same user several times. How do I get them banned?")\]

You can post to [Central Processing](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Doom_Wiki:Central_Processing "Doom Wiki:Central Processing") or contact any [administrator](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Doom_Wiki:Administrators "Doom Wiki:Administrators"). If it's urgent, try [one of the Doom-related IRC channels](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Help:User_groups#Administrators "Help:User groups").

### Where can I experiment with or draft a page? Is there a sandbox?\[[edit](https://doomwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Doom_Wiki:FAQ&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Where can I experiment with or draft a page? Is there a sandbox?")\]

Learning to [write wiki markup](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Formatting "mw:Help:Formatting"), testing complex layouts or tables, or drafting an article to solicit feedback, are activities better done in a user sandbox than in the main wiki. [A user sandbox](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Special:MyPage/Sandbox "Special:MyPage/Sandbox") can be any path below your [user page](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Special:MyPage "Special:MyPage"), and doesn't need to be named Sandbox (but that helps make its purpose clear). See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:ABOUTSAND "wikipedia:WP:ABOUTSAND") for more information on sandboxing, although not all their technical facilities are available here.

Site policies\[[edit](https://doomwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Doom_Wiki:FAQ&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Site policies")\]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### What are your official terms of use?\[[edit](https://doomwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Doom_Wiki:FAQ&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: What are your official terms of use?")\]

The official policies governing all use of the site can be found [here](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Doom_Wiki:Terms_of_use "Doom Wiki:Terms of use"). Community-determined guidelines, which are additive to the terms of use, can be found at [Policies and guidelines](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Doom_Wiki:Policies_and_guidelines "Doom Wiki:Policies and guidelines"). Information here is established in accordance with both of these documents.

### Why are you so anal about bad grammar / topic drift? This is just a gaming site.\[[edit](https://doomwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Doom_Wiki:FAQ&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Why are you so anal about bad grammar / topic drift? This is just a gaming site.")\]

If you can only remember one sentence from this FAQ, here it is:

_**The Doom Wiki is a reference work, not a social networking site.**_

When you open a dictionary or an economics textbook, you expect a formal tone and a logically organized outline; the same applies here. Articles should contain coherent expository prose, not conversation or excessive decoration. Talk pages are less organized, but questions and comments should be about improving the encyclopedia content, not random subjects.

If you don't agree with these ideas, that's fine; there are thousands of other gaming sites for you to try. At [Doomworld.com](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Doomworld "Doomworld"), for example, people chat about Doom all day long. You could even [create a new wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_wiki_hosting_services "wikipedia:Comparison of wiki hosting services") about Doom or any other game.

### Why are there so many rules? Isn't this site just like Wikipedia?\[[edit](https://doomwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Doom_Wiki:FAQ&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Why are there so many rules? Isn't this site just like Wikipedia?")\]

Although we use the same [database engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki "wikipedia:MediaWiki") and have similar ["encyclopedic" content goals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not "wikipedia:Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not") to Wikipedia's, almost everything else is different. You should never assume that a Wikipedia policy applies here without [checking first](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Doom_Wiki:Policies_and_guidelines "Doom Wiki:Policies and guidelines").

Some important differences include:

* The Doom Wiki is much, much smaller. The pace is slow; almost no one logs in daily. Therefore, it can take weeks to have an in-depth conversation on a talk page, and months to change a policy.
* As a corollary, [silence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Silence_and_consensus "wikipedia:Wikipedia:Silence and consensus") is normally interpreted as consensus ([see above](#I_posted_to_a_talk_page_to_get_opinions.2C_but_nobody_replied._Now_what.3F)).
* There are no [robots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bot_policy "wikipedia:Wikipedia:Bot policy") or [gnomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiGnome "wikipedia:Wikipedia:WikiGnome") to revert vandalism and clean up sloppy edits. If you see a problem, consider fixing it, or it may still be there 2 years from now.
* [Assuming good faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith "wikipedia:Wikipedia:Assume good faith") is often counterproductive among gamers.
* [Administrators](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Doom_Wiki:Administrators "Doom Wiki:Administrators") spend 99 percent of their time writing articles, and use their special abilities only when absolutely necessary.
* [Neutral Point of View](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Doom_Wiki:Policies_and_guidelines#Original_research "Doom Wiki:Policies and guidelines") is not an inflexible rule.
* A "blocked user" and a "banned user" [are the same thing](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Doom_Wiki:Policies_and_guidelines#Banning "Doom Wiki:Policies and guidelines"). In Wikipedia language: some bans are temporary, but all bans are enforced by blocks, and all are sitewide (no topic bans, interaction bans, or discretionary sanctions).

On talk pages, linked Wikipedia guidelines are usually intended to emphasize the poster's individual argument, not to allude to a broad unwritten rule.

### Do you seriously expect me to memorize all these rules before I contribute?\[[edit](https://doomwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Doom_Wiki:FAQ&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Do you seriously expect me to memorize all these rules before I contribute?")\]

No. We try to make decisions using common sense whenever possible. However, every section on those pages was added for a good reason, usually to avoid repeating a specific disaster. If you appear to be totally ignoring a policy or guideline, you should expect a polite reminder ([see below](#What_if_I_disagree_with_a_policy_or_guideline.3F)).

### What if I disagree with a policy or guideline?\[[edit](https://doomwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Doom_Wiki:FAQ&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: What if I disagree with a policy or guideline?")\]

A certain amount of this is normal and healthy on an evolving wiki. New contributors arrive and bring new perspectives to the situation. Perhaps the circumstances of the original policy discussion have changed over the years. _Before_ undertaking a large campaign of edits to support your belief, however, please propose them on [Central Processing](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Doom_Wiki:Central_Processing "Doom Wiki:Central Processing") and wait a week or two for any responses.

If you are convinced that the same situation will recur in the future, you can even edit the policy or guideline (the pages aren't locked), but be prepared to explain your reasoning at some length.

### There's a long debate happening on a talk page. It's going in circles and we're all frustrated. Will an admin please step in and choose a winner?\[[edit](https://doomwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Doom_Wiki:FAQ&action=edit&section=21 "Edit section: There's a long debate happening on a talk page. It's going in circles and we're all frustrated. Will an admin please step in and choose a winner?")\]

Unlike other gaming sites, [administrators](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Doom_Wiki:Administrators "Doom Wiki:Administrators") here have no special authority over the content.

If a dispute is in danger of exploding into a site-wide problem (such as mass vandalism or stalking), by all means contact an admin right away. Otherwise, the participants simply must continue to seek compromise, or solicit more input on [Central Processing](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Doom_Wiki:Central_Processing "Doom Wiki:Central Processing").

### A user is making confusing edits, or posting nonsense on talk pages. Why haven't they been banned?\[[edit](https://doomwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Doom_Wiki:FAQ&action=edit&section=22 "Edit section: A user is making confusing edits, or posting nonsense on talk pages. Why haven't they been banned?")\]

Unlike other gaming sites, banning is a last resort on the Doom Wiki.

If someone is posting Viagra links or replacing articles with defamatory or juvenile language, by all means contact an [administrator](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Doom_Wiki:Administrators "Doom Wiki:Administrators") right away. Otherwise, try asking the other user (without shouting) why he/she is editing that way. Look at their [contribution history](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Special:Contributions "Special:Contributions") to see if every edit is confusing, or just certain edits. If the article topic is unfamiliar to you, do some research to learn more about it. And if you've done all that and you still believe there is an issue, get an outside opinion by posting to the article's talk page, or to [Central Processing](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Doom_Wiki:Central_Processing "Doom Wiki:Central Processing") if many pages are involved.

### Someone reverted my edit. I want to put it right back. Should I?\[[edit](https://doomwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Doom_Wiki:FAQ&action=edit&section=23 "Edit section: Someone reverted my edit. I want to put it right back. Should I?")\]

In most cases, no. This is called [edit warring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_warring "wikipedia:Wikipedia:Edit warring"), and we are on the whole particularly intolerant of it. The proper thing to do is to bring up your objection on the article's corresponding Talk page and determine if the other user has a valid reason for reverting your changes. While Wikipedia follows a so-called _three-revert rule_, we prefer for discussion to be opened immediately rather than for repeated reverting to occur, except in the most obvious cases of trolling or other bad behavior. Such instances should be reported directly to an administrator, or discussed on Central Processing if the issue escalates.

Other Doom wikis\[[edit](https://doomwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Doom_Wiki:FAQ&action=edit&section=24 "Edit section: Other Doom wikis")\]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Did the Doom Wiki change webhosts?\[[edit](https://doomwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Doom_Wiki:FAQ&action=edit&section=25 "Edit section: Did the Doom Wiki change webhosts?")\]

[Yes.](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Doom_Wiki:Departure_from_Wikia "Doom Wiki:Departure from Wikia") Technically there are now two wikis called "Doom Wiki", although this one seems to be endorsed by the bulk of the community. The "other" site is run by [Wikia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikia "wikipedia:Wikia"), a corporation which focuses on exploitation of user-created content in order to generate ad revenue.

If you are upset about what happened, you've got lots of company — but please try to forget about the old site. Put your energy into making great articles on DoomWiki.org. You can help us gain notability and search engine ranking on the web by referring to us as the "Doom Wiki at DoomWiki.org", and always linking to it in preference to the defunct older wiki.

If you formerly edited the old site and want the same username here, [check that it still exists](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Special:Contributions "Special:Contributions"), then follow [these instructions](https://www.doomworld.com/vb/post/978448).

### That other wiki is missing a lot of stuff from this one. I'm going to copy it over!\[[edit](https://doomwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Doom_Wiki:FAQ&action=edit&section=26 "Edit section: That other wiki is missing a lot of stuff from this one. I'm going to copy it over!")\]

Additionally, the administrators of that site have decided not to cooperate with the community of free and open wikis or the spirit of the CC BY-SA by forbidding editors from linking to or mentioning our site, as is required under the terms of the license if and when they make use of our content.

Please additionally consider that reducing the uniqueness of the content on our site hurts our presence on the web and damages our ability to maintain a healthy wiki ecosystem.

**Please note:** Any content plagiarized from this site to such a non-compliant wiki may be pursued legally by the content's authors. The contributors to DoomWiki.org reserve the right to send cease-and-desist and/or [DMCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMCA "wikipedia:DMCA") notices if necessary in order to protect the identity and integrity of their works.

### There's an awesome article on that site that you're missing. Can I copy it here?\[[edit](https://doomwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Doom_Wiki:FAQ&action=edit&section=27 "Edit section: There's an awesome article on that site that you're missing. Can I copy it here?")\]

Technically and legally, yes, but we would much prefer if you did not, and instead either:

* Write an original article on the subject yourself, or
* Bring it to the attention of someone you think would enjoy and be able to do that.

Since any links carried here to that site will not be reciprocated, we do not want to have to attribute material to that site, naturally, if it can be avoided.

### I want to work on both sites at the same time. Can I do that?\[[edit](https://doomwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Doom_Wiki:FAQ&action=edit&section=28 "Edit section: I want to work on both sites at the same time. Can I do that?")\]

Yes, so far as any content goes that you yourself wrote. You own the copyright to your own original works, and choose to license them as you see fit. When contributing here, you license your work to this site under the terms of the CC BY-SA 4.0 International. This does not, however, extend to content contributed by other editors. You must get each of those editors' individual permissions in order to use their content under any license other than the one stated, or a newer version of the CC BY-SA as is allowed under its terms.

### I have a question that's not answered here, and I don't want to edit the article until I get feedback.\[[edit](https://doomwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Doom_Wiki:FAQ&action=edit&section=30 "Edit section: I have a question that's not answered here, and I don't want to edit the article until I get feedback.")\]

If you've already tried the article's talk page and gotten no replies for several days, just start editing. (The [revision history](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:MediaWiki_feature_list "mw:Manual:MediaWiki feature list") feature makes it almost impossible to seriously break anything.) If you're new to the site and you're certain that you're in a controversial area, look at the [policies and guidelines](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Doom_Wiki:Policies_and_guidelines "Doom Wiki:Policies and guidelines") to see if the same issue has come up before. You might also post to the personal talk pages of editors who have previously worked on the article.

### I have a question that's not answered here, and it's a general question, or it applies to a group of articles.\[[edit](https://doomwiki.org/w/index.php?title=Doom_Wiki:FAQ&action=edit&section=31 "Edit section: I have a question that's not answered here, and it's a general question, or it applies to a group of articles.")\]

Try reading the [policies and guidelines](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Doom_Wiki:Policies_and_guidelines "Doom Wiki:Policies and guidelines") to see if the same issue has come up before. If that fails, start a thread on [Central Processing](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Doom_Wiki:Central_Processing "Doom Wiki:Central Processing"). Central Processing is one of our high-traffic areas, so if no one responds for a week, you are probably asking a brand new question! The answer will need to arise empirically over time, through further editing and expansion of the relevant topic areas.
