Ebay Billing Agreement
======================

Ebay Billing Agreement

Last updated on 8 March 2007

1\. PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
-----------------------------

This eBay Billing Agreement ("Billing Agreement") is between PayPal, Inc., PayPal CA Limited, and PayPal Pte. Ltd. (collectively "PayPal"), eBay Inc. ("eBay") and you.

2\. AUTHORIZATION TO CHARGE YOUR PAYPAL ACCOUNT FOR EBAY FEES
-------------------------------------------------------------

By agreeing to these terms, you are giving eBay permission to charge your PayPal account on a one-time, sporadic, or recurring basis to collect fees that you owe eBay, unless and until you cancel your Billing Agreement. You authorize PayPal to pay from your PayPal account the full amount of fees presented by eBay. PayPal will not initiate payments on its own under this Billing Agreement; it will only pay out charges initiated by eBay. eBay will present you with an invoice at least 10 days in advance of charging your PayPal account.

PayPal will become your payment method on file with eBay for automatic payment of your eBay selling fees. If you previously had another payment method on file for automatic payment of fees, PayPal will replace that method.

If you change the website of registration of your eBay account (for example, you change registration from eBay.com to eBay.ca), this Billing Agreement will be cancelled. If you change the currency of your eBay account, you will need to again specify PayPal as your automatic payment method for your account in the new currency. If this Billing Agreement is cancelled, or if the payment of your eBay fees through PayPal cannot be completed for any reason, you remain obligated to pay eBay for all unpaid fees, and eBay may charge a payment method previously on file with eBay for payment of your selling fees, such as a credit card or checking account.

3\. FUNDING SOURCE USE
----------------------

When eBay charges your PayPal account, PayPal will always attempt to withdraw funds from your PayPal balance first. If funds in your balance are insufficient, PayPal will look for and attempt to charge a Preferred Funding Source that you have set up for this Billing Agreement. If the Preferred Funding Source fails (for example, a credit card expires), then PayPal will use other available funding sources within your PayPal account. You will have the ability to disable funding sources for use with this Billing Agreement, with the exception that if you have one or more credit or debit cards linked to your PayPal account, then at least one of those cards must be enabled for billing.

You will be able to select or deselect a Preferred Funding Source, and to enable or disable other funding sources, both within the enrollment flow, and at any time through the Direct Payments link under the Account Profile tab when you log in to the PayPal website.
