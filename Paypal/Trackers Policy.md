Last updated on November 7, 2022

**This page is designed to help you** learn more about our use of cookie and tracking technologies. This policy applies to any PayPal service that is linked to this Statement or incorporates it by reference. **When you visit or interact with our sites, services, applications, tools or messages, we or our authorized service providers and third parties may use cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies**.

What are cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies?
--------------------------------------------------------

**Cookies** – Are small text files (typically made up of letters and numbers) placed in the memory of your browser or device when you visit a website or view a message. Cookies allow a website to recognize a particular device or browser. There are several types of cookies:

* Session cookies expire at the end of your browser session and allow us to link your actions during that browser session. They remain on your device only for the duration of the browser session.
* Persistent cookies are stored on your device in between browser sessions, allowing us to remember your preferences or actions across multiple sites. They remain on your device for a longer period.
* First-party cookies are set by the site you are visiting.
* Third-party cookies are set by third-party sites separate from the site you are visiting.

**Web beacons** – Small graphic images (also known as “pixel tags” or “clear GIFs”) that may be included on our sites, services, applications, messaging, and tools, that typically work in conjunction with cookies to identify our users and user behavior.

**Similar technologies** – Technologies that store information in your browser or device utilizing local shared objects or local storage and other web application software methods. These technologies can operate across all of your browsers, and in some instances may not be fully managed by your browser and may require management directly through your installed applications or device. We do not use these technologies for storing information to target advertising to you on or off our sites.

We may use the terms “cookies” or “similar technologies” interchangeably in our policies to refer to all technologies that we may use to store data in your browser or device or that collect information or help us identify you in the manner described above.

What information do cookies collect when you access our services?

Use of these technologies by authorized service providers
---------------------------------------------------------

We may work with third-party companies, commonly known as service providers, who are authorized to place third-party cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies for storing information on our sites or in our services, applications, and tools. These service providers help us to provide you with a better, faster, and safer experience.

These service providers may use these technologies to help us deliver our own content and advertising, and compile site metrics and analytics. We do not permit any of these service providers to collect any of your personal information on our sites or in our services, applications, or tools for their own purposes. These service providers are subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other legal restrictions on their use or collection of any personal information.

With the exception of the use of such technologies by our service providers or other authorized third parties, we do not permit any third-party content on sites. If you believe a listing or other third-party content might be collecting personal information or using tracking technologies on one of our sites, please report it to [phishing@paypal.com](mailto:phishing@paypal.com).

Ad networks and exchanges operated by authorized third parties for interest-based advertising
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We may use third parties, such as advertising networks and exchanges, to allow us to serve you advertisements. These third-party ad networks and exchange providers may use third-party cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies to collect information about your visit to our site and elsewhere on the Internet. They may also collect your device identifier, IP address, or identifier for advertising. The information that these third parties collect may be used to provide you with more relevant advertising on our sites or elsewhere on the web. Third party cookies are covered by the third parties’ privacy policies.

“Do Not Track”
--------------

California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser Do Not Track (DNT) signals. Because there currently isn't an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we don't respond to them currently. We await the result of work by the privacy community and industry to determine when such a response is appropriate and what form it should take.
