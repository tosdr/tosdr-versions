Privacy Notice
==============

Effective Date: Feb 23, 2024

#### Data Controller Contact Information

Enpass Technologies Inc.

Suite 111, Wilmington

Enpass Technologies Inc and its business partners believe in high standards when protecting information provided by our users and customers. This privacy notice applies to the information that we collect from you when you use our Platform, [https://www.enpass.io](https://www.enpass.io/), [https://discussion.enpass.io](https://discussion.enpass.io/), and our software for mobiles and desktops applications, collectively and herein after called “Platform.”

Our privacy notice tells you what personal data and nonpersonal data we may collect from you, how we collect them, how we protect them, how we disclose them, how you can access and change them, and how you can limit our disclosing of them. Our privacy notice also explains certain legal rights that you have with respect to your personal data.

#### Definitions

‘NONPERSONAL DATA’ (NPD) means any information that is in no way personally identifiable.

‘PERSONAL DATA’ (PD) means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person can be identified directly or indirectly by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that natural person. PD is in many ways the same as Personally Identifiable Information (PII). However, PD is broader in scope and covers more data.  
**Even though the definition of personal data is broad, we only collect your first name, last name and email address. For Enpass Business users, using Enpass-hosted Hub, we store additional data on our servers. All your secured data like logins, credit cards or any kind of data that you store in our Platform is stored locally and is never sent to our servers encrypted or unencrypted.**

“MASTER PASSWORD” is a secret word or phrase in combination with any key that is mandatory to gain access to the Secured Data stored in our Platform.

**Note:** We never ask for your master password or any other secured data.

Some web browsers have settings that enable you to request that our Platform not track your movement within our Platform. Our Platform does not obey such settings when transmitted to and detected by our Platform. You can turn off tracking features and other security settings in your browser by referring to your browser’s user manual.

### LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES

If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child is using our Platform and they are under the age of 16, please contact us.

If we discover that a child under the age of 16 is accessing our Platform, we will delete their information within a reasonable period of time. You acknowledge that we do not verify the age of our users nor have any liability to do so.

### OUR EMAIL POLICY

You can always opt-out of receiving email correspondence from us or our affiliates. We will not sell, rent, or trade your email address to any unaffiliated third-party without your permission except in the sale or transfer of our company, or if our company files for bankruptcy as described in the section **Disclosures to Successors**.

### OUR SECURITY POLICY

We have built our Platform using industry-standard security measures and authentication tools and user services like Amazon Web Services (AWS) to protect the security of your PD. We and the third parties who provide services to us also maintain technical and physical safeguards to protect your PD. Unfortunately we cannot guarantee prevention of loss or misuse of your PD or secure data transmission over the Internet because of its nature. We strongly urge you to protect any password you may have for our Platform and not share it with anyone.

### USE OF YOUR CREDIT CARD

You may have to provide a credit or debit card to buy products and services from our Platform. We use third-party billing services and have no control over them. We use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that your credit card number is kept strictly confidential by using only third-party billing services that use industry-standard encryption technology to protect your credit card number from unauthorized use. However, you understand and agree that we are in no way responsible for any misuse of your credit card number.

### TRANSFERRING PD FROM OTHER COUNTRIES

PD that we collect from you may be stored, processed, and transferred among any countries in which we operate. The European Union has not found the United States and some other countries to have an acceptable level of protection of PD under Article 45 of the GDPR. Our company relies on derogations for specific situations as defined in Article 49 of the GDPR. If you are a European Union user, or a user from another country, with your consent your PD may be transferred to the United States or other countries when you request information from us. When you buy goods or services, we will use your PD to perform a contract with you. Wherever we transfer, process, or store your PD, we will try to apply reasonable safeguards to protect it. We will use the information we collect from you by following the practices described in our privacy notice. Also, we enter into data processing agreements and standard contractual clauses when appropriate. By using our Platform, services, or products, you agree to the transfers of your PD described within this section.

### CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY NOTICE

We reserve the right to change this privacy notice at any time. If our company decides to change this privacy notice, we will post those changes on our Platform so our users and customers are always aware of what information we collect, use, and disclose. If at any time we decide to disclose or use your PD in a method different from that specified at the time it was collected, we will provide advance notice by email sent to the email address on file in your account. Otherwise, we will use and disclose our users’ and customers’ PD in agreement with this privacy notice in effect when the information was collected. Your continued use of our Platform, services, and products after any change to this privacy notice will constitute your acceptance of such change. If you have questions about our privacy notice, please contact us through the information at the top of this privacy notice.
