Information Collected Automatically
-----------------------------------

The Services use cookies and similar technologies such as pixel tags, web beacons, clear GIFs and JavaScript (collectively, "Cookies") to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you visit and use our Services, to analyze trends, learn about our user base and operate and improve our Services. Cookies are small pieces of data – usually text files – placed on your computer, tablet, phone or similar device when you use that device to use our Services. We may also supplement the information that we collect from you with information received from Third Parties, including Third Parties that have placed their own Cookies on your device(s). Please note that because of our use of Cookies, the Services do not support "Do Not Track" requests sent from a browser at this time.

We use the following types of Cookies:

* Essential Cookies. Essential Cookies are required for providing you with features or services that you have requested. For example, certain Cookies enable you to log into secure areas of our Services. Disabling these Cookies may make certain features and services unavailable.
* Functional Cookies. Functional Cookies are used to record your choices and settings regarding our Services, maintain your preferences over time and recognize you when you return to our Services. These Cookies help us to personalize our content for you, greet you by name and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region). We also use these Cookies to help track items (including abandoned items) in your shopping cart so we can determine when to send cart reminder messages via SMS.
* Performance/Analytical Cookies. Performance/Analytical Cookies allow us to understand how visitors use our Services, such as by collecting information about the number of visitors to the Services, what pages visitors view on our Services, what actions a visitor performs on our Services and how long visitors are viewing pages on the Services. Performance/Analytical Cookies also help us measure the performance of our advertising campaigns in order to help us improve our campaigns and the Services' content for those who engage with our advertising. For example, Google, Inc. ("Google") uses cookies in connection with its Google Analytics services. Google's ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Services is subject to the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy. You have the option to opt out of Google's use of Cookies by visiting the [Google advertising opt-out page](https://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html) or the [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/).
* Retargeting/Advertising Cookies. Retargeting/Advertising Cookies collect data about your online activity and identify your interests so that we can provide advertising that we believe is relevant to you. For more information about this, please see the section below titled ["Information about Interest-Based Advertisements."](https://lumedeodorant.com/privacy-policy#pp-info-internet-based-advertisements)

You can decide whether or not to accept Cookies through your internet browser's settings. Most browsers have an option for turning off the Cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new Cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allow you to decide on acceptance of each new Cookie in a variety of ways. You can also delete all Cookies that are already on your device. If you do this, however, you may have to manually adjust some preferences every time you visit our website and some of the Services and functionalities may not work.

To explore what Cookie settings are available to you, look in the "preferences" or "options" section of your browser's menu. To find out more information about Cookies, including information about how to manage and delete Cookies, please visit [http://www.allaboutcookies.org/](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

Further, as described below under the ["California Resident Rights under the CCPA"](https://lumedeodorant.com/privacy-policy#pp-california-resident-rights-under-the-ccpa) and ["Other State Law Privacy Rights"](https://lumedeodorant.com/privacy-policy#pp-other-state-law-privacy-rights) sections, to the extent these Cookies are deemed to be a "sale" or "sharing" (which includes targeted advertising) under applicable U.S. state laws, you can opt-out of these Cookies by following the instructions set out in these sections. Please note, some features of our websites may not be available to you as a result. In addition, if you were to delete or reset your Cookies, switch browsers or change your browser settings, or access our Services from a different device, you may need to opt out of such Cookies again by following the relevant instructions below.

  
Information about Interest-Based Advertisements
--------------------------------------------------

We serve advertisements, and also allow third-party ad networks, including third-party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms, to serve advertisements through the Services. These advertisements may be targeted to users who fit certain general profile categories or display certain preferences or behaviors ("Interest-Based Ads"). Information for Interest-Based Ads (including Personal Data) may be provided to us by you, or derived from the usage patterns of particular users on the Services and/or services of Third Parties. Such information may be gathered through tracking users' activities across time and unaffiliated properties, including when you leave the Services. To accomplish this, we or our service providers may deliver Cookies, including a file (known as a "web beacon") from an ad network to you through the Services. Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Web beacons allow ad networks to view, edit or set their own Cookies on your browser, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.

We comply with the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising. Through the DAA and Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"), several media and marketing associations have developed an industry self-regulatory program to give consumers a better understanding of, and greater control over, ads that are customized based on a consumer's online behavior across different websites and properties. To make choices about Interest-Based Ads from participating third parties, including to opt out of receiving behaviorally targeted advertisements from participating organizations, please visit the [DAA's](http://www.aboutads.info/choices) or [NAI's](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) consumer opt-out pages.  
  

How We Use Your Personal Data
-----------------------------

We process Personal Data to operate, improve, understand and personalize our Services. We use Personal Data for the following purposes:

* To meet or fulfill the reason you provided the information to us
* To communicate with you about the Services, including Service announcements, updates or offers
* To provide support and assistance for the Services
* To create and manage your Account with us, to the extent Account registration is available, or other user profiles

We will not collect additional categories of Personal Data or use the Personal Data we collected for materially different, unrelated or incompatible purposes without providing you notice.

As noted in the list above, we may communicate with you if you've provided us the means to do so. For example, if you choose to send us Personal Data by sending us an email, completing a survey or contacting our customer service department, we will keep a record of that communication and may collect and use Personal Data that you provide to us in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If we communicate with you via email, SMS, MMS or other text message ("Text Message"), we may collect information regarding such communications, such as confirmation when you open an email or read a Text Message. We use this information for purposes such as to operate and improve our Services, including our customer service, or as otherwise permitted by this Privacy Policy. If you opt to have promotional offers from us sent to your mobile device, we may send you Text Messages regarding such promotional offers to the telephone number you provided to us. To opt out of receiving promotional Text Messages from us, reply "STOP" to any such message.

  
How We Disclose Your Personal Data
-------------------------------------

### _Disclosures of Personal Data for a Business Purpose_

In this section, we use the terms "sell" and "sharing" as they are defined in the CCPA. We sell or share (for cross-context behavioral advertising) your Personal Data, subject to your right to opt out of these sales or sharing (see the "Exercising Your Rights" section below for information about how to opt out).

As described above, we have incorporated Cookies from certain third parties into our Services. These Cookies allow those third parties to receive information about your activity on our Services that is associated with your browser or device. Those third parties may use that data to serve you relevant ads on our Services or on other websites you visit. Under the CCPA, sharing your data through third party Cookies for online advertising may be considered a "sale" of information. You can opt out of these sales by following the instructions in this policy.

We sell or share your Personal Data to the following categories of third parties:

* Data Cooperatives:
    * We may share your name and shipping address, along with certain information regarding your transactions with us (including transaction date, value, amount, type and order ID) with providers of data cooperative and marketing services that serve members-only groups of retailers (such services, "Data Cooperatives", and such members, the "Data Cooperative Members"). Through the Data Cooperatives, lists of prospective customers are shared with their respective Data Cooperative Members. No individual transactional information is shared with Data Cooperative Members. We may engage Data Cooperatives for the commercial purpose of better marketing to existing and prospective customers. More specifically, we may share this information with Data Cooperatives so that they can analyze your buying patterns and determine what sort of products are likely to appeal to you, and Data Cooperatives share your name and shipping address with Data Cooperative Members who may offer such products.
    * You may receive information and materials regarding products offered by Data Cooperative Members. The list of retailers in such Data Cooperatives changes frequently, but includes retailers in the clothing, collectables, food and wine, gardening, gadgets and entertainment, health and beauty, household goods and/or home interiors categories. You agree to the sharing of the above-described information with Data Cooperatives and Data Cooperative Members and to be eligible to receive such materials if and when you register an account with us.
    * If you decide you would like us to stop sharing this information and receiving materials, you can email us at [\[email protected\]](https://lumedeodorant.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

The above excludes text messaging originator opt-in data and consent information, which will not be sold to third parties.

  
Data Security and Retention
------------------------------

We seek to protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, use and disclosure using appropriate physical, technical, organizational and administrative security measures based on the type of Personal Data and how we are processing that data. For example, all credit card information and shipping information regularly collected through the Services is encrypted and maintained using industry standard methods designed to ensure its security against loss or theft, including during transmission to one or more third-party Payment Processors. Your financial information, such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information) is used and stored by our Payment Processor, which is currently Stripe, and use and storage of that information by the Payment Processor is governed by the Payment Processor's applicable [terms of service](https://stripe.com/us/legal) and [privacy policy](https://stripe.com/us/privacy). To the extent you are able to and have an Account, you should also help protect your data by appropriately selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism, limiting access to your computer or device and browser, and signing off after you have finished accessing your account. Although we work to protect the security of your Account and other data that we hold in our records, please be aware that no method of transmitting data over the Internet or storing data is completely secure. We cannot guarantee the complete security of any data you share with us, and except as expressly required by law, we are not responsible for the theft, destruction, loss or inadvertent disclosure of your information or content.

We retain Personal Data about you for as long as you have an open account with us or as otherwise necessary to provide you with our Services. In some cases, we retain Personal Data for longer, if doing so is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or collect fees owed, or is otherwise permitted or required by applicable law, rule or regulation. We may further retain information in an anonymous or aggregated form where that information would not identify you personally.

  
Personal Data of Children
----------------------------

As noted in the Terms of Service, we do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Data from individuals under 18 years of age, and we do not allow individuals under 18 years of age to use the Services without the consent of their respective parents or legal guardians; if you are an individual under the age of 18, please do not attempt to register for or otherwise use the Services or send us any Personal Data without the consent of your parent or legal guardian. If we learn that we have collected Personal Data from a child under 16 years of age, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 16 years of age may have provided us with Personal Data, please contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://lumedeodorant.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

  
California Resident Rights Under the CCPA

* The categories of sources from which that Personal Data was collected

* The categories of third parties with whom we have shared your Personal Data

The categories of sources from which we collect Personal Data and our business and commercial purposes for using and disclosing Personal Data are set forth in ["Categories of Personal Data that We Collect"](https://lumedeodorant.com/privacy-policy#pp-categories-personal-data), ["How We Use Your Personal Data"](https://lumedeodorant.com/privacy-policy#pp-how-we-use-your-personal-data), and ["How We Disclose Your Personal Data"](https://lumedeodorant.com/privacy-policy#pp-how-we-disclose-your-personal-data) above, respectively.

### 4\. Exercising Your Rights

To exercise the rights described above, you must send us a request that (1) provides sufficient information to allow us to verify that you are the person about whom we have collected Personal Data and (2) describes your request in sufficient detail to allow us to understand, evaluate and respond to it. Each request that meets both of these criteria will be considered a "Valid Request." We may not respond to requests that do not meet these criteria. We will only use Personal Data provided in a Valid Request to verify your identity and complete your request. You do not need an Account to submit a Valid Request.

We will work to respond to your Valid Request within 45 days of receipt. We will not charge you a fee for making a Valid Request unless your Valid Request(s) is excessive, repetitive or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that your Valid Request warrants a fee, we will notify you of the fee and explain that decision before completing your request.
