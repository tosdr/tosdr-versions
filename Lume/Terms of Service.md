ORDERING, DELIVERY, PAYMENTS AND BILLING
----------------------------------------

### PAID SERVICES AND TERMS OF SALE

Certain of our Services, including the purchase of any products or subscriptions offered by us, may be subject to payments now or in the future (the "Paid Services"), which in certain cases may include recurring, automatically renewing payment obligations (as further described in the "AUTO-RENEWALS AND RECURRING BILLING FOR SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES" section below). When placing an order for Paid Services, you will see links to descriptions of our shipping terms and applicable cancellation or refund policies. Please note that any payment terms presented to you in the process of using or signing up for a Paid Service are deemed part of these Terms of Service.

You may place an order for Paid Services at any time (subject to any planned or unplanned downtime). You may check and correct any input errors in your order up until the point at which you submit your order to us by clicking the "Pay now" button on the checkout page. An order submitted by you constitutes a legally binding offer given by you to us to purchase the Paid Services specified in that order, subject to these Terms of Service, at the price and on the terms stated when you sign up or place your order. Prices are subject to change at any time. The prices displayed are quoted in U.S. currency and are valid only in the United States. Sales tax will be determined by the shipping address of the order and will automatically be added to the order. All orders are subject to acceptance by us. We reserve the right to limit orders and the Paid Services to exclude any person, geographic region, or jurisdiction or to limit the quantities of any of our products or Paid Services that you may order. Your order will not be considered accepted until we have received payment of the purchase price of your order. We may send an acknowledgment of our receipt of your order to the email address you provide, after your payment for the order has been processed, so that you may print the information for your records. Unless otherwise stated at the time you place your order, title and risk of loss pass to you upon delivery to the shipping address you specified when you placed the order, provided full payment of all sums due in respect of the product(s), including any delivery charges, has been received.

Our products and services, including, without limitation, our Paid Services, are for your personal, non-commercial use, and once delivered to you may not be resold, redistributed, exported or used for any other commercial purpose. The rights you have under these Terms of Service are personal to you and are non-transferable.

Please note that we cannot offer refunds, exchanges or customer service for products that have been acquired from an unauthorized reseller, including, but not limited to, any seller on Amazon, eBay or similar online marketplaces.

### BILLING

We use one or more third-party payment processors (each, a "Payment Processor") to bill you through a payment account on the Services (your "Billing Account") for the Paid Services. To the extent we offer the ability to register for an Account and you are eligible to and elect to register for such Account, your Billing Account may be linked to your Account. The processing of payments will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the applicable Payment Processor in addition to these Terms of Service. Currently, we use Stripe, Inc. as a Payment Processor. You can access Stripe’s Terms of Service at [https://stripe.com/us/checkout/legal](https://stripe.com/us/checkout/legal) and their Privacy Policy at [https://stripe.com/us/privacy](https://stripe.com/us/privacy) . More information is available in our [Privacy Policy](https://lumedeodorant.com/privacy-policy) . We are not responsible for errors by the Payment Processors. By choosing to use Paid Services, you agree to pay us, through the applicable Payment Processor, all charges at the prices then in effect for any use of such Paid Services in accordance with the applicable payment terms and you authorize us, through the applicable Payment Processor, to charge your chosen payment provider (your "Payment Method"). You agree to make payments using that selected Payment Method. We reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes that the applicable Payment Processor makes even if it has already requested or received payment.

### PAYMENT METHOD

The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen Payment Method. If we, through the applicable Payment Processor, do not receive payment from you, you agree to pay all amounts due on your Billing Account upon demand.

### IMPORTANT NOTICE TO CONSUMERS—TO THE EXTENT THAT LUME OFFERS SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES, THE FOLLOWING TERMS WILL APPLY:

### AUTO-RENEWALS AND RECURRING BILLING FOR SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES

Lume may from time to time offer certain Paid Services, such as the purchase of auto-replacing products, which may consist of an initial period for which there is a one-time charge or a Promotional Offer (as defined below), followed by recurring periodic charges as agreed to by you when you sign up for such auto-replacing products ("Subscription Services"). The Subscription Services give you the ability to select how regularly you would like to order any auto-replacing products, including the ability to modify shipping dates. Unless you opt out of a Subscription Service, which can be done via the methods described below, the Subscription Services that you have signed up for will automatically continue at the then-current non-promotional rate. To the extent we offer Subscription Services, we may provide additional information regarding such Subscription Services on an FAQ page. By choosing a Subscription Service, you acknowledge that such Subscription Service has an initial and recurring payment feature, and you accept responsibility for all recurring charges prior to the effective date of cancellation of such Subscription Service. All recurring payments relating to Subscription Services are fully earned upon payment.

To change or cancel your Subscription Services at any time, go to your Account (if applicable) or email us at [\[email protected\]](https://lumedeodorant.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). If you terminate a Subscription Service, the relevant subscription will not be renewed after your then-current subscription term expires.

WE MAY SUBMIT PERIODIC CHARGES (E.G., MONTHLY) WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM YOU, UNTIL YOU PROVIDE PRIOR NOTICE (RECEIPT OF WHICH IS CONFIRMED BY US) THAT YOU HAVE TERMINATED THIS AUTHORIZATION OR WISH TO CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD. SUCH NOTICE WILL NOT AFFECT CHARGES SUBMITTED BEFORE WE REASONABLY COULD ACT. TO TERMINATE YOUR AUTHORIZATION, OR TO CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD OR SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES, GO TO YOUR ACCOUNT (IF APPLICABLE) OR CONTACT US AT THE EMAIL ADDRESS LISTED ABOVE.

### CURRENT INFORMATION REQUIRED

In the event you have signed up for the Subscription Services, you must provide current, complete and accurate information for your Billing Account. You must promptly update all information to keep your Billing Account current, complete and accurate (such as a change in billing address, credit card number or credit card expiration date), and you must promptly notify us or the applicable Payment Processor if your Payment Method is canceled (e.g., for loss or theft) or if you become aware of a potential breach of security, such as the unauthorized disclosure or use of your user name or password. Changes to such information can be made on your [Account](http://www.harrys.com/profile). IF YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE ANY OF THE FOREGOING INFORMATION, YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY CONTINUE CHARGING YOU FOR ANY USE OF PAID SERVICES UNDER YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT UNLESS YOU HAVE TERMINATED YOUR PAID SERVICES AS SET FORTH ABOVE.

### CHANGE IN AMOUNT AUTHORIZED

If the amount to be charged to your Billing Account varies from the amount you preauthorized (other than due to the imposition or change in the amount of state sales taxes), you have the right to receive, and we shall provide, notice of the amount to be charged and the date of the charge before the scheduled date of the transaction. If, on receipt of such notice, you do not wish to continue with the purchase, you may cancel at any time before the scheduled date of the transaction. Any agreement you have with your payment provider will govern your use of your Payment Method. You agree that we may accumulate charges incurred and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each billing cycle.

### REAFFIRMATION OF AUTHORIZATION

Your non-termination or continued use of a Paid Service (including, without limitation, Subscription Services) reaffirms that we are authorized to charge your Payment Method for that Paid Service. We may submit those charges for payment and you will be responsible for such charges. This does not waive our right to seek payment directly from you. Your charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage or as otherwise described when you initially selected to use the Paid Service.

### TRIALS AND OTHER PROMOTIONS

To the extent we provide any trial or other promotion that provides access to a Paid Service (a "Promotional Offer"), it must be used within the specified time of the Promotional Offer. You will be required to have a valid Payment Method on file in order to initiate a Promotional Offer. You must stop using a Paid Service before the end of the Promotional Offer period in order to avoid being charged the full amount for that Paid Service. If you cancel prior to the end of the Promotional Offer period and are inadvertently charged for a Paid Service, please contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://lumedeodorant.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). Promotional Offers are one-time only for new customers and are limited to one per household. Additional terms and limitations may apply and will be more fully explained at the time you sign up for the Promotional Offer. Any such additional terms and limitations are deemed part of these Terms of Service.

### TERMINATION

We may terminate your access to all or any part of the Services at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately, which, if you have registered an Account with the Services, may result in the forfeiture and destruction of all information associated with your Account. If you have registered but wish to terminate your Account, you may do so by using our "Contact Us" form to send us an Account termination request. Any fees paid hereunder are non-refundable. All provisions of these Terms of Service which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity provisions and limitations of liability.  
  

WARRANTY DISCLAIMER AND RELEASE
-------------------------------

We have no special relationship with or fiduciary duty to you and no information or recommendation provided to you through the Services should be used as a substitute for consultation with a qualified medical professional or other expert. You acknowledge that we have no duty to take any action regarding which users gain access to the Services, or how you may interpret or use the Content. You release us and our officers, directors and employees from all liability arising out of or relating to your having acquired or not acquired Content through the Services. We make no representations concerning any Content contained in or accessed through the Services, and we will not be responsible or liable for the accuracy (including, without limitation, of any Content described on the Site or through the Services as "educational"), copyright compliance or legality of material or Content contained in or accessed through the Services. It is your sole responsibility to ensure that our products and Services are sufficient and suitable for your individual purposes.

You shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542 or any other similar law of any jurisdiction, which says in substance: "A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE SERVICES AND CONTENT ARE PROVIDED "AS IS", "AS AVAILABLE" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND ANY WARRANTIES IMPLIED BY ANY COURSE OF PERFORMANCE OR USAGE OF TRADE, ALL OF WHICH ARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, WE AND OUR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS, PARTNERS AND CONTENT PROVIDERS DO NOT WARRANT THAT: (I) THE SERVICES WILL BE SECURE OR AVAILABLE AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME OR LOCATION; (II) ANY DEFECTS OR ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED; (III) ANY CONTENT OR SOFTWARE AVAILABLE AT OR THROUGH THE SERVICES IS FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS; OR (IV) THE RESULTS OF USING THE SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR EXPECTATIONS. YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES IS SOLELY AT YOUR OWN RISK. SOME JURISDICTIONS LIMIT OR DO NOT ALLOW THE DISCLAIMER OF IMPLIED OR OTHER WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

### INDEMNIFICATION

You shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless us and our employees, contractors, directors, officers, suppliers and representatives from all liabilities, claims and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, that arise from or relate to your use or misuse of, or access to, the Services or Content in violation of these Terms of Service, or infringement by you, or any third party using your Account (if applicable) or identity in the Services, of any intellectual property or other right of any person or entity. We reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will assist and cooperate with us in asserting any available defenses.

### LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL WE OR OUR DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, PARTNERS, SUPPLIERS OR CONTENT PROVIDERS BE LIABLE UNDER CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, NEGLIGENCE OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES (I) FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, DATA LOSS, COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, COMPENSATORY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER (HOWEVER ARISING), (II) FOR ANY BUGS, VIRUSES, TROJAN HORSES OR THE LIKE (REGARDLESS OF THE SOURCE OF ORIGINATION) OR (III) FOR ANY DIRECT DAMAGES IN EXCESS (IN THE AGGREGATE) OF THE GREATER OF (A) FEES PAID TO US FOR THE PARTICULAR SERVICES DURING THE IMMEDIATELY PREVIOUS THREE (3) MONTH PERIOD AND (B) $100.00. THESE LIMITATIONS WILL ONLY APPLY TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AND DO NOT APPLY TO DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM OUR ACTS OR OMISSIONS OR TO LIABILITY RESULTING FROM OUR GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT.

### DISPUTES

### ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER – IMPORTANT – PLEASE REVIEW AS THIS AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS

Arbitration; Waiver of Trial by Jury. YOU AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US OR ANY OF OUR OFFICERS, DIRECTORS OR EMPLOYEES ACTING IN THEIR CAPACITY AS SUCH (WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DISPUTE INVOLVES A THIRD PARTY) WITH REGARD TO YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH US, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DISPUTES RELATED TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES AND/OR RIGHTS OF PRIVACY AND/OR PUBLICITY, WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION UNDER THE JAMS, INC. ("JAMS") RULES FOR ARBITRATION OF CONSUMER-RELATED DISPUTES, AND YOU AND WE HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT WE OR YOU MAY SEEK INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF IN ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT HAVING JURISDICTION TO GRANT IT IN THE EVENT OF AN ACTUAL OR THREATENED INFRINGEMENT OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. DISCOVERY AND RIGHTS TO APPEAL IN ARBITRATION ARE GENERALLY MORE LIMITED THAN IN A LAWSUIT, AND OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU AND WE WOULD HAVE IN COURT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.

Small Claims Court; Class Action Waiver. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local "small claims" court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules and if such claim is within such court’s jurisdiction, unless such action is transferred, removed or appealed to a different court. You may bring claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor we will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement. YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS MEMBER ON ANY CLASS CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST US, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY RIGHT TO CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY CONSOLIDATION OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person’s account, if we are a party to the proceeding.

Procedures. These dispute resolution provisions will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and not by any state law concerning arbitration. In the event that JAMS is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either we or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the American Arbitration Association. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Service. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of, related to or connected with the use of the Services or these Terms of Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever banned.

30-Day Opt-Out Period. If you do not wish to be bound by the arbitration and class-action waiver provisions in this Disputes section, you must notify us in writing within thirty (30) days of the date that you first accept these Terms of Service (unless a longer period is required by applicable law), and then you must litigate any disputes against us in accordance with the "Governing Law and Jurisdiction" section below. Your written notification must be mailed to us at the address set out at the end of these Terms of Service. If you do not notify us in accordance with this paragraph, you agree to be bound by the terms of this Disputes section, including, without limitation, the arbitration and class-action waiver provisions, and further including such provisions in any revisions we make to these Terms of Service after the date of your first acceptance. Such notification must include: (i) your name; (ii) your email address and mailing address; and (iii) a statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with us through arbitration or waive your ability to participate in a class action. If we make any changes to this Disputes section (other than a change to the address at which we will receive notices or rejections of future changes to this Disputes section), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice, within thirty (30) days of the change, to the address set out at the end of these Terms of Service. It is not necessary to send us a rejection of a future change to this Disputes section if you had properly opted out within the first thirty (30) days after you first accepted the provisions in this Disputes section. If you have not properly opted out, then by rejecting a future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Disputes section, as modified by any changes you did not reject. A notification sent pursuant to this paragraph solely affects these Terms of Service; if you previously entered into other arbitration or dispute resolution agreements with us or enter into other such agreements in the future, your notification that you are opting out of the provisions in this Disputes section shall not affect the other arbitration agreements between you and us.

Severability. If any of the prohibitions against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Disputes section will be null and void. This Disputes section, including, without limitation, the arbitration agreement and class action waivers contained herein, will survive the termination of your relationship with us.

### GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION

Subject to the Disputes section above, these Terms of Service shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, including its conflicts of law rules, and the laws of the United States of America. Subject to the Disputes section above, you agree that any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of these Terms of Service shall be governed by the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts of New York County, New York.

### MODIFICATION

We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify or replace any of these Terms of Service, or change, suspend or discontinue the Services, in whole or in part, (including, without limitation, the availability of any feature, database or content) at any time by posting a notice on the Site or by sending you notice through the Services, via e-mail or by another appropriate means of electronic communication. We may also impose limits on certain features and services or restrict your access to parts or all of the Services without notice or liability. While we will use commercially reasonable efforts to timely provide notice of modifications, it is also your responsibility to check these Terms of Service periodically for changes. Subject to the Disputes section, your continued use of the Services following notification of any changes to these Terms of Service constitutes acceptance of those changes.  
  

MISCELLANEOUS
-------------

### ENTIRE AGREEMENT AND SEVERABILITY

These Terms of Service are the entire agreement between you and us with respect to the Services, including use of the Site, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written or electronic) between you and us with respect to the Services. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms of Service will otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder.

### FORCE MAJEURE

We shall not be liable for any failure to perform our obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond our reasonable control, including, without limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation.

### ASSIGNMENT

These Terms of Service are personal to you, and are not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with our prior written consent. We may assign, transfer or delegate any of our rights and obligations hereunder without consent.

### COUPON CODES

Coupon codes have no cash value and cannot be redeemable for cash, and cannot be combined with any other offers. Limit one coupon code per order. Coupon codes generally expire and are no longer valid for redemption 30 days after their date of generation, but certain coupon codes may have their own redemption period as specified in connection with the coupon code itself. The unauthorized reproduction, resale, modification or trade of coupon codes is prohibited. Coupon codes are void where prohibited, taxed or restricted. Lume reserves the right to change or limit coupon codes in its sole discretion.

No agency, partnership, joint venture or employment relationship is created as a result of these Terms of Service and neither you nor Lume has any authority of any kind to bind the other in any respect.

Electronic notices should be sent to [\[email protected\]](https://lumedeodorant.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

### NO WAIVER

Our failure to enforce any part of these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of our right to later enforce that or any other part of these Terms of Service. Waiver of compliance in any particular instance does not mean that we will waive compliance in the future. In order for any waiver of compliance with these Terms of Service to be binding, we must provide you with written notice of such waiver through one of our authorized representatives.

### HEADINGS; INTERPRETATION

The section and paragraph headings in these Terms of Service are for convenience only and shall not affect their interpretation. Any use of the words "including", "for example" or "such as" in these Terms of Service shall be read as being followed by "without limitation" where appropriate.
