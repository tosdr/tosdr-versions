You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us, have purchased goods or services from us, or if you provided us with your details when you entered a competition or registered for a promotion, and, in each case, you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.

  

#### Opting out

We market our products in a variety of ways. If you opt-in to receive marketing communications from us, we may send you information about new products, services or discounted offerings. You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you these types of marketing messages at any time by logging into the website or app and checking or unchecking relevant boxes to adjust your marketing preferences, by following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you, or by contacting us with a request at any time.

More information about your online activities and exercising choices across websites or services is available at [www.aboutads.info](https://youradchoices.com/) or [www.networkadvertising.org.](https://thenai.org/)

  

#### Change of purpose

We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collect it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason, and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us. If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and, if required, explain our legal basis for and obtain your consent to the new use.

Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, when this is required or permitted by law.

  

### 5\. DISCLOSURE AND SHARING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA

We may disclose or share your personal data to entities other than iFIT for a business purpose. We may disclose or share the categories of personal data listed in Section 2 with the following types of third parties or service providers:

  

#### Internal third parties

Other companies in the iFIT group act as joint controllers or processors, provide IT and system administration services, and undertake leadership reporting. When we share information internally, we require our affiliates and subsidiaries to process your personal information consistent with this Privacy Notice.

  

#### External third parties

* Service providers acting as processors based inside or outside the US who provide IT and system administration services. We require all service providers to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes, and we only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.
* Partners that offer health and fitness services only when you choose to link your account.
* Professional advisers acting as processors or joint controllers, including lawyers, bankers, auditors, and insurers based inside or outside the US who provide consultancy, banking, legal, insurance, and accounting services.
* Regulators and other authorities acting as processors or joint controllers based inside or outside the US who require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances.
* Any other entity when required by law. For example, in response to a court order or subpoena. We may also disclose information in response to requests from law enforcement agencies or other public agencies if we feel that such disclosure may prevent the instigation of a crime.
* Third parties to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy notice.
* Third parties that may provide us with analytics services or deliver advertising that is customized for you based on your interaction with our website, apps and services.

  

### 6\. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS

We share your personal data within the iFIT group. We store the information we collect—including your personal data—in the United States, so if you are accessing an iFIT site from another country, your information is being transferred to and from the United States and specifically outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) or Brazil.

We ensure that your personal data is protected by requiring all of iFIT's companies to follow the same rules when processing your personal data. Moreover, sensitive and private data exchanged between an iFIT site and you occurs over an SSL secured communication channel and is encrypted and protected with digital signatures.

We want you to feel confident using the iFIT sites. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website www.consumer.ftc.gov for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.

Whenever we transfer your personal data, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by using an approved data transfer mechanism, such as Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission, which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.

Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism we use when transferring your personal data in or out of the EEA.

  

### 7\. DATA RETENTION

We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data, whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

By law, we must keep basic information about our customers (including contact, identity, financial, and transaction data) for seven years after they cease being customers, for tax purposes.

In some circumstances, we may anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes—in which case, we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

  

### 8\. YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS

Under certain circumstances, you may have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. In addition to the rights discussed in the opt-out section above, you may have the following rights.

* Request access to your personal data, commonly known as a data subject access request. This enables you to know the personal data we have collected from and about you.
* Request correction of your personal data. This enables you to correct or update any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you, although we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide us.
* Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete your personal data. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data when you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), when we may have processed your information unlawfully, or when we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons, which we will inform you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
* Object to processing of your personal data for certain purposes. You may object to the processing of your personal data when we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) for the processing, and you believe that your rights and freedoms outweigh our legitimate interest. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling, legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms. You also have the right to request that we not use your personal data for direct or targeted marketing.
* Request that we restrict the processing your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) when you believe that our use of the data is unlawful, but you do not want us to erase it; (c) when you need us to hold the data, even if we no longer require it, such as when you need it to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data, but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it. If we are processing sensitive personal data, such as your health data, you may ask that we limit our processing of that data in certain circumstances. Limiting this processing may compromise your access to the full capabilities of our services, such as goal tracking or heart rate monitoring.
* Request transfer of a copy of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party that you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.
* Right to withdraw consent at any time when we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
* Right to Non-Discrimination. You have the right not to be discriminated against for having exercised your privacy rights. We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your privacy rights.
* Right to Opt-Out of the Sale or Sharing. We use digital technologies, like cookies, beacons, Ad IDs, IP addresses and pixels for online advertising and analytics. We may disclose certain online identifiers with our advertising partners and analytics providers. Disclosing these identifiers with third parties for advertising or analytics purposes may be defined as the “sale” or “sharing” of your information under certain state privacy laws. You may have the right to opt-out of these uses. If you opt-out this type of “sale” or “sharing” of your information, we will not deliver customized advertising to you. You may still see non-targeted advertising about our products and services. You may opt-out of the sale or sharing of your information for marketing or analytics by clicking on the ["Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information”](https://www.ifit.com/cookie-policy) link and unselecting marketing and analytics cookies.

If you wish to exercise any of the other rights set out above, you may submit a verifiable consumer request to us either by completing this [form](https://privacyportal-cdn.onetrust.com/dsarwebform/9f2a1fbd-e318-4058-aed9-27aa6caa6db1/97c00c4f-92c4-455e-9652-10a7896b3952.html) or calling us at 1.866.608.1798.

We typically do not charge a fee to exercise these rights. However, we reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive, or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

  

#### What we may need from you

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data or to exercise any of your other rights. This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

You may use an authorized agent to submit your consumer rights requests on your behalf if you provide the authorized agent written permission to do so. We will not act upon a request from an authorized agent if the agent does not submit proof (your written permission) that the agent has been authorized by you to act on your behalf. We will not act upon a request if we believe it is fraudulent.

  

#### Time limit to respond

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally, it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or if you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

  

#### Appeals or Complaints

If we deny your request to exercise a particular consumer right, in certain circumstances, you may have the right to appeal that decision.

If you are in the EEA, you have the right to make a complaint at any time to the supervisory authority for data protection issues in your jurisdiction. For example, the supervisory authority for data protection issues in the UK is the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) ico.org.uk. We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before your supervisory authority, so please contact us in the first instance.

  

#### Advertising disclaimer

iFIT shares no affiliation with any political party or its views. iFIT ads visible on political websites are there as a result of remarketing—not a partnership, affiliation, or endorsement.

  

#### Children’s Information

Our services are not offered to Children. We do not knowingly collect, use, sell or share the personal information of children that are less than 16 years of age.

  

### 9\. GLOSSARY

  

#### LAWFUL BASIS

Legitimate interest means that we conduct and manage our business to enable us to give you the best services and products and the most secure experience. We consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required to or permitted by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us.

Performance of contract means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.

Comply with a legal or regulatory obligation means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal or regulatory obligation that we are subject to.

#### Sale or Sharing of Personal Data

As explained above, we use digital technologies, like cookies, beacons, Ad IDs, IP addresses and pixels for online advertising and analytics. We may disclose certain online identifiers with our advertising partners and analytics providers. Disclosing these identifiers with third parties for advertising or analytics purposes may be defined as the “sale” or “sharing” of your information under the CCPA. You have the right to opt-out of these uses. If you opt-out this type of “sale” or “sharing” of your information, we will not deliver customized advertising to you. You may still see non-targeted advertising about our products and services.

We may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA, or different prices, rates, levels, or quality of goods or services that are reasonably related to your personal information's value to the business. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time. For more information about the CCPA-permitted financial incentives that we offer, see our [Notice of Financial Incentive.](https://privacyportal-cdn.onetrust.com/dsarwebform/9f2a1fbd-e318-4058-aed9-27aa6caa6db1/97c00c4f-92c4-455e-9652-10a7896b3952.html)

#### NOTICE OF FINANCIAL INCENTIVE FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS

This Notice of Financial Incentive is part of iFIT's Privacy Notice and includes an explanation of financial incentives we offer California residents. This Notice of Financial Incentive applies solely to California residents. We adopt this Notice of Financial Incentive in accordance with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 ("CCPA").

From time-to-time, we offer coupons, discounted offerings, advance notices of sales and other special offerings and the opportunity to enter into contests and sweepstakes to consumers that have opted-in to the receipt of marketing material from us by providing us with certain personal information, such as their name, an email address, and a street address.

We may offer discounted pricing for certain products or services in the form of coupons or promo codes. We offer these incentives to encourage consumers to try our products and services or to learn more about our offerings. We offer other incentives based on a consumer’s purchase history or demographic data, such as advance notice of sales. We value the personal information collected in connection with these incentives by determining the approximate additional spending per consumer, per year compared to individuals that do not participate in our incentives.

Participation in our financial incentive programs requires your prior opt-in consent. You can opt-in to participate in the financial incentives described by checking the box when you sign up for an account or otherwise indicating your consent when you request information from us.

You may revoke your consent and withdraw from a financial incentive program at any time by doing one of the following:

* Calling us at [1.866.608.1798](#)
* Filling out the Notice of Financial Incentive found at  
    [this form.](https://privacyportal-cdn.onetrust.com/dsarwebform/9f2a1fbd-e318-4058-aed9-27aa6caa6db1/97c00c4f-92c4-455e-9652-10a7896b3952.html)
