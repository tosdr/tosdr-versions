We therefore inform you here about which of your personal data we collect when you visit our website and for what purposes it is used.

  

Since changes in the law or changes in our internal company processes may make it necessary to adapt our privacy policy, we ask you to read through our privacy policy on a regular basis. The privacy policy can be accessed, saved and printed out at any time under Privacy Policy.

When paying by credit card or other online payments, we do not collect or store payment transaction information such as credit card numbers or verification numbers. You only provide this information directly to the respective payment service provider. We delete your data as soon as you delete your user account with us or when the legal retention periods have expired.  
You can delete your user account yourself in the Settings or by sending us an email to [Softronics](https://www.softronics.ch/en/support/contact-form), with a request for deletion. The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR.

4\. Website -Tracking and Cookies
---------------------------------

This website partly uses so-called cookies. These serve to make the service more user-friendly, effective and secure. Cookies are small text files that the browser places and stores on your computer. You can prevent the storage of so-called cookies by making the appropriate setting in your browser software. However, we would like to point out that in this case not all functions of this website can be used to their full extent.

5\. Disclosure of personal data
-------------------------------

In addition to the controller, external service providers who assist us in providing our services may have access to your data. Occasionally, other third parties such as authorities, external consultants or certain business partners may receive your data.

### Online payments

For online payments, e.g. by credit card or TWINT, the payment is processed by an external service provider. For online payment, your details will be collected directly by the service provider Worldline Switzerland Ltd, Hardturmstrasse 201, CH-8005 Zurich.

### Third countries

Data transfers to third countries take place in compliance with the legally regulated admissibility requirements. If the transfer of data to a third country is not for the performance of our contract with you, we do not have your consent, the transfer is not necessary for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims, and no other exemption applies, we will only transfer your data to a third country if an adequacy decision pursuant to Article 45 GDPR or appropriate safeguards pursuant to Article 46 GDPR are in place. One of these adequacy decisions is the so-called "Privacy Shield" for the USA. For transfers to companies certified under the Privacy Shield, the level of data protection is generally considered adequate within the meaning of Article 45 of the GDPR. As a rule, however, we do not rely on the Privacy Shield, but create appropriate safeguards pursuant to Art. 46 of the GDPR and an adequate level of data protection by concluding the EU standard data protection clauses issued by the European Commission with the receiving entity.

### Additional recipients
