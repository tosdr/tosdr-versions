Since changes in the law or changes in our internal company processes may make it necessary to adapt our privacy policy, we ask you to read through our privacy policy on a regular basis. The privacy policy can be accessed, saved and printed out at any time under Privacy Policy.

You can delete your user account yourself in the Settings or by sending us an email to [Softronics](https://www.softronics.ch/en/support/contact-form), with a request for deletion. The legal basis for this processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR.

4\. Website -Tracking and Cookies
---------------------------------

This website partly uses so-called cookies. These serve to make the service more user-friendly, effective and secure. Cookies are small text files that the browser places and stores on your computer.

### Online payments

### Third countries

Data transfers to third countries take place in compliance with the legally regulated admissibility requirements. If the transfer of data to a third country is not for the performance of our contract with you, we do not have your consent, the transfer is not necessary for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims, and no other exemption applies, we will only transfer your data to a third country if an adequacy decision pursuant to Article 45 GDPR or appropriate safeguards pursuant to Article 46 GDPR are in place. One of these adequacy decisions is the so-called "Privacy Shield" for the USA. For transfers to companies certified under the Privacy Shield, the level of data protection is generally considered adequate within the meaning of Article 45 of the GDPR. As a rule, however, we do not rely on the Privacy Shield, but create appropriate safeguards pursuant to Art. 46 of the GDPR and an adequate level of data protection by concluding the EU standard data protection clauses issued by the European Commission with the receiving entity.
