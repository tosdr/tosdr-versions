    * **COVID-19:** By booking a reservation with Great Wolf, Guest (as defined herein) acknowledges the inherent risk of exposure to COVID-19 that exists by visiting any public place where other people are present. Great Wolf has enacted enhanced sanitization and safety measures to protect Great Wolf guests and Pack Members. Guest further acknowledges and agrees to comply with all safety requirements set out by Great Wolf, whether identified in advance of the reservation dates or otherwise informed while the Guest is on property. Without limiting the generality of anything herein, Guest expressly agrees to comply with face covering protocols in place at the time of the Guest stay. Further, in the event a change in reservations is requested due to family illness, the Deposit Policy, Non-Refundable Deposit Policy, Cancellation Policy, and Change Policy more fully set out below may be modified by Great Wolf, in its sole discretion.

        Fees include any applicable additional person fees and the resort fee. Each is applied to all reservation on a nightly basis. This policy may vary on suites contracted through Great Wolf Lodge’s group sales department. Additional person fees are applied when the base occupancy of the suite is exceeded. Additional guests may be added, up to the maximum occupancy of each individual suite. The additional person fee is $50 ($75 at Great Wolf Niagara Falls) and will be applied to guests three years and older. All occupants, regardless of age must be included on your reservation. Additional person fees will be adjusted accordingly if changes are made to your reservation.  
          
        If there is a remaining balance, it is settled at check in. In the event that there is a remaining balance post check out, you hereby authorize Great Wolf Lodge to apply funds you have on deposit against what you owe or charge your credit or debit card on file. The deposit policy can change based on the promotion applied.  
          
        
    * **Non-Refundable Deposit Policy:** Reservation deposits for the Early Saver promotion are subject to a non-refundable deposit after the time of booking. Reservation deposits for cabanas are considered earned and non-refundable if the reservation is canceled by Guest within 48 hours of check-in. Notwithstanding, in the event of cancelation of Cabana by Hotel at any time due to inclement weather, unavailability, or any other reason, the deposit will be refunded.   
          
        
    * **Standard Change and Cancellation Policy:** Guests making a reservation 8 or more days from their arrival date have 24 hours in which to modify the reservation with no penalties or fees. After that point, guests who wish to modify their reservation are subject to the following change fees:   
          
        * $25 if reservation is modified 8 or more days from arrival
        * $50 if reservation is modified less than 8 days from arrival
        * Great Wolf Lodge, Niagara Falls does not charge change fees  
              
            After applying the change fee, we can place the remaining balance on a deposit hold for up to 12 months to allow guests additional time to determine a future stay date if a change in their reservation is needed.  
              
            
        * Guests who wish to cancel their stay are subject to the below cancellation fees.

* [Great Wolf Gift Card Terms & Conditions](#)
    
    The following Gift Card Terms (referred to as the “Agreement”) describe the terms and conditions that apply to use of the Great Wolf Gift Cards (the “Cards”).  This Agreement is between you, the Cardholder, and Great Wolf Resorts, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, “Great Wolf” or “we”).  By purchasing, accepting, or using a Card, you agree to be bound by this Agreement.  If you do not agree with this Agreement, do not purchase, use, or accept the Card.  **IMPORTANT:  This Agreement includes in Paragraph 10 a class action waiver and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court.**
    
    **1\. About Your Card.**  The Cards are closed-loop gift cards issued in U.S. dollars; the Cards are not debit or credit cards.  To purchase gift cards for Great Wolf Lodge Niagara Falls, Ontario, please visit the lodge website. We issue both physical plastic Cards as well as digital (or “eGift”) Cards.  The Cards are issued by and solely an obligation of Great Wolf ; provided, however, that Great Wolf may assign its obligations with respect to the Card at any time, in which case such assignee shall become the issuer and sole legal obligor to the Cardholder.  Any information shared as a result of online purchases of Cards will be subject to our privacy policy, available at [https://www.greatwolf.com/terms#privacy-policy](https://www.greatwolf.com/terms#privacy-policy).
    
    **2\. Processing; Delivery.** Gift card orders will be processed within 48-72 hours. U.S. Postal delivery is not tracked or guaranteed. In addition to 3 business days for processing, please allow 7-10 business days for delivery. FedEx delivery not available outside of the U.S., FedEx cannot deliver to P.O. boxes, and a signature is required for all FedEx deliveries. All delivery times are estimated and not guaranteed.
    
    **3\. Redemption.**  Your Card is redeemable only for purchases of lodging, food, beverage, and merchandise at Great Wolf Lodge properties in the United States.   Cards have no cash value and may not be redeemed for cash (except as required by law).  Cards have no value until activated.  Cards are not redeemable to purchase another Card or toward a previous purchase.  We reserve the right to temporarily limit or disallow redemptions due to technical difficulties or other unforeseen circumstances.
    
    **4\. Balance Inquiry.**  For balance inquiry, visit [https://wwws-usa2.givex.com/cws4.0/greatwolflodge/check-balance/](https://wwws-usa2.givex.com/cws4.0/greatwolflodge/check-balance/) or call 866-646-9653.  The balance you receive when inquiring is an estimate only.  In most cases, the balance is adjusted immediately when you make a purchase, but there may be occasions when the balance adjustment is delayed.
    
    **5\. No Expiration; No Fees.**  The Cards do not expire.  No fees for inactivity or service fees apply to any Cards. 
    
    **6\. Not Reloadable.**  Cards may not be reloaded with additional value.

    **8\.

    **10\. Maximum Value.**  The maximum purchase amount of a Card is $500.  In addition, you may not purchase or obtain multiple Cards with a value of more than $5,000 in any one day
    
    **11\. Mandatory Binding individual Arbitration.** 
    
    Please read this section carefully.  It affects legal rights that you may otherwise have and requires individual final and binding arbitration of most disputes instead of resolution in court.
    
    Arbitration is the submission of a dispute to a neutral arbitrator, NOT a judge or jury, for a final and binding decision, known as an “award.”  Arbitration provides for more limited discovery than in court, is subject to limited review by courts, and the result is confidential.  Each party has an opportunity to present evidence to the arbitrator in writing or through witnesses.  An arbitrator can award the same damages and relief to you that a court can award under the law and must honor the terms and conditions in this Agreement. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED.
    
    **A. ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER**
    
    EXCEPT FOR DISPUTES THAT QUALIFY FOR SMALL CLAIMS COURT, ALL DISPUTES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY ASPECT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOU AND GREAT WOLF, WHETHER THE DISPUTE IS BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTE, FRAUD, MISREPRESENTATION, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, WILL BE RESOLVED IN FINAL, BINDING, INDVIDUAL ARBITRATION BEFORE A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF IN COURT BY A JUDGE OR A JURY. YOU AGREE THAT GREAT WOLF AND YOU EACH WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY A JURY AND THAT THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT ("FAA") AND FEDERAL ARBITRATION LAW, NOTWITHSTANDING THE “GOVERNING LAW” PROVISION BELOW, GOVERNS THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE.  YOU ALSO AGREE THAT ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, AND MASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED, AND YOU AGREE TO GIVE UP THE ABILITY TO BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
    
    FOR ANY AND ALL DISPUTES OR CLAIMS YOU HAVE, YOU MUST FIRST GIVE GREAT WOLF AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESOLVE YOUR CLAIM BY SENDING AN INDIVIDUAL, WRITTEN DESCRIPTION OF YOUR CLAIM THAT DESCRIBES IN DETAIL THE INDIVIDUAL DAMAGES THAT YOU CLAIM TO HAVE SUFFERED TO GREAT WOLF’S REGISTERED AGENT AT THIS ADDRESS:
    
    Cogency Global Inc.
    
    111 W Washington St.
    
    Suite 1447
    
    Chicago, IL 60602
    
    You and Great Wolf each agree to negotiate a claim in good faith. Each party agrees that it may not commence any arbitration or court proceeding unless you and Great Wolf are unable to resolve the claim within 60 days after receipt of the demand for arbitration and the parties have made good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly during that time. If you and Great Wolf are unable to resolve the claim within 60 days despite those good faith efforts, then either you or Great Wolf may start an arbitration or small claims court proceeding. Either you or Great Wolf may elect to have an arbitration proceeding initiated by the other party adjudicated in small claims court by giving written notice of that election to the other party.
    
    This agreement to arbitrate extends to claims that you assert against other parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement or use of the Card.
    
    This agreement to arbitrate shall survive termination of this Agreement.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, if any part of this agreement to arbitrate or class action waiver is deemed invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of the agreement to arbitrate shall still be considered valid and enforceable.  If any part of this agreement to arbitrate or class action waiver is deemed unenforceable with respect to any claim, the arbitration agreement and class action waiver will not apply to that claim, but they will still apply to any and all other claims that you or we may assert in that or any other action.  You reserve your ability to bring claims in small claims court to the extent of that court’s jurisdiction.
    
    If any part of this agreement to arbitrate is deemed invalid or inapplicable, you and Great Wolf waive, to the fullest extent allowed by law, any claims to recover punitive or exemplary damages and any right to pursue any claims on a class, mass, consolidated, or combined basis.
    
    **B. ARBITRATION PROCEDURES**
    
    Arbitration shall be conducted by National Arbitration and Mediation (“NAM”) under its Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures, including its Minimum Standards for Procedural Fairness for Consumer and Employment/Workplace Arbitrations, and its Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration Filings (the “NAM Rules”).  The NAM Rules and instructions for how to initiate an arbitration are available from NAM at https://www.namadr.com/ or 1-800-358-2550.  If NAM fails or declines to conduct the arbitration for any reason, you and we will mutually select a different arbitration administrator. If we cannot agree, a court will appoint a different arbitration administrator but will not decide arbitrability or any other aspect of the parties’ dispute (except as outlined above or if either party files a small claims court matter). Payment of arbitration fees will be governed by NAM’s schedule of “Fees for Disputes When One of the Parties is a Consumer.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any claim asserted in an arbitration demand is deemed to be frivolous, the defending party shall be entitled to recover its attorneys’ fees and any filing, administration, and arbitrator fees incurred. The arbitrator may award any individual relief a court of law could, including temporary, interim, or permanent injunctive relief on an individual basis.
    
    **12\. Limitation of Liability.**  GREAT WOLF MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE CARDS INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OR MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  IN THE EVENT THAT A CARD IS NON-FUNCTIONAL, YOUR SOLE REMEDY, GREAT WOLF’S SOLE LIABILITY, SHALL BE THE REPLACEMENT OF SUCH CARD.  CERTAIN STATE LAWS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OR CERTAIN DAMAGES.  IF THESE LAWS APPLY TO YOU, SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, OR LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
    
    **13\. Unclaimed Property.**  In the event you do not use your Card for a certain period of time, Great Wolf may be required to turn over the remaining Card balance to a state under such state’s unclaimed or abandoned property law.  Although your Card does not expire, if Great Wolf is obligated to turn over the remaining balance of your Card under a state’s unclaimed property law, by operation of law Great Wolf will be released from any further liability or obligation with respect to your Card, and you may be required to contact the state’s unclaimed property administrator to attempt to recover your unused Card balance.  To protect your right to continue to use your remaining Card balance, Great Wolf will make reasonable efforts to exempt your Card from state unclaimed property laws.
    
    **14\. Governing Law.**  The laws of the state of Wisconsin, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, apply to this Agreement and use of your Card.  If any part of this Agreement is unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that part will be deemed severable and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
    
    **15\. Changes to Agreement.**  Great Wolf reserves the right to change this Agreement from time to time in their discretion without special notice to you.  Notice of changes will be by reasonable means, which may be by the posting of the revised version of this Agreement on this website (“Updated Terms”).  Your use of a Card after Great Wolf has posted the Updated Terms constitutes your agreement to the Updated Terms.  The Updated Terms will be effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the Updated Terms and will apply to your use of a Card from that point forward.  The date of the last update to this Agreement is always indicated near the top of the page and any change in the date of this Agreement shall constitute notice to you that the Agreement has changed.
    
    **16\. Fraud/Violation of Terms.**  Great Wolf reserves the right to refuse to honor, or to suspend or deactivate one or more Cards where Great Wolf suspects that a Card was obtained fraudulently, in violation of this Agreement, or in violation of applicable laws or other applicable Great Wolf terms and conditions.

    **Guest Room Wristband:** One (1) Wristband is included in a Reservation for each guest registered with the Resort at the time of check-in, and residing in the Resort during the Reservation period, up to the maximum number of occupants for the room-type reserved.  Such Guest Room Wristband is valid only for the period of the corresponding Reservation.
    
    **Tethered Wristband:** Each Guest Room Wristband holder may purchase additional single-day Wristbands for individuals not residing at the Resort during the relevant Reservation period for a fee to be determined by Great Wolf from time to time. Such Tethered Wristbands are (i) for use only by invited visitors to Guest Room Wristband holders and not for resale or offer to the general public; (ii) subject to availability; (iii) valid for a single day only; and (iv) limited to one (1) per Guest Room Wristband holder.
    
    **Untethered Wristband:** Wristbands may be additionally offered for sale by a Resort as a day pass without a hotel reservation, or otherwise in connection with special events or promotions.  Such Wristbands may be subject to additional terms and conditions as part of the sale.
    
    **Admission to Great Wolf Attractions**
    
    A Wristband is valid for admission at the Resort from which it was issued and grants a revocable license to the registered, authenticated Wristband holder for admission and use of specified Great Wolf Attractions (unless restricted by conditions which could ultimately prohibit someone from participating safely, including without limitation, height, weight, age, physical limitations such as pregnancy and heart conditions, or observed inappropriate behavior) during the Validity Period. Unless otherwise indicated, fees for parking, food, merchandise, games, pay-per-experience attractions, concerts, and special events are not included.
    
    Great Wolf, in its absolute discretion, reserves the right to vary the opening and closing dates of the Great Wolf Attractions and to close, remove, or cancel all or any part of the rides, events or facilities within the Great Wolf Attractions for any reason, including without limitation, technical, health and safety, and/or operational reasons or due to special events or private functions. For the avoidance of doubt, the full value of any part of the value of the Wristband will not be refunded, nor will any compensation be paid or payable if any of the Great Wolf Attractions become unavailable or if any part of the Great Wolf Attractions are closed or removed.
    
    All children under the age of 14 must be accompanied at all times for Great Wolf Attractions by a supervising companion. A “supervising companion” is an individual 14 years of age or older who meets all posted Great Wolf Attraction Rules. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a Resort may impose certain other restrictions on age of purchasers of certain Wristband Types.
    
    **Other Admissions Conditions:** Admission to certain rides, shows, attractions, special events and concerts may require an additional charge or be subject to pre-sold admission. All operating dates and hours are subject to change without notice. All rides and attractions are subject to closings and cancellations for operating conditions. Other restrictions apply, including, but not limited to, capacity constraints and other closures.
    
    **Replacement of Wristband:** If a Wristband is lost, stolen, or forgotten, the Wristband can be replaced at the Resort’s front desk, and a non-refundable replacement fee may be charged. Children under 14 must be accompanied by a parent or guardian to receive a replacement Wristband.
    
    **Improper Behavior**
    
    A Wristband is a revocable license and may be revoked and/or confiscated by Great Wolf with no refund of purchase price or additional compensation provided for any violation of the Resort Rules.
    
    Violation of Resort Rules may result in expulsion from Great Wolf Attractions and the Resort. 
    
    Included within the Resort Rules are the expectations that all guests not (i) engage in disorderly conduct, (ii) use abusive or inappropriate language, (iii) wear clothing that is overly revealing or contains non-family friendly messaging or pictures, (iv) display tattoos that contains non-family friendly messaging or pictures, (v) engage in inappropriate interpersonal exchanges, including, without limitation, photographing or videotaping third parties without permission, unwanted physical contact, inappropriate gestures or other communications,  or unwanted communication with other guests or staff (including as may be distracting to staff on duty), or (vi) otherwise violate any Resort Rules or applicable laws. 
    
    **Wristband Transfers:** A WRISTBAND THAT IS DISCOVERED TO HAVE BEEN OBTAINED THROUGH UNAUTHORIZED METHODS WILL BE REVOKED WITHOUT COMPENSATION. Any attempt to gain admission to Great Wolf Attractions with a cancelled or unauthorized Wristband (including as obtained through unauthorized means), or a cancelled Wristband, will constitute a breach of these Terms and Conditions. Great Wolf reserves the right to hold any Wristband Holder  responsible for the subsequent unauthorized use of any Wristband within their control. Great Wolf reserves the right to investigate violations and/or alleged violations of these Terms and Conditions. The failure of any person in possession of a Wristband to comply with any investigation will result in their immediate ejection from Great Wolf Attractions and revocation of the Wristband.
    
    **Dispute Resolution**
    
    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY NOTED BELOW, ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU OR ANY OTHER WRISTBAND HOLDER AND GREAT WOLF ARISING UNDER, OUT OF, UNDER, IN CONNECTION WITH, OR IN RELATION TO THIS AGREEMENT MUST BE SUBMITTED TO BINDING ARBITRATION UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE FEDERAL ARBITRATOIN ACT. In the event of a dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating in any way to these Terms and Conditions or use of the Great Wolf Attractions, the complaining party shall notify the other party in writing. **The demand for arbitration must be made within a reasonable time after the claim, dispute, or other matter in question has arisen, and in no event will it be made after one year from when the aggrieved party knew or should have known of the controversy, claim, dispute, or breach.** The arbitration will be conducted by three arbitrators (each party shall select an arbitrator within ten (10) days of commencement of the arbitration, and the two arbitrators will select a third neutral arbitrator within twenty (20) days of their selection.) The arbitration will be conducted in Chicago, Illinois, and the laws of the state in which the Resort is located shall govern. Except as may be required by law, neither a party nor its representatives may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of all parties. Each party shall pay its own proportionate share of arbitrator fees and expenses.
    
    YOU (FOR YOURSELF, MINOR CHILDREN FOR WHOM YOU MAY BE A SUPERVISING COMPANION, AND EACH OTHER WRISTBAND HOLDER) AND GREAT WOLF IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.

PLEASE READ THE PROVISION CAREFULLY. IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH GREAT WOLF AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF. BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS, YOU AGREE TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE WITH US ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION OR SMALL CLAIMS DISPUTE PROCEDURES AND AGREE TO WAIVE YOUR RIGHTS TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION SUIT.**
    
    **Last Updated: \[September 19th, 2024\]**  
    
    These terms and conditions govern the Great Wolf Lodge® Voyagers Club (the “Program”). The Program is operated by Great Lakes Services, LLC (“Great Wolf,” or “we”). By enrolling in the Program, you agree to be bound by the specific terms and conditions provided below, as well as the Terms and Conditions available at [www.greatwolf.com/terms](https://www.greatwolf.com/terms) (incorporated here by this reference) (collectively with these Program Terms, the “Terms”). Participation in the Program is void if prohibited by law in the jurisdiction in which the prospective participant resides. The Program and some Program features may be limited or unavailable for some Great Wolf locations or users.
    
    The Program is a customer loyalty program that allows a Member (as defined below) the opportunity to participate in exclusive member promotions and to receive and redeem loyalty points (“Voyagers Points”) on an individual basis for their own account. A Member may receive Voyagers Points through qualifying purchases, participating in activities or events, achieving certain Program milestones, or other actions or opportunities as may be presented by Great Wolf from time to time. These Terms provide a general overview of the Program.
    
    Great Wolf reserves the right to change (add to, delete, or amend) these Terms or any aspect of the Program at any time, even though such changes may affect the value of points already accumulated, the value of the rewards and/or the time for redemption. Please check the Great Wolf website at [www.greatwolf.com/terms](http://www.greatwolf.com/terms) (“Website”) periodically for changes. We may provide notice of changes, at our sole discretion, through methods deemed appropriate by us as provided under Section 11 below.
    
    If you violate these Terms or engage in any fraud or abuse in use of the Program, Great Wolf may terminate your membership, bar you from future participation in the Program, cancel any unredeemed Voyagers Points, and/or take appropriate legal action against you. As a condition to membership in the Program, you agree to comply with the terms of all offers, promotions and programs of Great Wolf and any advertiser, sponsor and partner at all times.
    
    **1.     Eligibility**.  Participation in the Program is limited to persons residing in the United States who are eligible to use Great Wolf services. You must be at least 18 years of age (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction of residence) to participate in the GWL Program. Program accounts are limited to one individual per account. For the avoidance of doubt, only natural persons transacting in their personal capacity and for their own account are eligible to participate. Individuals are limited to one account per person and duplicate accounts (including under multiple email addresses) may be deleted or terminated by Great Wolf, in its sole discretion.  Participation in the Program is personal and non-transferable. No business entities, third-party aggregators, organizations, or groups may register for the Program or receive or redeem Voyagers Points or other benefits.
    
    Any offers a Member receives are specific to that Member's account, unless otherwise stated and are non-transferable. Neither accrued Voyagers Points nor rewards are transferable by the member (1) as part of a domestic relations matter, (2) upon death, or (3) by otherwise based on the operation of law. Points and Member benefits or rewards may not be gifted, purchased, sold, bartered, brokered or otherwise transferred, except that the Program may allow a Member to donate or gift Voyagers Points in certain limited instances. Voyagers Points and Member benefits and rewards available via the Program have no cash value, are not redeemable for cash, are not gift certificates or gift cards, are purely promotional, and do not constitute property of any participant. No portion of any payment for purchases qualifying for the Program or any Voyagers Points or rewards constitute consideration paid for any of the foregoing. Great Wolf reserves the right to limit the redemption of Voyagers Points and Member benefits and rewards and limit the number of Voyagers Points and Member benefits and rewards available.
    
    **2.     Enrollment.**  There is no fee associated with the Program. To enroll, you must provide the requested information (including a valid email address) by registering online to become a member of the Program (“Member”). Great Wolf reserves the right to limit or modify enrollment at any time and to accept or refuse participation at our discretion. Upon sign-up, you will be required to provide the requested information, including, but not limited to, name, password, and e-mail address. Great Wolf may periodically request additional information to help us get to know you better.
    
    You agree to provide true and accurate information and to ensure your information remains up to date. See our Privacy Policy regarding use of personal information. Communications with you will be made using your most recent contact information. Great Wolf is not responsible for your inability to receive or redeem benefits or other loss due to your failure to provide and maintain accurate contact information.
    
    **3.     Program Benefits**
    
    **Voyagers Points.**
    
    **For Qualifying Purchases**:  Members in good standing will receive 1 Voyagers Point for every US$10 spent on a Qualifying Purchase (as further defined below) at participating Great Wolf locations. 
    
    “Qualifying Purchase” includes the room rate charge paid by a Member upon the **completion of a stay (“Stay”)** at a participating Great Wolf location and the following purchases charged to the Member’s room during the Stay: (i) food, (ii) non-alcoholic beverages, (iii) attraction or food packages, (iv) cabana rentals, and (v) attraction purchases. Voyagers Points are not awarded upon booking a reservation, but upon completing a qualifying Stay at a participating Great Wolf location.  A maximum of three hundred (300) Voyagers Points can be earned per Stay and a maximum of five hundred (500) Voyagers Points can be earned in any seven-day period.  Group reservations are excluded and not eligible for Voyagers Points. 
    
    Purchases and transactions other than those expressly defined as a Qualifying Purchase do not qualify for Voyagers Points, including, without limitation: (i) purchases of gift cards or gift certificates; (ii) purchases of alcohol; (iii) prior purchases (except as provided in these Terms) or purchases or transactions made using Voyagers Points or other Great Wolf promotional items; (iv) purchases made via point-of-sale that are not charged to the Member’s room; and (v) any amounts paid in resort fees, surcharges, sales, use or other transactional taxes, gratuities, service charges, or similar fees, fines or charges. 
    
    For clarification, to qualify as a Stay, booking for the Stay at the Great Wolf location must be made directly with Great Wolf.  Any booking made on any third-party reservation platforms (e.g., Groupon, Expedia etc.) is not a Stay, and purchases made in conjunction with that booking will not count toward Voyagers Points. Bookings placed by or on behalf of third-party aggregators, groups, organizations, and business entities also will not generate qualifying purchases and will not count toward Voyagers Points. Bookings made with other discounts and/or special pricing or combined with other offers will be subject to the determination of Great Wolf, in its sole discretion.  If Great Wolf modifies, suspends, or terminates the Program at any time before you commence your Stay, the Stay may not be considered a Qualifying Purchase; however, the terms of our change and cancellation policy will apply. 
    
    **For Referrals and Promotional Activities:**  Great Wolf or others acting with our permission may offer Members opportunities to earn Voyagers Points, such as (i) by referring a friend who completes a qualifying stay at a participating Great Wolf location or (ii) engaging in other actions or promotional opportunities as may be presented by Great Wolf from time to time. Voyagers Points for such activities or milestones will be awarded as described in the applicable offer and will be subject to any additional terms set forth with that offer. These offers may be temporary in nature. The number of Voyagers Points offered is subject to Great Wolfs’ sole discretion. Great Wolf is under no obligation to provide Members with any particular number of Voyagers Point-earning opportunities, special offers, or to send messages to them. Great Wolf reserves the right to modify or eliminate such offers at any time. Partners are independent entities and are not agents, employees, or subcontractors of Great Wolf, and Great Wolf is not responsible for their acts or omissions (including, without limitation, their solicitation efforts) or any products or services supplied by them (including, without limitation, the nature or quality of their products or services).
    
    Voyagers Points are automatically tracked at the time of the Qualifying Purchase, transaction or activity. Voyagers Points for any single Qualifying Purchase may only be credited to one (1) account. Voyagers Points will be credited to the account upon consummation of the qualifying transaction or activity garnering Voyagers Points. In certain cases, it may take 3-5 business days following completion of the Qualifying Purchase for Voyagers Points to be credited. Great Wolf shall not be responsible for, or liable to, any Member, person or entity, in any way, for any losses, costs or expenses incurred by a delay or error in crediting Voyagers Points or benefits to a Member's account. Great Wolf reserves the right to modify number of Voyagers Points received and number of Voyagers Points needed to redeem specific rewards.
    
    Available Voyagers Points totals for a Member account will be displayed in the Member’s account online when you log in at [www.greatwolf.com](https://www.greatwolf.com/).
    
    **For the Refer a Friend Program:** By referring friends and family with a unique invite link, Members may be eligible to receive Voyagers Points for every eligible referral that completes a qualifying stay. Members will not be eligible to receive Voyagers Points from a referral if the referral recipient: (1) has previously completed a stay at a Great Wolf property, (2) has an existing reservation at a Great Wolf property at the time the referral is issued, (3) is an existing Member of the Program, (4) has an existing guest account with Great Wolf, or (5) has previously consented to receiving marketing communications from Great Wolf. Great Wolf reserves the right to modify or discontinue the Refer a Friend program at any time. Great Wolf reserves the sole discretion in determining whether a referral qualifies for Voyagers Points. Void where restricted or prohibited by law.
    
    **Maximum of 1,000 Voyager Points may be accumulated to a Member’s Voyagers account at any one time from the Refer a Friend Program.**
    
    4.  **How to Use and Redeem Voyagers Points**.  Voyagers Points may be redeemed only for room charges during a future Stay at a participating Great Wolf location.  Upon redemption, the total room charge for the Stay is reduced by the then-applicable value of the number of Voyagers Points that the Member redeems, after application of other promotional offers and discounts and before tax.  Voyagers Points may be used at the time of booking with Great Wolf to apply against a deposit or at check-out following a qualifying Stay.  Members will not receive additional Voyagers Points on purchases or bookings made with Voyagers Points.  Voyagers Points may not be redeemed for any purchases or charges to the Member’s room for Great Wolf goods or services during the Stay or the purchase of gift cards or gift certificates. Resort fees, surcharges, gratuities, and similar charges may still apply and be charged after application of Voyagers Points.  Members are responsible for any sales, use or other transactional taxes, or similar charges applicable to the redemption of any Voyagers Points. 
    
    To redeem Voyagers Points, a Member must be logged into his/her Member account at the time of booking the Stay.  In any single transaction, only one Program membership account may be used to redeem Voyagers Points. Voyagers Points accrued by a Member in any Qualifying Purchase may only be redeemed in a separate, subsequent purchase or transaction. Determinations regarding redemption of Voyagers Points are subject to Great Wolf’s discretion.
    
    Voyagers Points will be subtracted from the Member's account immediately when redemption is requested based on the total Voyagers Points redeemed. Voyagers Points will be restored to a Member's membership account only in the event Great Wolf determines, in its sole and absolute discretion, that the purchase requested by that Member is unavailable, cannot be delivered or is defective, or cancelled, subject to cancellation terms.
    
    Voyagers Points may be subject to limitations on redemption, including, without limitation, booking availability at the selected Great Wolf location, black-out dates, notwithstanding any errors in advertising to the contrary. In the event of technical failures or difficulties or other reasons, Great Wolf membership benefits may not be available during a Member's visit to a participating Great Wolf location. Members are not entitled to any compensation as a result of such technical failures or difficulties. 
    
    **Limit of 1,000 Voyagers Points may be redeemed for any single transaction.**
    
    **5\.   Voyagers Points Expiration.**  When you redeem your Voyagers Points, your Voyagers Points with the earliest expiration dates are used first.  All Voyagers Points that have not been redeemed will expire fifteen (15) months after the date upon which the Voyagers Points were received (which is the date of the Qualifying Purchase for which the Voyagers Points were received).
    
    All other offers and other Member benefits expire in connection with the terms provided with that reward offer or Member Benefit.
    
    **6.  Special Offers.**  Great Wolf in its sole and absolute discretion, may periodically send offers to Members, or distribute offers to customers (whether or not they are Members). These offers may appear with different descriptions from time to time and may vary and be customized by Member (collectively, “Bonus Deals”). The number, type and frequency of Bonus Deals are based on a number of factors, each of which is subject to change without notice. Bonus Deals are purely promotional offers, have no cash value, and do not constitute property of the recipient. Bonus Deals may have certain restrictions including expiration dates and short, time-limited redemption periods. Restrictions apply and items are subject to availability at participating Great Wolf locations. All Bonus Deals must be redeemed prior to the stated expiration date to be valid. Determinations regarding redemption of Bonus Deals are subject to the discretion of the participating Great Wolf location. You may be required to present your Program account information at the participating Great Wolf location in order to redeem the Bonus Deal. Read each offer carefully for specific details, limitations and restrictions.
    
    **7\.   Inactive Accounts.**  Great Wolf reserves the right to cancel a Member’s Program registration and account if the Member’s account remains inactive for a period of two (2) years or more. Accordingly, once you register for the Program, if you do not make a purchase or engage in an activity for which you will receive Voyagers Points within your Member account within two (2) years after your initial registration or the last recorded purchase or activity for which you received Voyagers Points, Great Wolf reserves the right to cancel your account. You understand and agree that cancellation by Great Wolf of your Program account will result in the cancellation and forfeiture of all Voyagers Points, rewards, Member benefits, and the inability to earn and/or redeem further Voyagers Points, rewards, and Member benefits.
    
    **8.  User Conduct**.  Without limiting the user conduct terms under the Website Terms and Conditions, by joining the Program, you agree to remain courteous and respectful toward employees, contractors, and agents of Great Wolf, its affiliates, operators, partners, guests and other Members. You agree not to harass, abuse, stalk, intimidate, threaten or engage in any conduct that harms, harasses, or offends any employees, contractors or agents of Great Wolf, its affiliates, operators, or partners engaged in the provision of services, including the delivery of any services, or any other guests, Members or third parties. 
    
    **9. Cancellation; Termination.**  Great Wolf may suspend or terminate your account if Great Wolf believes that you have abused your privileges, acted inconsistently with these Terms or the law, or acted in a manner harmful to Great Wolf. Termination by Great Wolf of your account will result in cancellation and forfeiture of all Voyagers Points and associated Member benefits, and Great Wolf has no obligation to refund or credit you any amount following such termination by Great Wolf. In some cases you may still receive messages (which may have been scheduled prior to the account termination) after termination of enrollment in the Program. Great Wolf shall be the sole arbiter in cases of suspected abuse, fraud or violation of these Terms, and any decision it makes relating to termination or disabling of Program account shall be final and binding.
    
    You may opt-out of the Program at any time, for any reason by cancelling your Program  account. If you cancel your account, any unredeemed Voyagers Points, rewards or Member benefits, and/or progress towards the foregoing will automatically be cancelled and forfeited and will no longer be available for redemption.  Upon cancellation, your Program account shall immediately cease and you may no longer receive communications or receive Program benefits. Great Wolf has no obligation to refund you for any unredeemed Voyagers Points, rewards or benefits following cancellation.
    
    Great Wolf reserves the right to modify, suspend, or terminate, at Great Wolf's sole and absolute discretion, the Program in its entirety, for any reason. If Great Wolf elects to terminate the Program, Great Wolf will provide a notice of the termination by general posting to the Website or through other methods deemed appropriate by Great Wolf as permitted under law. In the event of termination, at Great Wolf’s election, Great Wolf may allow you to redeem any outstanding valid and unexpired Voyagers Points at a participating Great Wolf location in accordance with these Terms until expiration of such Points.
    
    **10. Disclaimer of Warranties/Limitation of Liability.** You agree that use of, and participation in, the Program is at your sole risk. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL GREAT WOLF OR ITS SUPPLIERS OR VENDORS OR ITS OR THEIR RESPECTIVE EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, AFFILIATES, SUBCONTRACTORS, LICENSORS OR PARTNERS (COLLECTIVELY, "GREAT WOLF PARTIES") BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, COMPENSATORY, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF PROFITS, WORK STOPPAGE, LOSS OF GOODWILL, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LITIGATION OR OTHER PECUNIARY LOSS, REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH THE USE, OPERATION OR PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM, OR WITH INABILITY TO PROVIDE OR USE ANY BENEFITS, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE DISCLAIMER OR LIMITATION OF WARRANTIES, SO THE DISCLAIMERS SET FORTH ABOVE MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH STATE LAW APPLIES TO YOU.
    
    **11. Notices; Electronic Communications.** Great Wolf will give notices for the Program, at Great Wolf's sole discretion, except as required by law, by email, regular mail, general posting on the Website or postings in participating Great Wolf locations, or through other methods deemed appropriate by Great Wolf as permitted under law.
