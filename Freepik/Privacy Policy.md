#### 2\. Website Use under Terms and Conditions

You can only contract our services and validly accept the relevant Terms of Use of each Website if you are of legal age.

Our products are directed to people of legal age. In specific cases, we may explicitly allow them to be hired for use by minors. They must be examined and accepted, on the minor behalf, by the person of legal age who is the holder of the parental authority or in charge of their custody or education.

Notwithstanding the aforementioned, if you are a minor, in accordance with our terms and conditions, you cannot validly enter into any of the contracts we offer.

#### 3\. Our purposes and lawful basis of data we collect

Your personal data is processed with different purposes. Each processing must be based on a lawful basis, among those set forth by the regulation. We use the following basis:

1. **Consent:** you have given your informed, unequivocal and specific consent to the processing of your personal data aimed to a specific purpose.
2. **Legal obligation:** the law requires process and disclose certain data on occasions to certain institutions (for example, to the Tax Authority).
3. **Execution of a contract:** the data are strictly necessary to provide you with our services or to comply with what was agreed with you.
4. **Our legitimate interests,** provided that your interests and rights do not prevail over them.

The legal bases of our data processing carried out through our Website, in relation to the purposes for which we will use your data, are the following:

##### 3.1. Browsing the Website

When you browse and use the Website, even if you do not register, data is automatically collected through technology or automated interactions, such as IP address, device id, certains metadata (HTTP header, your browser, etc.). In addition, information is collected on the number of downloads and searches you perform. These data are recorded in order to control the number of downloads made by each user, thus allowing us to detect a fraudulent or illegitimate use of the Website, and, therefore, guarantee compliance with the relevant Terms of Use of each Website, that is, **the management of the contractual relationship between you and Freepik.**

These technical data observed when the user browser the Website are processed for the purpose of detecting and mitigating risks of attacks (bots, code injections, DDOS attacks), and, generally, **to guarantee and maintain the Website security**. Our lawful basis is our **legitimate interest** in protecting the security of our systems and preventing the violation of our terms and conditions.

**Personal data processed:** IP address, device id and certain metadata such as the browser used or the HTTP/HTTPS header.

##### 3.2. Contractual relationship with our registered users (free or premium)

When you register as a user (either free or "premium"), we request the personal data that we need for the management and fulfillment of our **contractual relationship** with you.

When you are requested to provide personal data that is deemed as necessary, due to legal obligation or in accordance with our contracting conditions, and you refuse to provide them, we may not be able to formalize said contract or provide the service, which will be communicated to you properly.

* **Personal data processed (free users):** username, email address, name, address and profession. Only the email address and username are required.
* **Personal data processed (premium users):** the above, plus country, city of residence, identity document, tax residence, and means of payment (all data are mandatory).

You can open your account as a registered user on Freepik with your own account on other platforms, such as Google, using the federated Login that you will find at the top of our websites, and access whenever you want through them, without having to create and remember a specific username and password to access Freepik.

This option is possible due to the collaboration between Freepik and Google as the joint controllers of the processing of your personal data, so that (i) you can identify yourself directly on these platform, (ii) they confirm that you are who you say you are, and (iii) we provide you with your login as a registered user on Freepik.

Freepik obtains from this platform, with your previous consent, your username, image and email address in order to register you as a Freepik user. On the other hand, this platform collects online identifiers (IP address), technical identifiers (from your device, as well as their advertising identifiers such as your "Google ID") and record, each time you use their login, the date and time of your access to Freepik. Further information can be found in [Google Privacy & Terms.](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

You can exercise your rights of access, rectification, erasure, limitation of processing, portability and revocation of consent in relation to the personal data obtained from these platforms (and other data that you may have provided to Freepik in your relationship with us) by contacting Freepik at the email address provided in this policy.

Please note that the rectification or deletion of your data in your Freepik account does not automatically imply the rectification or deletion of your data and accounts on the platforms that authenticate your identity: you must also contact them to exercise your rights.

To exercise your personal data protection rights in relation to any other data arising from your relationship with these platforms, you should contact the relevant platform.

##### 3.3. Contractual relationship with our external creators

When we formalize a collaboration agreement with you if you are a creator of content to be distributed and licensed by Freepik, we request the personal data that we need for the management and fulfillment of our **contractual relationship**.

**Personal data processed:** email address, full name, address, city of residence, tax residence, id documents and way of payment.

##### 3.4. Models included in our content

If you appear as a model of images or videos offered as content on our website, we process your personal data included in the legal documentation and your image and/or voice is incorporated into our products for marketing on our websites, based on your contract with the external creator or directly with us, as the case may be.

Your image and/or voice may be used for purposes of development, training, testing, or improvement of software, algorithms, and machine learning models in combination with other images, texts, graphics, films, audios, and audiovisual works, always in an aggregated form, without the processing pursuing or making it possible to uniquely identify you.

**Personal data processed:** image or voice and the data recorded in the image rights assignment document -name, surname, identity document or equivalent, and address-.

Your data is publicly communicated worldwide through the internet -our websites- and is transferred to third parties in the form of licenses or access to the content. These international data transfers are made to countries with a level of personal data protection lower than that provided for in the GDPR, under the exception in Article 49(1)(a) of the GDPR.

##### 3.5. Personalized advertising on Freepik and other websites

We promote our products:

\- **with social networks and other platforms users, between profiles of potential Freepik users**, using audience segmented by interests, not created by Freepik but already offered by platforms such as Pinterest, Google and Twitter and hired by Freepik for this purpose. Likewise, we can only identify you if you register as an user.

Our lawful base is our legitimate interests of getting new clients through personalized advertising of our products through profiling offered by social media and other platforms.

**Personal data processed**: We do not directly process personal data: we select the groups of users to whom advertising will be displayed based on the segments offered by the platforms, such as age ranges or country. These platforms provide us with aggregated information about the performance of each campaign, but we cannot identify the specific users who have become registered users as a result of it.

\- through **retargeting**: impacting visitors who have visited and left our Website without registering, when they have accepted the use of our cookies, and these allow us to display advertising to them on third party websites.

In this case, our basis of legitimacy is your **consent** (given both on our Website as on third party websites where the advertising is displayed). You can find more information about this treatment in our [Cookie Policy.](https://www.freepikcompany.com/legal/cookies)

##### 3.6. Sending of commercial communications by email

We will send you electronic commercial communications if (i) you have registered or contracted any of the Website Services, (ii) you request information about our products through any of the forms for this on the Website. In any case, we will do so as long as you have not expressed your objection to receiving such communications (you can do this conveniently via the specific slider in your user profile, as well as in each communication you receive, at the bottom, via the "Unsubscribe" button).

We will also send you content updates from the creators you follow, provided that you have specifically consented to this via the specific slider on your user profile. You can revoke your consent by unchecking it.

Our legal basis is our **legitimate interest** (to offer you commercial information about products or services similar to those that you have already contracted or about which you have requested information), by virtue of art. 21.2 of Law 34/2002 of July 11, of Information Society Services and Electronic Commerce (LSSI).

##### 3.7. Advertisements on our Website

Unless you become a premium user, we will display personalized advertisements on our Website, if you consent the installation of cookies (more information in our [Cookies Policy](https://www.freepikcompany.com/legal/cookies)).

When we use cookies, we do so based on your prior **consent**. You can accept or reject all our cookies or select them granularly, through our One Trust CMP (our cookie setting panel).

When you enter your email address on our website (either to log in, or to sign up to a newsletter, or similar) we may share personal or other information that we collect from you, such as your email (in hashed, pseudonymous form), IP address, or information about your browser or operating system, with our partner LiveRamp, Inc. and its group.
