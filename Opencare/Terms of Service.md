Welcome to Opencare! The website(s) including the domain and sub­domains of https://www.opencare.com (the **“Site”**) referencing this Opencare Terms of Use (the **“Terms of Use”**) are owned and operated by Opencare Inc. (**“Opencare”**, **“we”** or **“us”**). These Terms of Use set out important information regarding the terms and conditions of your access and use of the Site and the features and functionality of the Opencare services described below (together with the Site, the **“Services”**). These Terms of Use form an agreement between Opencare and you. The terms **“you”**, **“your”** or **“User”** refers to the person browsing, accessing or otherwise using the Services (**“use”** or **“using”** in these Terms of Use will mean any of the foregoing). If you execute an electronic or paper order form (**“Order Form”**) with us to purchase Services, the Order Form also forms part of this Agreement and the term **“Customer”** shall refer to the person executing the Order Form with Opencare.

If you do not agree to be bound by these Terms of Use, **_do not access the Site or use the Services_**. In some instances, both these Terms of Use and separate guidelines, rules, or terms of use or sale setting forth additional or different terms and/or conditions will apply to your use of the Services or to a service or product offered via the Services, including a Business Associate Agreement (in each such instance, and collectively, “Additional Terms”). These Terms of Use do not alter in any way the Additional Terms you may have or will have with Opencare. To the extent that there is any conflict between these Terms and any Additional Terms or other agreements you have with Opencare, those other Additional Terms or agreements will govern. By using the Site or the Services, you further acknowledge and accept the Opencare’s [Privacy Policy](https://www.opencare.com/privacy/) and consent to the collection and use of your data in accordance with our [Privacy Policy](https://www.opencare.com/privacy/).

We will communicate with you by e-mail or by posting notices on this Site. You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing. The use of the term “partner” is not intended to indicate that the “partners” are in a legal partnership with Opencare.

13\. Limitations of Liability.
------------------------------

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL WE BE LIABLE, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES; OR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF DATA, PERSONAL INJURY, FINES, FEES, PENALTIES OR OTHER LIABILITIES, IN EACH CASE, WHETHER OR NOT WE WERE ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, RESULTING FROM OR RELATED TO THE SERVICES OR THESE TERMS OF USE. FOR ANY OTHER DAMAGES, OR TO THE EXTENT THAT THE FOREGOING LIMITATION IS NOT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL OUR TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH OR UNDER THESE TERMS OF USE, OR YOUR USE OF, OR INABILITY TO MAKE USE OF, THE SERVICES EXCEED $1,000, OR, IF YOU HAVE EXECUTED AN ORDER FORM WITH OPENCARE, THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF FEES PAYABLE BY YOU TO OPENCARE IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE EVENT THAT GAVE RISE TO LIABILITY. FOR GREATER CERTAINTY, THE EXISTENCE OF ONE OR MORE CLAIMS UNDER THESE TERMS OF USE WILL NOT INCREASE THIS MAXIMUM LIABILITY AMOUNT.

14\. ARBITRATION AGREEMENT; CLASS ACTION WAIVER
-----------------------------------------------

**PLEASE READ THESE PROVISIONS CAREFULLY, AS THEY AFFECT YOUR RIGHTS**

The laws of the State of New York shall govern these Terms of Use. While we will make reasonable efforts to resolve any disagreements you may have with Opencare, if these efforts fail you agree that all claims, disputes or controversies against Opencare arising in connection with or in any way relating to the relationship between you and Opencare, including your use of the Site and the Services, (“Claims”) will be determined mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration (except for matters that may be taken to small claims court), no matter what legal theory they are based on or what remedy (damages, or injunctive or declaratory relief) they seek. This includes Claims based on contract, tort (including intentional tort), fraud, agency, your or our negligence, statutory or regulatory provisions, or any other sources of law; Claims made as counterclaims, cross-claims, third- party claims, interpleaders or otherwise; and Claims made independently or with other claims. The party filing arbitration must submit Claims to the American Arbitration Association and follow its rules and procedures for initiating and pursuing arbitration. Any arbitration hearing that you attend will be held at a place chosen by the American Arbitration Association in the same city as the U.S. District Court closest to your then current residential address, or at some other place to which you and Opencare agree in writing, and the arbitrator shall apply New York law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act. You may obtain copies of the current rules, and forms and instructions for initiating arbitration by contacting the American Arbitration Association at using the contact information noted below.

American Arbitration Association  
Website: www.adr.org

A single, neutral arbitrator will resolve Claims. The arbitrator will be either a lawyer with at least ten (10) years’ experience or a retired or former judge, selected in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration will follow the procedures and rules of the American Arbitration Association which are in effect on the date the arbitration is filed unless those procedures and rules are inconsistent with these Terms and Conditions, in which case these Terms and Conditions will prevail. Those procedures and rules may limit the discovery available to you or us. The arbitrator will take reasonable steps to protect your customer account information and other confidential information if requested to do so by you or us. Each party to the arbitration will bear the expense of that party’s attorneys, experts, and witnesses, and other expenses, regardless of which party prevails, but a party may recover any or all expenses from another party if the arbitrator, applying applicable law, so determines. The arbitrator’s award is final and binding on the parties.

YOU AND OPENCARE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, CONSOLIDATED ACTION, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION. UNLESS YOU AND OPENCARE AGREE, NO ARBITRATOR OR JUDGE MAY CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS OR OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, CONSOLIDATED ACTION OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION.

15\. Term and Termination; Survival.
------------------------------------

These Terms of Use will commence on the day you first use the Services and will continue for as long as you use the Services or until terminated in accordance with the provisions of these Terms of Use (the “Term”). If you have not executed an Order Form, at any time, Opencare may: (i) suspend or terminate your rights to access or use the Services; or (ii) terminate these Terms of Use; if, in the sole discretion of Opencare, you fail to comply with any of these terms of these Terms of Use or engage in any fraudulent activity. You may terminate these Terms of Use at any time and with immediate effect by ceasing use of the Services. For greater certainty, if you continue to use any portion of the Services after these Terms of Use has been terminated, the Terms of Use will continue to apply to the extent of such use. In the event of termination, you are no longer authorized to access the benefits of this Site.

The provisions of these Terms of Use and any Additional Terms which expressly or by their nature should survive termination or expiration, or which contemplate performance or observance subsequent to termination or expiration of these Terms of Use or any Additional Terms, will survive expiration or termination of these Terms of Use for any reason, including the rights and licenses you grant to Opencare in these Terms, as well as the indemnities, releases, disclaimers, and limitations on liability and the provisions regarding jurisdiction, choice of law, and no class action.

16\. General.

3. Waiver. Our failure to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms of Use will not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right.
