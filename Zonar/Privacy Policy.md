Your Rights Under the CCPA

California residents have certain rights, subject to legal limitations, regarding the collection, use, and sharing of Personal Information. Except with respect to your Right to Opt-Out, please see Section 11 above for details regarding making a request to exercise these rights.

* **Right to Know.** You may have the right to request information about the categories of Personal Data we have collected about you, the categories of sources from which we collected the Personal Data, the purposes for collecting, selling, or sharing the Personal Data, and to whom we have disclosed your Personal Data and why. You may also request the specific pieces of Personal Data we have collected about you.
* **Right to Delete.** You have the right to request that we delete Personal Information that we have collected from you.
* **Right to Correct.** You have the right to request that we correct inaccurate Personal Information that we maintain about you.
* **Right to Opt-Out (“Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information”).** You have the right to opt out of the sale or sharing of your Personal Information.

* Special Note Regarding Your Right to Opt-Out. You may Opt-Out of the sale or sharing of your Personal Information collected through the Website by clicking the **Do Not Sell** link available at the bottom of each page of the Website. You must complete this step on each of our websites from each browser and on each device that you use. These steps are necessary so that we can place a first-party cookie signaling that you have opted out on each browser and each device you use.
* To the extent required by law, we will honor opt-out preference signals sent in a format commonly used and recognized by businesses, such as an HTTP header field or JavaScript object. We will process opt-out preference signals at the browser level.

We may decline to process your request where we have a legitimate basis. **We will not discriminate against you, in any manner prohibited by applicable law, for exercising these rights.**

Verification: In order to exercise your rights, we will need to obtain information to locate you in our records or verify your identity depending on the nature of the request. In most cases, we will collect some or all of the following data elements: first and last name, email address, and telephone number. In some cases, we may request different or additional information, including a signed declaration that you are who you say you are. We will inform you if we need such information.

Authorized Agents: Authorized agents may exercise rights on behalf of consumers by emailing us at [privacy@continental.com](mailto:privacy@continental.com), or by calling (833) 656-0555 and indicating that they are submitting the request as an agent. We may require the agent to demonstrate authority to act on behalf of the consumer by providing signed permission from the consumer. We may also require the consumer to verify their own identity directly with us or to directly confirm with us that they provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request.

Timing: We will process Right to Opt-Out requests within 15 business days. We will respond to Right to Delete, Right to Correct, and Right to Know requests within 45 days unless we need more time, in which case we will notify you and may take up to 90 days total to respond to your request.
