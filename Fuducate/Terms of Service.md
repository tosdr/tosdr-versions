The arbitration shall be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by these Terms of Service, and shall be administered by the AAA. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this arbitration clause, but the arbitrator is bound by these Terms of Service. Except as otherwise provided for herein, Fooducate will pay all AAA filing, administration and arbitrator fees. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought is improper or not warranted, as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), then the payment of all such fees shall be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse Fooducate for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. If the arbitrator grants relief to you that is equal to or greater than the value of your demand, Fooducate shall reimburse you for your reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses incurred for the arbitration. **You agree that, by entering into these Terms of Service, you and Fooducate are waiving the right to a trial by jury. You and Fooducate agree that YOU AND Fooducate MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding**. Further, you agree that the arbitrator may not consolidate proceedings or more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding, and that if this specific proviso is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration clause shall be null and void.

2.4 _Formal Resolution_. If we cannot resolve a Claim informally, you and Fooducate each agree to submit to personal jurisdiction in Israel and agree that any and all Claims either of us asserts shall be exclusively brought in the appropriate court in Israel, provided that neither you nor Fooducate shall be precluded from filing a Claim in small claims court, regardless of whether such small claims court is located in Israel, for disputes within the jurisdiction of a small claims court.

2.5 _Governing Law and Jurisdictional Issues_. These Terms of Service are governed in all respects by the substantive laws of the State of Israel. The UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly disclaimed. Those who choose to access our Services from other locations do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable. Access to our Services from any territory where the content is illegal is prohibited.
