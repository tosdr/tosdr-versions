Where do we get our information?

Every local, state, and federal government agency compiles records that are available under various open record laws. With a few common exceptions to protect personal privacy, any citizen can access any of these records if they know where to look. American DataBank simply compiles many of these records to provide information needed to verify a person’s identity, history or a business’s capabilities. All of the information we provide is in full accordance with state and federal privacy laws and our own privacy protection policies.

#### About the Sources

American DataBank distributes public-record and non-public information obtained directly from government entities or from reputable third parties who have compiled such information from governmental entities. Since all of the information that American DataBank provides comes from public records, we are not in a position to correct alleged inaccuracies in the data.

Our commitment to furnish users with reasonably accurate reproduction of information in public record information systems does not permit alteration of the substantive content of public record information products or services. However, when contacted by an individual concerning an alleged inaccuracy about that individual, American DataBank will inform the party who provided the information.
