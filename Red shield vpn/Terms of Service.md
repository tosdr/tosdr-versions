### **What is Red Shield VPN?**

A simple VPN app for your mobile devices and PCs will give you access to any websites and will encrypt traffic from the user's device to the service’s server. 

### **DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE**

a) Please refer to Privacy Notice for contact details.

b) Red Shield VPN is a privacy enhancing service operating within the European Union legal framework and technological solutions.

c) Red Shield VPN is a Virtual Private Network which encrypts the data sent and received on the Internet. Outgoing data is encrypted before leaving your computer, decrypted by one of Red Shield VPN servers and routed to the Internet. Incoming data is encrypted from one of Red Shield VPN servers and are decrypted only when they are inside your computer. Outgoing data packets do not contain your IP address when they are on the Internet, instead they have the IP address of one of Red Shield VPN servers.

d) Red Shield VPN uses OpenVPN and/or IPSec and/or OpenConnect and RedLink protocol  to establish the connection between your computer and the servers. OpenVPN and IPSec are the most reliable and secure solutions for encrypted tunnels.

e) Red Shield VPN encrypts your Internet data when you are connected to one of the Red Shield VPN servers. When you are not connected, Red Shield VPN enhancing privacy and anonymization layer services are not active. All applications launched AFTER you connect to the VPN service will use the service - no configuration is needed.

f) Red Shield VPN fully complies with the European Union directives which protect your privacy: Directive on Data Protection (95/46/EC) and Directive concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy (2002/58/EC). Using the service implies that you have read and understood our Privacy Notice.

### **How does it work?**

Our applications allow you to create an encrypted tunnel to our servers in the selected country with just one click.  
Then you simply use the Internet as if you are in the country that you have chosen to connect to.  
This allows you to bypass locks, hide from third parties - special services, Internet providers and hackers the data you transmit, and what resources you use.  
We do not keep logs of your connections or traffic - accordingly, we do not transfer them to third parties.  
Unlike free VPN and proxy services, we do not earn on the analysis and sale of user traffic.

### **Gift a VPN**

Terms of Services apply to both who bought the coupon, and to the one who uses the subscription on it.

### **Restriction of ads, tracking and malware**

The service is implemented by blocking well-known addresses from which advertising is distributed; from which tracking and phishing activities are carried out, on special DNS servers.  
Restriction or blocking of any advertising, any tracking and any phishing or other resources is not guaranteed.
