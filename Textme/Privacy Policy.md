**Your Rights Under the CCPA**

If you are a California resident and the CCPA is presently applicable to you, the CCPA provides you with certain specific rights regarding your personal information. This section describes your rights under the CCPA and explains how you can exercise those rights.

**Access to Specific Information and Data Portability Rights**

You have the right to request that We disclose certain information to you about Our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months. Once We receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights), We will disclose to you:

* The categories of personal information We collected about you.
* The categories of sources for the personal information We collected about you.
* Our business or commercial purpose for collecting that information.

We do not provide these access and data portability rights for business-to-business personal information.

**Deletion Request Rights**

You have the right to request that We delete any of your personal information that We collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once We receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see [Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights](#Exercising Rights)), We will delete (and direct Our service providers to delete) your personal information from Our records, unless an exception applies.

We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for Us or Our service provider(s) to:

* Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of Our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform Our contract with you.
* Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.
* Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.

* Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 seq.).
* Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information’s deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research’s achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.
* Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with Us.
* Comply with a legal obligation.
* Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.

**Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights**

To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to Us by Submitting a request to Us by visiting the Privacy Center in the Me page of the App (please update to the latest App version).

Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child. You may use an authorized agent to submit a request. To designate an agent for these purposes:

* You must provide us with a copy of a written and signed permission given to your authorized agent; and
* ou must verify your own identity directly with us.

You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must provide sufficient information that allows Us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative, which may include verifying the email address you used when establishing an account, and by logging into your account and making the request through the app.

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.

We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.

**Response Timing and Format**

We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.

We will deliver Our written response to the email address You used to setup Your account.

Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

**Non-Discrimination**

We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:

* Deny you goods or services.
* Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
* Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.
* Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
