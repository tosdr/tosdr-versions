**OUTBOUND SERVICE (UNITED STATES) – NO 911 CALLING FUNCTIONALITY**

**YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE OUTBOUND SERVICE DOES NOT ALLOW FOR 911 OR EMERGENCY CALLING. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT EVEN IF SUCH CALLS COMPLETE, WHICH THEY MAY NOT, SUCH CALLS MAY NOT BE ROUTED TO THE APPROPRIATE EMERGENCY CALLING CENTER, THAT THE EMERGENCY CALL TAKER MAY NOT AUTOMATICALLY RECEIVE YOUR TELEPHONE NUMBER OR ANY TELEPHONE NUMBER SUCH THAT THE EMERGENCY CALL TAKER WILL NOT BE ABLE TO CALL YOU BACK, AND MAY NOT RECEIVE ANY INFORMATION OR DATA WITH RESPECT TO YOUR LOCATION. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU WILL NOT RELY ON THE OUTBOUND SERVICE FOR EMERGENCY CALLS AND THAT THE OUTBOUND SERVICE IS NOT INTENDED TO REPLACE TRADITIONAL WIRELINE OR WIRELESS CALLING SERVICES. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY AND ALL ISSUES WITH RESPECT TO RELYING ON THE OUTBOUND SERVICE FOR EMERGENCY CALLS AND FOR ANY THIRD PARTIES THAT MAY RELY ON IT FOR EMERGENCY CALLS.**

**OUTBOUND SERVICE (CANADA RESIDENTS AND USERS ONLY): 9-1-1 ALTERNATIVE SERVICE CANADA ONLY**

**This section is relevant for the usage of Outbound Service in Canada only.**

**THIS SECTION CONTAINS IMPORTANT PROVISIONS, INCLUDING THOSE REGARDING 9-1-1 SERVICE:** 

Description:  VoIP services allow you to make or receive telephone calls over the Internet to or from the public switched telephone network.  The nature of VoIP telephone calls, while appearing similar to traditional telephone calling services, create unique limitations and circumstances, and you acknowledge and agree that differences exist between traditional telephone service and VoIP telephone services, including the lack of traditional 9-1-1 emergency services. 

9-1-1 service:  Because of the unique nature of VoIP telephone calls, emergency calls to 9-1-1 through your VoIP service will be handled differently than traditional telephone service.  The following provisions describe the differences and limitations of 9-1-1 emergency calls, and you hereby acknowledge and understand the differences between traditional 9-1-1 service and VoIP calls with respect to 9-1-1 calls placed to emergency services from your account as described below. 

Placing 9-1-1 calls:  When you make a 9-1-1 emergency call, the VoIP service will attempt to automatically route your 9-1-1 call through a third-party service provider to a Public Safety Answering Point (“PSAP”).  Your call may be forwarded to a third-party specialized call center that handles emergency calls.  This call center is different from the PSAP that would answer a traditional 9-1-1 call, and consequently, you will be required to provide your name, address, and telephone number to the call center. 

How your information is provided:  The dispatcher receiving the call will not be able to capture or automatically retain your name, telephone number, or physical location as this information is not provided by you to TextMe.  Therefore, when making a 9-1-1 emergency call, you must immediately inform the dispatcher of your location (or the location of the emergency, if different), and any other relevant information as required by the dispatcher.  If you are unable to speak, the dispatcher may not be able to locate you if your location information is not up to date. 

Disconnections:  You must not disconnect the 9-1-1 emergency call until told to do so by the dispatcher, as the dispatcher may not have your number or contact information.  If you are inadvertently disconnected, you must call back immediately.

Connection time:  For technical reasons, including network congestion, it is possible that a 9-1-1 emergency call will produce a busy signal or will take longer to connect when compared with traditional 9-1-1 calls. 

9-1-1 calls may not function:  For technical reasons, the functionality of 9-1-1 VoIP emergency calls may cease or be curtailed in various circumstances, including, but not limited to:  failure of service or your service access device—if your system access equipment fails or is not configured correctly, or if your VoIP service is not functioning correctly for any reason, including power outages, VoIP service outage, suspension or disconnection of your service due to billing issues, network or Internet congestion, or network or Internet outage in the event of a power, network or Internet outage. 

You may need to reset or reconfigure the system access equipment before being able to use the VoIP service, including for 9-1-1 emergency calls. 

Alternate services: TextMe recommends that you terminate the VoIP services or consider an alternate means for accessing traditional 9-1-1 emergency services. 

Inform other users:  You are responsible for notifying, and you agree to notify, any user or potential users of your VoIP services of the nature and limitations of 9-1-1 emergency calls on the VoIP services as described herein. 

**TEXTING SERVICE – TEXT-TO-911 LIMITATIONS**

**Note that most consumers in the U.S. CANNOT access emergency 911 services by sending a text message from a phone. Even where it is possible to send a text message to emergency 911 services, it is preferable to place a call to emergency 911. Even if sending a text message to emergency 911 services is possible, the emergency call taker will not receive your location information automatically; instead, you will have to supply such information. If you attempt to send a text message to 911 and it cannot be processed, you will receive a “bounce back” message that the text message was not delivered.**

**PLEASE ALSO NOTE THAT THE OUTBOUND SERVICE SHOULD NOT BE USED TO PLACE EMERGENCY 911 CALLS AND IT IS A VIOLATION OF THESE T&Cs TO RELY ON THE OUTBOUND SERVICE FOR PLACING 911 CALLS. SEE OUTBOUND SERVICE (UNITED STATES) – NO 911 CALLING FUNCTIONALITY FOR MORE INFORMATION**

**OUTBOUND SERVICE AND TEXTING SERVICE (UNIVERSAL APPLICABILITY) – 911 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION**

Relying on the Outbound Service or Texting Service as an exclusive means for access to emergency services is a violation of these T&Cs. You acknowledge and agree that TextMe will not be liable for any service outage and/or inability to dial 9-1-1 using TextMe Products and Services or to access emergency service personnel due to the 9-1-1 dialing and messaging characteristics and limitations listed herein.  YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN, TEXTME, ITS AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, COMMERCIAL PARTNERS AND UNDERLYING CARRIERS (COLLECTIVELY, THE “TEXTME PARTIES”) WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIMS, DEMANDS, ACTIONS, INJURY, DEATH OR DAMAGE TO PERSONS OR PROPERTY, ARISING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY OUT OF, OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE PROVISION OR NON-PROVISION OF 9-1-1 AND/OR EMERGENCY 9-1-1 SERVICES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY INABILITY ON YOUR PART TO ACCESS 9-1-1 AND/OR EMERGENCY 9-1-1 SERVICES, DEFECTIVE ACCESS TO 9-1-1 SERVICES, INFERIOR ACCESS TO EMERGENCY SERVICES AS COMPARED WITH OTHER TYPES OF CALLING OR TEXT MESSAGING SERVICES OR OTHER PROVIDERS, DELAYED ACCESS TO 9-1-1 SERVICES, IMPAIRED ACCESS TO 9-1-1 SERVICES, OR BLOCKED ACCESS TO 9-1-1 SERVICES, AND YOU AGREE TO INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS THE TEXTME PARTIES, FROM ANY LIABILITIES, CLAIMS, DAMAGES, LOSSES ARISING DIRECTLY FROM THE PROVISION, INFERIOR OR DEFECTIVE PROVISION, OR NON-PROVISION OF 9-1-1 AND/OR EMERGENCY 9-1-1 SERVICE ASSOCIATED WITH THE OUTBOUND SERVICE AND THE TEXTING SERVICE.

**INBOUND SERVICE LIMITATIONS**

When you elect to subscribe to the Inbound Service, you may receive one telephone number attributed to your account by TextMe for the use of the Products and Services.  You agree to comply with all federal and state laws and regulations of the United States, as well as any law or regulation you may be subject to in any other country with respect to the use of the telephone number assigned to you by TextMe. 

You acknowledge and agree that the telephone number assigned to your account by TextMe may be ported outside of the Products and Services only with the explicit consent of TextMe and may not be ported. Number portability may result in additional fees being charged to your account.

TextMe may reclaim any telephone number it assigns to your account and discontinue its availability to you at any time and without liability whatsoever to TextMe.  Furthermore, in the event of termination or discontinuance of the Inbound Service for any reason, TextMe will reclaim, without notice and at no cost to TextMe, the telephone number associated with the Inbound Service account. 

**TEXTING SERVICE LIMITATIONS**

In certain countries, the Texting Service may enable TextMe users to send and receive SMS and MMS at no charge to TextMe users. We do not make any representations as to what occurs or is offered in other countries outside of the U.S.

**ADDITIONAL LIMITATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE OUTBOUND SERVICE, INBOUND SERVICE AND TEXTING SERVICE**

You acknowledge the right for TextMe to suspend all or part of the Outbound Service, Inbound Service or Texting Service at no liability to TextMe if your usage of TextMe Products and Services is inconsistent with normal use. Normal use will be determined by TextMe in a manner relevant to each separate service offering and subject to TextMe’s sole discretion. In some, but not all, cases, this may mean that services are measured compared to other TextMe users, to industry-wide averages or norms, or to traffic patterns consistent with human as opposed to machine operation. However, TextMe reserves the right to evaluate what it considers normal use according to any single or number of factors and in its sole discretion according to the disclosed or other factors. 

If We determine that your usage violates these T&Cs or other User Agreements with respect to usage limitations, we may: (a) notify you of the excessive use and demand that it cease immediately, and (b) unilaterally suspend temporarily or indefinitely your access to and use of the relevant service or to all Product and Services where TextMe shall not be liable for any costs, losses or other liabilities associated with such suspension; or (c) demand payment for such usage. 

**RIGHT TO IMPOSE FEES OR CHARGES** 

TextMe reserves the right to charge for its Products and Services in its sole discretion. TextMe reserves the right to change pricing and modify or discontinue any of its Products and Services, at any time and without notice. TextMe commits to notify you of the pricing at the time and before completion of purchase. By using the Products and Services, you are accepting the rates charged at the time of use.

**PAYMENTS AND ACCOUNTS**

In order to use TextMe Products and Services, you will be required to provide data about yourself (thereafter “Account Data”), including but not limited to your name, telephone number, email address, location, device type, and a password that you create.  It is your responsibility to keep your Account Data safe, secure, and confidential. It is your responsibility to select a password that is secure and strong.  We recommend choosing a password that is difficult for others to predict by creating an unlikely combination of letters, numbers, and symbols, and that is unique from other passwords you may use online.

You represent that any Account Data you provide is true, complete, accurate, and is not fraudulent.  You commit to update your Account Data as necessary. You acknowledge and agree that TextMe may unilaterally suspend your access to Our Products and Services, temporarily or indefinitely and at any time and in our sole discretion, if We suspect the provided Account Information is false, incomplete, or inaccurate, or if We suspect fraudulent use of such Account Information.

You consent to the disclosure of any such Account Information, Content or other information related to your use of Our Products and Services. See TextMe’s [Privacy Policy](http://api.textme-app.com/api/support/privacy-policy/android/).

TextMe is not responsible for the security of your Account Data or unauthorized or fraudulent use of your Account Data. In the case of any unauthorized use of your Account Data, including if the device from which you use the Products and Services is lost or stolen, you agree to notify TextMe of such occurrence immediately upon becoming aware.

When credits used with the Outbound Service, Inbound Service or Texting Service, such credits are applied and charged in increments of one minute, and are rounded up to the next minute regardless of what portion of the next higher minute is consumed.

The Inbound Service and Outbound Service are separately offered and subject to independent payment terms. We do not offer any payment plans where discounts or other favorable pricing is offered to users that subscribe to both the Inbound Service and Outbound Service. Instead, each service offering is independent of the other though you may elect independently to combine such offerings.

**OUTBOUND SERVICE AND TEXTING SERVICE PAYMENT TERMS**

Per call or per text fees will be displayed at the time of using the Outbound Service or the Texting Service.

In certain cases, our Outbound Service may offer unlimited outbound calls. Calls to Hawaii, Alaska, and some specific carriers or territories may be excluded from unlimited outbound calling offers. Any such limitations will be disclosed in connection with the relevant offer.

The Outbound Service and the Texting Service may be limited, suspended, blocked or restricted by geography, number, duration, or other criteria as determined solely by TextMe at any time and in its sole discretion.

**SUBSCRIPTIONS**

We may offer our Products and Services via subscription billing. 

Subscriptions will be offered in periodic intervals of time such as one week, one month, or one year.  The subscription interval will be displayed when you confirm your subscription.  After you confirm your subscription, the subscription will automatically renew on a periodic basis until canceled.

In order to cancel your subscription, you must login to the App Store or iTunes (for iOS users), or the Google Play Store (for Android users), or the Amazon Appstore (for Kindle users).  Once you have subscribed, you cannot cancel your subscription from within our Products and Services.

Subscriptions are billed on a prepaid basis.  Each auto-renewal of a subscription is an acceptance of the terms of the subscription for the prepaid period.   If you cancel your subscription, your access will end at the end of the prepaid period.  Subscriptions cannot be refunded or pro-rated.

If you have any questions regarding your subscription, please contact us at [contact@go-text.me](mailto:contact@go-text.me)**.**

**FRAUDULENT CHARGES**

In the United States, we offer various enhanced Services for purchase.  In the event that you elect to make a purchase, your payment will be processed by the App Store or iTunes (for iOS users), or the Google Play Store (for Android users), or the Amazon Appstore (for Kindle users).  TextMe does not process payments, nor does TextMe store credit card numbers on Our servers for any purpose.  TextMe is not responsible for fraudulent use of your credit card under any circumstances.  Should a fraudulent charge be made with your Account Information, TextMe is not responsible to provide refunds. Please contact your credit card issuer, or the app store where you made your purchase (Google Play Store, Apple App Store, or the Amazon App Store). As between TextMe and you, you are responsible for any fraudulent use of the Products and Services.

**MODIFICATIONS TO AND TERMINATION OF ALL OR PART OF THE SERVICES**

TextMe reserves the right, without any liability of any kind to TextMe, to modify, block or terminate all or part of the Products and Services provided by TextMe to you at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice.
