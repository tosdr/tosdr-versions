Read our full [Privacy Policy](#top)  
Questions, comments, concerns? Please reach out: [privacy@woebothealth.com](mailto:privacy@woebothealth.com)

#### Commitment 1: What you write to Woebot is private

The transcripts of your conversations with Woebot are not shared with third parties, except to provide the Services, improve the Services, or [to protect us and others](#Disclosures%20To%20Protect%20Us%20or%20Others%3F).

#### Commitment 2: We never sell or share your personal data with advertisers 

Never have, never will. 

#### Commitment 3: You control your personal data

Request to access it, correct it, or delete it, whenever you want. Share as much or as little as you like. See: [How Can I Control My Personal Data?](#How%20Can%20I%20Control%20My%20Personal%20Data%3F)

#### Commitment 4: We always collect personal data with specific purpose and intent

For example, we ask about your symptoms to help you reflect on your progress, customize your experience, and in some [partner programs](#Partner%20Programs%3F) to inform your clinical care. See: [What Personal Data Do You Collect & How Is It Used?](#What%20Personal%20Data%20Do%20You%20Collect%20%26%20How%20Is%20It%20Used%3F)

#### Commitment 5: We are upfront about who can see which personal data and why

For example, some technical service providers use personal data to help make the Services work. If you use Woebot through a clinical partner, it may be appropriate to share more personal data with them than with an employer or other partner. We’ll always be transparent about who sees what.

Do You Share My Personal Data?
------------------------------

We do not share your personal data with third parties except as outlined below.

#### Service providers

We use third party service providers, like Amazon Web Services, that help us provide our Services. These third parties may have limited and controlled access to personal data in connection with the services they provide such as hosting or customer service. The use of personal data by service providers outside of agreed-upon service they provide is prohibited.

#### Partner programs​

We may partner with organizations to conduct research studies or provide you with the Services through separate programs. 

Program partners may include employers, hospitals, providers, or other medical and academic partners. Clinical partner programs are a specific type of partner program that include a licensed healthcare provider.

Your participation in partner programs is optional and requires your agreement with our partner for any personal data to be shared with a partner. Participation may be governed by additional terms outside this privacy policy. If you choose to participate in a partner program, 

We will not share:

* Your conversational interactions with Woebot, like what you write or your path through a conversation, unless you give us your consent to do so

We often share:

* De-identified and/or aggregated data about how Woebot users use the app and its effectiveness

If you are using the Services through a clinical program or as part of a study and you consent, we may also share:

* Identifiable data about how you’re doing such as survey responses, mood trends, or your confirmation that Woebot has understood a concerning entry that’s beyond what it can support

The personal data we may share “For clinical partner programs (if enrolled)” and “For non-clinical partner programs (if enrolled),” is indicated in: [What Personal Data Do You Col](#What%20Personal%20Data%20Do%20You%20Collect%20%26%20How%20Is%20It%20Used%3F)[lect & How Is It Used](http://What%20Personal%20Data%20Do%20You%20Collect%20%26%20How%20Is%20It%20Used%3F).

Please note that any personal data shared with a partner program is also subject to the partner program’s terms and privacy policy. We are not responsible for the processing of personal data by partner programs. Please contact the partner program if you have any questions about their documents or practices. For research programs, please see the study’s informed consent. You may also contact the study and/or its institutional review board (IRB).

#### Your interactions with third-party services

Our Services may link to third parties, like helplines or other resources. Any information shared with or otherwise collected by third parties is subject to the third party’s terms and privacy policy. We are not responsible for the processing of personal data by third parties relevant to these resources.

#### De-identified and/or aggregated data

We may use your personal data to create de-identified and/or aggregated data, like approximate location information, information about the device you use to access our Services, information about conversational trends, or other analyses we create. De-identified and/or aggregated data is not personal data and we may use and share this data as permitted by applicable law, such as with academic partners. We never share your transcripts with Woebot without your consent, even de-identified.

#### Disclosures to protect us or others  

We may access, preserve, and disclose any personal data we store associated with you to external parties if we, in good faith, believe doing so is required or appropriate to:

* Comply with law enforcement or national security requests and legal process, such as court order or subpoena;
* Protect you, our, or others’ rights, property, or safety;
* Enforce our policies or contracts; or
* Assist with an investigation or prosecution of suspected or actual illegal activity

#### Transferring personal data outside of the country you reside in or are currently located

Your personal data may be transferred, stored, and processed in one or more countries outside of the country you reside in or are currently located in, which may have data protection laws that are different from the laws where you reside or are currently located. When processing personal data outside of the country you reside or are currently located in, we take additional steps in an effort to ensure our international transfer of personal data is consistent with applicable law.  
  
If we transfer personal data which originates in the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and/or the United Kingdom to a country that has not been found to provide an adequate level of protection under applicable data protection laws, one of the safeguards we may use to support such transfer is the [EU Standard Contractual Clauses](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc/standard-contractual-clauses-international-transfers_en).

If you have additional questions about our international transfers of personal data, please [Contact Us](#Contact%20Us).

#### Disclosure in the event of merger, sale, or other asset transfers

If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financial due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, purchase or sale of assets, or transition of service to another provider, your information may be sold or transferred as part of such a transaction, as permitted by law and/or contract.

How is My Personal Data Protected?
----------------------------------

We use commercially reasonable efforts to implement security measures that are designed to avoid accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access to personal data. This may include (as appropriate):

* We adhere to hospital-level security policies and procedures to protect sensitive user data, adhering to the HIPAA rules, including the Privacy and Security Rules
* Using cloud-enabled infrastructure designed to reduce our data footprint
* Encrypting all personal data at rest and in transit
* Securing sensitive personal data in a dedicated environment in a manner designed to ensure segregation and clear access control
* Using technical network controls like multi-factor authentication and deny-all/allow-by-exception in a manner designed to maintain controlled access
* Conducting and responding to penetration tests, vulnerability assessments, code reviews, and internal compliance reviews
* Maintaining our business continuity, disaster recovery, and incident response plans
* Allowing employees to access personal data only if required in connection to their job duties

Despite these efforts, no security measures are perfect, and no method of data transmission or storage is guaranteed to prevent unauthorized disclosure or misuse. As a result, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any personal data you provide to us. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we do not accept liability for unauthorized access, use, disclosure, or loss of personal data.

We retain the personal data we collect for as long as you use our Services, or as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected, provide our Services, resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue legitimate business purposes, enforce our agreements, and comply with applicable laws.
