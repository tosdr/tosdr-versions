12. Moderation of the Contents, restrictions imposed on the User and complaints
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**12.1** In order to safeguard the digital environment of the Platform and the Site, and to allow activities to be conducted in compliance with applicable law, Arduino may take non-automated initiatives to detect, identify and counteract illegal content (i.e., information that does not comply with European Union law or any Member State's law that complies with European Union law) and information that is incompatible with this Agreement.

Moreover, for the same purposes, as part of the provision of intermediary services (i.e., with reference to the “Forum” and “Project Hub” sections of the Site), Arduino set up a mechanism to allow Users \- as well as other persons or entities \- to electronically report (“**Reports**”) the presence on the Platform of information that is believed to constitute illegal content or is in violation of this Agreement (“**Reporting Mechanism**”).

**12.2** The Reporting Mechanism may be activated:

1. directly through the content in question;

2. through the “Reporting Violations” section available at \[insert link\];

by filling in all the required fields with a view to submitting sufficiently precise and adequately reasoned Reports that allow Arduino to acquire effective knowledge or awareness to identify the illegality of the relevant activity or information without detailed legal examination.

**12.3** After sending the Report, to which a unique identification number will be attributed, Arduino will send an acknowledgement of receipt to the person making the Report and will inform them without undue delay and in a proportionate manner of its decision (which will be based on the information provided by the person making the Report and on the provisions of the applicable law).

**12.4** For the purposes of assessing and deciding on Reports, Arduino shall give priority to Reports submitted by trustworthy reporters, as recognised by the Italian Communications Authority (AGCOM) and resulting from the public list kept by said Authority.

**12.5** With reference to possible breaches or infringements carried out by the User, without prejudice to Arduino's right to send prior warnings:

1. in case of sharing of the Account Credentials with a third party (Section 2.2), Arduino may delete and close the Account of the User;

2. in case of a breach of the provisions of Section 2.3 (relating to User's Account information), Arduino may suspend the User’s registration or Account until the issue is resolved, or suspend the Account (if already registered) until a username that does not infringe this Agreement or applicable law is used;

3. in case of breach of the obligations related to the use of the Platform and the Site (Section 3.2), as well as of infringement of Arduino's rights (Section 7.2), Arduino may suspend the User's Account or, based on the seriousness of the conduct, delete and close the User's Account;

4. in the event that User uploads Content in breach of this Agreement (Section 5.2), including with respect to third party rights, Arduino may delete the relevant Content and, based on the severity of the conduct, suspend User's Account. In the event of repeated uploads of Content in violation of this Agreement, Arduino may also delete and terminate your Account;

5. in case of infringement by the User of third parties' intellectual or industrial property rights, according to the provisions of Section 8, or of provisions set forth by the applicable law, Arduino reserves the right to suspend the User's Account or, based on the seriousness of the conduct, delete and close the User's Account.

**12.6** The restrictions adopted by Arduino shall be without prejudice to Arduino's right to seek recourse to judicial remedies or alternative dispute resolution.

**12.7** If a restriction is imposed on the User, Arduino will provide the User with a statement of reasons no later than the date from which the restriction is imposed. The statement of reasons will contain the following information:

1. the type and duration (if applicable) of the restriction imposed (e.g. content removal, Account suspension or Account deletion);

2. an indication of the circumstances on which the decision was based (including, if applicable, an indication of whether the decision was based on a third-party report or pursuant to a direct initiative by Arduino);

3. if applicable, an indication of whether the content was identified by, or the decision was made with the aid of, automated tools;

4. a reference to the statutory provision or clause of this Agreement that is alleged to have been violated, including an explanation of the grounds for the decision;

5. an indication of the remedies available to the User (in the absence of any indication, the User may refer to the following).

**12.8** The User is entitled to use the complaints management system (“**Complaints**”) to challenge the decisions (“**Decisions**”) adopted by Arduino:

1. resulting from the receipt of a Report through the Reporting Mechanism;

2. indicating (to the extent applicable) whether to:

a. remove Content or disable access to it or restrict its visibility;

b. suspend or terminate in whole or in part the provision of services to the User;

c. suspend or terminate the User's account;

d. suspend, terminate or otherwise limit the ability to monetise the information provided by the User.

The internal system for handling Complaints can be activated, by sending an email to [DSA@arduino.cc](mailto:DSA@arduino.cc), within 6 (six) months from the day the Decision is communicated.

Arduino shall communicate its reasoned decision regarding a Complaint without undue delay, also highlighting the possibility of recourse to out-of-court dispute resolution procedures.

**12.9** After issuing a prior notice, Arduino may suspend for a reasonable period of time:

1. the provision of services to Users who frequently submit manifestly illegal Content;

2. the processing of Reports and Complaints filed by persons, entities or complainants who frequently submit manifestly unfounded Reports or Complaints.

For the purpose of evaluating a suspension, Arduino will assess \- on a case-by-case basis and in a timely, diligent and objective manner \- whether the User, person, entity or complainant is committing abuse, taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances that are apparent from the information available to Arduino and that will include, at a minimum:

a. the number, in absolute terms, of manifestly illegal content or manifestly unfounded Reports or Complaints filed within a given timeframe

b. the relative proportion in relation to the total number of information or Complaints filed within a given time frame;

c. the seriousness of the abuse, including the nature of the illegal contents, and the relevant consequences;

d. where identifiable, the intention of the user, person, entity or complainant.

**12.10** The User has the right to refer to alternative disputes resolution entities certified by the Italian Communications Authority (“AGCOM”) in case of disputes related to Decisions and Complaints that could not be resolved through the above system. Arduino undertakes to refer to such certified bodies in good faith in order to resolve the dispute, without prejudice to Arduino's right to refuse to refer to the same certified bodies in the event of a dispute that has already been resolved as well as in the other cases envisaged by the regulations in force.

**12.11** This Section 12.11 shall only apply to the extent the Digital Millenium Copyright Act is applicable.

Arduino respects third parties’ intellectual property rights and expects Users to do the same. Arduino will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable law and are properly. Without prejudice to the above, if you believe that copyright on work has been infringed by a User, please provide us (at [trademark@arduino.cc](mailto:trademark@arduino.cc)) with the following information:

(i) a physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a person authorized to act on their behalf; (ii) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed; (iii) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material; (iv) your contact information, including your address, telephone number, and an email address; (v) a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; (vi) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and, under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.

13. Miscellaneous
-----------------

**13.1** If the User is acting as a consumer who ordinarily resides in a member state of the European Union, this Agreement shall be governed by the law of that country and any actions or disputes shall be submitted to the jurisdiction of the competent court in that country in the place where the User consumer has their residence or domicile.

In any other case, except in case any mandatory provision provides otherwise, this Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with laws of Italy.

14. Dispute Resolution for Users located in the United States
-------------------------------------------------------------

This Section 14 shall only be applicable to Users located in the United States of America (USA)

**14.1 Informal Dispute Resolution**

We try to address any disputes without the need to initiate a formal legal case. You agree that prior to submitting any dispute or claim to arbitration for resolution, you and we agree to make a good faith effort to resolve it informally, including having at least one telephone or videoconference conversation between you, personally, and us. To initiate this good faith effort to informally resolve a dispute you agree to notify us in writing by email at [legal@arduino.cc](mailto:legal@arduino.cc), of the nature of the dispute, the basis for your claims and the resolution that you are seeking, including any monetary amount, with as much detail as you can provide so that we can gain a sufficient understanding of the dispute. Within the sixty (60) days following our receipt of this notice, you agree to engage in good faith efforts to resolve the dispute, including personally participating in a telephone call or videoconference with us. You may have a lawyer attend the call with you if you wish. If the dispute is not resolved within that sixty (60) days (which period can be extended by agreement of the parties), you or we may commence proceedings as set out in this Agreement to resolve the dispute consistent with the process set forth below. Compliance with and completing this informal dispute resolution process is a condition precedent to commencing an arbitration. You and we agree to toll any applicable statute of limitations and filing fee deadlines while the parties engage in this informal dispute resolution process from the date we receive your notice to the date an action is commenced or the conclusion of the 60-day period described above, whichever is sooner. A court of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority to enforce this condition precedent, which includes the power to enjoin the filing or prosecution of a demand for arbitration.

**14.2 Arbitration Agreement & Waiver of Certain Rights**

You and Arduino agree that, except as set forth below, we will resolve any controversies, claims, counterclaims, or other disputes between you and Arduino or you and a third-party agent of Arduino (“**Claim**”) through final and binding arbitration instead of through court proceedings in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“**AAA Rules**”). This arbitration agreement applies to any existing or future Claims that you have not individually filed in a court of law or in arbitration prior to the date you agreed to this Agreement. The AAA Rules are available at [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/) or by calling 1-800-778-7879. You and we hereby waive any right to a jury trial of any Claim. The arbitration will be heard and determined by a single arbitrator. The arbitrator's decision in any such arbitration will be final and binding upon the parties and may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties agree that the arbitration proceedings will be kept confidential and that the existence of the proceeding and any element of it (including, without limitation, any pleadings, briefs or other documents submitted or exchanged and any testimony or other oral submissions and awards) will not be disclosed beyond the arbitration proceedings, except as may lawfully be required in judicial proceedings relating to the arbitration by applicable disclosure rules and regulations of securities regulatory authorities or other governmental agencies, or as specifically permitted by state law. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement. A court of competent jurisdiction has exclusive authority to determine the existence, scope, and validity of the arbitration agreement and the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim, including, without limitation, whether any conditions precedent to the commencement of an arbitration have been completely satisfied and any objections with respect to any of the foregoing.

To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send us an individual letter signed by you requesting arbitration and describing your claim at Arduino S.r.l., [legal@arduino.cc](mailto:legal@arduino.cc), Attention: Legal Department. This letter must be sent at least ten (10) days before you initiate an arbitration proceeding against us.

Any party to the arbitration may at any time serve an offer of compromise in writing upon any other party to the action. Offers of compromise pursuant to these Agreement will be adjudicated and interpreted in accordance with California Code of Civil Procedure section 998.

If you demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Arduino will pay as much of the administrative costs and arbitrator's fees required for the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the cost of the arbitration from being prohibitive. In the final award, the arbitrator may apportion the costs of arbitration and the compensation of the arbitrator among the parties in such amounts as the arbitrator deems appropriate.

This arbitration agreement does not preclude you or Arduino from seeking action by federal, state, or local government agencies. You and Arduino also have the right to bring qualifying claims in small claims court or transfer qualifying claims to small claims court. Either party may elect that a Claim be filed exclusively in a small claims court of competent jurisdiction by providing notice to the other party. In the event a Claim has already been filed in arbitration, the party who has filed that Claim will, within ten (10) days of receiving such a notice, withdraw their Claim from arbitration. The parties will then proceed with the Claim exclusively in small claims court. A party may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce the terms of this paragraph. In addition, you and Arduino retain the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for provisional relief, including pre-arbitral attachments or preliminary injunctions. Any such request shall not be deemed incompatible with this Agreement, nor a waiver of the right to have disputes submitted to arbitration as provided in this Agreement.

Neither you nor Arduino may act as a class representative or private attorney general, nor participate as a member of a class of claimants, with respect to any Claim. You may not bring Claims in arbitration on a class or representative basis. The arbitrator can decide only your and/or Arduino’ individual Claims.

If any provision of this Section is found to be invalid or unenforceable, then that specific provision shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed, but the remainder of this Section shall continue in full force and effect. If for any reason a Claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and Arduino each waive any right to a jury trial. No waiver of any provision of this Section of this Agreement will be effective or enforceable unless recorded in a writing signed by the party waiving such a right or requirement. Such a waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Agreement. The arbitrator may award in the arbitration the same damages or other relief available under applicable law, including injunctive and declaratory relief, as if the action were brought in court on an individual basis. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing or herein, the arbitrator may not issue a “public injunction” and any such “public injunction” may be awarded only by a federal or state court. If either party seeks a “public injunction,” all other claims and prayers for relief must be adjudicated in arbitration first and any prayer or claim for a “public injunction” in federal or state court stayed until the arbitration is completed, after which the federal or state court can adjudicate the party’s claim or prayer for “public injunctive relief.” In doing so, the federal or state court is bound under principles of claim or issue preclusion by the decision of the arbitrator.

This Arbitration Agreement Section of the Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Arduino.

THIS SECTION LIMITS CERTAIN RIGHTS, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO MAINTAIN A COURT ACTION, THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY FORM OF CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE CLAIM, THE RIGHT TO ENGAGE IN DISCOVERY EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN AAA RULES, AND THE RIGHT TO CERTAIN REMEDIES AND FORMS OF RELIEF. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU OR ARDUINO WOULD HAVE IN COURT ALSO MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.

_Mass Arbitration Process Requirements_

If twenty-five (25) or more similar claims are asserted against Arduino at or around the same time by the same or coordinated counsel or are otherwise coordinated (and your Claim is one such claim) (“**Mass Arbitration**”), you understand and agree that the resolution of your Claim might be delayed. You also agree to the following process and application of the AAA Multiple Consumer Case Filing Fee Schedule and Supplementary Rules. Regardless of the provisions in the arbitration agreement above about the prohibitive costs of individual arbitration for you, if your lawyer or their business partner is directly or indirectly paying or advancing the arbitration fees and costs in a mass arbitration on your behalf, the Process Arbitrator shall have discretion to determine whether the total arbitration fees and costs due to AAA should be split evenly between the claimants, on the one hand, and us, on the other hand. The Process Arbitrator shall make or confirm this discretionary decision before the initiation of each batch, as set out below. In the final decision, the arbitrator can reevaluate and divide the arbitration fees and costs among the parties in amounts they see fit to ensure a fair division among the parties. Twenty (20) claims shall be selected to proceed to individual arbitration proceedings as part of a first batching process, ten (10) of which will be selected by the claimants and ten (10) of which will be selected by Arduino. The remaining claims shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration nor shall any AAA fees be assessed in connection with those claims until they are selected to proceed to individual arbitration proceedings as part of the staged process described herein. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining claims after the conclusion of the initial twenty (20) proceedings, the parties shall participate in a global mediation session before a retired state or federal court judge, for which Arduino will pay the mediator's fee. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining claims through mediation at this time, then forty (40) claims shall be selected to proceed to individual arbitration proceedings as part of a second batching process, twenty (20) of which will be selected by the claimants and twenty (20) of which will be selected by Arduino. (If there are fewer than forty (40) claims remaining, all shall proceed.) The remaining claims shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration nor shall any AAA fees be assessed in connection with those claims until they are selected to proceed to individual arbitration proceedings as part of the staged process described herein. In any batching process, a single arbitrator shall preside over each proceeding, and only one proceeding may be assigned to each arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining claims after the conclusion of the forty (40) proceedings, the parties shall participate in another global mediation session before a retired state or federal court judge, for which Arduino will pay the mediator's fee. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining claims in mediation at this time, this staged process shall continue with no more than one hundred (100) claims proceeding at any time in a staged order that is selected randomly or by the AAA, until all the coordinated claims, including your Claim, are adjudicated or otherwise resolved. At any time during these proceedings, we agree to participate in a global mediation session should your counsel request it in an effort to resolve all remaining claims. Any applicable statute of limitations on your Claims and filing fee deadlines shall be tolled for claims subject to this section regarding “Mass Arbitration Process Requirements” from the time claims are selected for the first set of batching proceedings until the time your Claim is selected to proceed in arbitration, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved. A court of competent jurisdiction shall have authority to enforce this section regarding “Mass Arbitration Process Requirements” and, if necessary, to enjoin the filing or prosecution of arbitration demands against Arduino Should a court of competent jurisdiction decline to enforce these “Mass Arbitration Process Requirements,” you and we agree that your and our counsel shall engage in good faith and with the assistance of a Process Arbitrator to devise and implement procedures that ensure that arbitration remains efficient and cost-effective for all parties. Either party may engage with the AAA to address reductions in arbitration fees.
