Minors
------

With regard to the processing of personal data of children under 16 years of age, please read the following information. In any event, Arduino does not process personal data of children under the age of 14. In case Arduino recognizes that it has collected personal information from users under the age of 14, Arduino will take steps to delete such information as soon as possible. Students under the age of 14 who are involved in using Arduino Education products will not be identified, as they will be given unique and anonymous access credentials that only the teacher will give to the students under the age of 14, whose browsing data will not be visible to Arduino anyways.

Arduino cares about the security of its website and its services, particularly when minors under the age of 16 are accessing it.

Therefore, Arduino has expressly stated that some of the services provided through its website are only accessible to certain users, and at the same time, has provided for different types of registration to its website, depending on the age group, in order to better protect browsing and use of services through its website by users under 16.

Users under the age of 14 may create a Junior Account. Arduino does not process any personal data that would allow you to be identified as a child under the age of 14.

In order to create a Junior Account, the user is asked to choose a username and a picture (an Avatar), from a set of predetermined options, as well as to enter a password of their choice. As with all users who create an account on the website, the user is also asked to enter his/her date of birth, also to verify that he/she can correctly proceed with the creation of a Junior Account.

In order to complete the registration of a Junior Account, Arduino will process the personal data of the person exercising parental authority, such as their email address entered during the creation of the Junior Account, and will ask him/her to create an Arduino Adult Account (users over 16 years old). If you do not provide such personal data or if you do not create an Adult Account (users over 16 years old), the Junior Account will not be created and all data provided will be deleted within 30 days. The personal data of the person exercising parental authority are therefore processed in order to allow the creation of the Junior Account and will be kept for the entire period of activity of the account, which will in any event be deleted (both with regard to the Junior Account and the Adult Account) in case of inactivity for 24 months.

The personal data collected within the Junior Account, and therefore only those relating to the person exercising parental authority, who created an Adult Account (users over 16 years old), will be processed in order to allow access to all services and features on Arduino website. The purposes, the legal basis and the retention periods are indicated in this Privacy Policy in the dedicated sections, which you should visit, please.

For more information on the recipients of the personal data of the person exercising parental authority, on any transfers outside the EU of such personal data as well as to know the rights recognized to data subjects under the GDPR, please see the previous sections of our Privacy Policy.

With a Junior Account, the user will only be able to:

* Access Educational products and services intended for middle school students (view full list on [Arduino Education](https://www.arduino.cc/education))
* Download and use Arduino IDE.
* Download and use the Arduino Science Journal App. Use the Science Journal Apps only for creating experiments saved locally in the App. Sharing functionality with Google Drive is not made available to Junior Accounts

#### Third Party Service Providers used in relation to Minors

#### Adult Account (for users between 14 and 16 years old)

Arduino processes personal data of users between 14 and 16 years old when they create an Adult Account on the website.

In particular, Arduino processes the user's email address as well as his/her username and password and his/her date of birth, to verify that he/she can proceed with the creation of a Adult Account. The legal basis for this processing is to follow up on the user's request to create a Adult Account. The data retention period is equal to the period of activity of the account for the use of Arduino services according to the terms and conditions of use that you have accepted, within the limits described.

Just as for the Junior Account, for the Adult Account of users between 14 and 16 years old, in order to complete the registration of a Adult Account, Arduino will process the personal data of the person exercising parental authority as well, who will be asked to enter his/her email address and create a username and password. If you do not provide us with your personal data or if you do not create a Adult Account (users over 16 years old), you will not be able to create this account.

The personal data of the person exercising parental authority are therefore processed in order to allow the creation of the Adult Account as well as the management of the account itself, in terms of preferences and access to the services and will be stored for the entire period of activity of the account, which in any case will be deleted (both the Adult Account of the user between 14 and 16 years old and the Adult Account of the user over 16 years old) in case of inactivity of the same for 24 months.

Through the Adult Account of users between 14 and 16 years old, the user has access to all the services available on the Arduino website, except for those services/features expressly reserved for the person exercising parental authority set forth below. Only the person exercising parental authority may choose which services would be activated and which services the child between 14 and 16 years old can access.

Personal data of the person exercising parental authority of a user between 14 and 16 years old who has an Adult Account may be processed for the following purposes.

* To send essential information relating to your account and your use of Arduino products and services.
* To participate in our surveys.
* For marketing purposes.
* For more information on the legal basis and retention period please view our Privacy Policy.

For more information on the [legal basis and retention period](#why-and-for-how-long-we-process-your-data) please view our Privacy Policy.

For the purposes described above, Arduino does not process personal data of users between 14 and 16 years old.

Such data may be processed, if the person exercising parental authority provides his/her prior authorization through the dashboard, only for the following purposes.

* To ask information and to interact with other users.
* To obtain an Arduino certification.
* To enable the use of Arduino Education products.
* To publish software to which the user is a contributor.
* To interact with customer care operators.
* To publish data of the user on Arduino website as an “Arduino Certified User”.
