Adult Account (for users between 14 and 16 years old)
-----------------------------------------------------

Arduino processes personal data of users between 14 and 16 years old when they create an Adult Account on the website.

In particular, Arduino processes the user's email address as well as his/her username and password and his/her date of birth, to verify that he/she can proceed with the creation of a Adult Account. The legal basis for this processing is to follow up on the user's request to create a Adult Account. The data retention period is equal to the period of activity of the account for the use of Arduino services according to the terms and conditions of use that you have accepted, within the limits described.

Just as for the Junior Account, for the Adult Account of users between 14 and 16 years old, in order to complete the registration of a Adult Account, Arduino will process the personal data of the person exercising parental authority as well, who will be asked to enter his/her email address and create a username and password. If you do not provide us with your personal data or if you do not create a Adult Account (users over 16 years old), you will not be able to create this account.

The personal data of the person exercising parental authority are therefore processed in order to allow the creation of the Adult Account as well as the management of the account itself, in terms of preferences and access to the services and will be stored for the entire period of activity of the account, which in any case will be deleted (both the Adult Account of the user between 14 and 16 years old and the Adult Account of the user over 16 years old) in case of inactivity of the same for 24 months.

Through the Adult Account of users between 14 and 16 years old, the user has access to all the services available on the Arduino website, except for those services/features expressly reserved for the person exercising parental authority set forth below. Only the person exercising parental authority may choose which services would be activated and which services the child between 14 and 16 years old can access.

Personal data of the person exercising parental authority of a user between 14 and 16 years old who has an Adult Account may be processed for the following purposes.

* To send essential information relating to your account and your use of Arduino products and services.
    
* To participate in our surveys.
    

For more information on the [legal basis and retention period](https://www.arduino.cc/en/privacy-policy#why-and-for-how-long-we-process-your-data) please view our Privacy Policy.

For the purposes described above, Arduino does not process personal data of users between 14 and 16 years old.

Such data may be processed, if the person exercising parental authority provides his/her prior authorization through the dashboard, only for the following purposes.

* To ask information and to interact with other users.
    
* To obtain an Arduino certification.
    
* To enable the use of Arduino Education products.
    
* To publish software to which the user is a contributor.
    
* To interact with customer care operators.
    
* To publish data of the user on Arduino website as an “Arduino Certified User”.
