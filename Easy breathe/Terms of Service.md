### How does easybreathe.com verify insurance coverage?

The Check Your Insurance link opens a Typeform that collects your insurance information. This feature is optional. You can also fill out the “Check Your Insurance Coverage Today” form. These forms collect your first and last name, email address, phone number, zip code, and insurance carrier. You may be given the choice to complete your sign-up online, which prompts you to enter your Insurance Member ID and date of birth, or submit the form immediately, in which case you will be called to obtain that information.

Once we have your complete insurance information, it is verified by one of our team members. You will then receive an email and/or phone call letting you know that we have your coverage information and are ready to discuss it with you. If we do not receive a response, we may send your basic coverage summary to you via email.

Insurance Adjusted Carts: We may send you a hyperlink to access an “insurance-adjusted cart,” where items covered by your insurance are marked as "Free." This indicates there is no charge to you for these items, with the exception of any applicable coinsurance and deductible amounts, which will be presented

You hereby agree to release service provider, its affiliates and third-party service providers, and each of their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed (“claims”), arising out of or in any way connected with your use of this site.

### Indemnity

### What governing law applies?

These Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of California, without reference to their rules regarding conflicts of law. Subject to and without waiving the arbitration agreement below, the proper venue for any judicial action arising out of, relating to, or in connection with this Agreement will be the state and federal courts located in Los Angeles, California (a “Court of Competent Jurisdiction”). You and Easy Breathe stipulate to, and agree to waive any objection to, the personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts and submit to extraterritorial service or process.

[](https://www.easybreathe.com/Terms-and-Conditions-3.html#top) 

### What is the dispute resolution policy?

This section governs any dispute between you and Easy Breathe, and how that dispute will be legally resolved, if necessary. Remember, these dispute resolution provisions apply to disputes between Easy Breathe and you, and not to disputes between you and any other third party.

**Arbitration:** If you and Easy Breathe cannot resolve a dispute or other claim through negotiations, the dispute or claim shall be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. This arbitration agreement is reciprocal, and any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other(s). The language in this Agreement shall be interpreted in accordance with its fair meaning and not strictly for or against either party. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this agreement to arbitrate.

The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted through JAMS (www.jamsadr.com) under the Streamlined Rules, as modified by this agreement to arbitrate. All remedies available to the parties under applicable federal, state, or local laws shall remain available in arbitration. The parties shall each participate in the selection of a neutral arbitrator pursuant to the Streamlined Rules. Unless you and Easy Breathe agree otherwise in writing, the final arbitration hearing shall take place in person at the JAMS facility located in or nearest to your city of residence. If you initiate arbitration against us, you will be required to pay an initial fee of $250 (unless you qualify for a waiver), and all other arbitration costs (including any remaining JAMS Case Management Fee and all professional fees for the arbitrator’s services) shall be paid as determined by the arbitrator. If we initiate arbitration against you, we will pay all costs associated with the arbitration. If JAMS is unavailable to arbitrate a dispute or claim, you and Easy Breathe agree to arbitrate using an alternative arbitral forum. Regardless of the outcome of the arbitration, you and Easy Breathe will each pay your own attorneys’ fees and costs unless an award of attorneys’ fees is available under applicable statute. The arbitrator’s award will consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim. The award will also provide a concise written statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Either party may litigate to compel arbitration in a Court of Competent Jurisdiction, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to modify, confirm, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

**_You acknowledge that without this provision, you would have the right to sue in court with a jury trial._**

**Class Action Waiver:** You and Easy Breathe agree that any arbitration or other legal action shall be limited to the two of us as parties, and any joinder of other parties is not allowed. This means that **you cannot participate in any sort of representative proceeding against Easy Breathe, including as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action.**

**Equitable Relief:** There are things an arbitrator cannot do, like order a party to act or stop doing something—this is known as “equitable relief.” Either one of us can go to court and seek equitable relief, including by filing a motion to compel the other party to honor the arbitration agreement.  However, you and we agree that the only courts where we will seek equitable relief—or file any legal proceeding outside of arbitration—are the state and federal courts in Los Angeles, California. This exception for equitable relief does **not** waive our agreement to arbitrate.

### What if I live outside of the United States?

The Site is hosted and operated entirely in the United States and is subject to United States law. _Please do not provide us with any information or attempt to purchase our products if you live outside of the United States._ If you are from a jurisdiction outside of the United States, please notify us so that we may take necessary action. This may include terminating your account and deleting your information. We are committed to resolving those issues, so if you have any questions about how we collect or use your information you may email us at [info@easybreathe.com](mailto:info@easybreathe.com).
