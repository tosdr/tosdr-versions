[Back to Top](https://www.easybreathe.com/Privacy-Policy-2.html#top)

What information is disclosed to third parties?

We generally disclose information to provide and improve the Site and comply with legal and contractual obligations, including to fulfill your orders. Specifically, we disclose information to:

§  Service providers and contractors to provide and improve the Site, such as to help fulfill orders and process payments, store data, and provide customer service. These third parties agree to only use your information for contracted business purposes, rather than for their own data sales or marketin.

§  Related parties, including business partners or if there is a merger, acquisition, or sale, including to consider a potential contract and provide and improve the Site.

§  Legal parties and law enforcement to comply with legal obligations, such as to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or government or law enforcement requests.

In addition, cookie, device, and related data may be shared with advertising partners and affiliates, as outlined above, to provide analytics and tailor marketing content to be relevant to you. For example, we may use custom audience functions, which shares “hashed” data with digital advertising platforms to target our marketing to provide you with the most helpful information and a more personalized experience. Once these custom audiences are created, we may also use the custom audience to create a “lookalike audience” to target ads to new people who share similar characteristics to individuals in the existing custom audience. Your privacy settings for advertising platforms, such as social media websites, are set and can be updated by the respective platform. You can also disable cookies and similar technologies as outlined above. 

We do not “sell” your personal information for monetary consideration. However, the Site uses cookies and technologies, which may involve sharing of your device and technical information.

What if I access the Site from my mobile phone?

We collect and use information about you in the same way and for the same purposes if you access the Site from your mobile phone as we do when you use our website.

[Back to Top](https://www.easybreathe.com/Privacy-Policy-2.html#top) 

How do we secure and retain your information?

We have implemented various security measures to protect personal information and to treat your data securely, including by using secure managed servers to store information. Further, some of the items we sell are only available with a valid prescription. As such, we respect [HIPAA](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html) where applicable. We may utilize the following vendors for different parts of the Site:

§  ZeroLag: Zerolag services are located in a dedicated HIPAA environment. You can read more about ZeroLag’s security protocols by visiting [their security page](http://www.zerolag.com/data-security-overview).

§  Typeform: Typeform data is hosted on Amazon’s AWS service. You can read more about Typeform’s security protols [here](https://www.typeform.com/help/what-happens-to-my-data/).

§  Salesforce: Salesforce provides Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software. You can read more about Salesforce’s security protocols [here](https://www.salesforce.com/hub/technology/cloud-security-is-salesforce-priority).

§  Zapier: Zapier can help move the information from Typeform to a Salesforce CRM. You can read more about Zapier’s security protocols [here](https://zapier.com/help/data-privacy/).

However, whenever you give out personal information online there are risks, including that third parties may intercept and use that information. While we strive to protect your personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of your information. By using this Site, you expressly acknowledge and agree that we cannot guarantee the security of any data provided to or received by us through this Site and that any personal information or data is provided at your own risk. To the extent allowable, we are not liable for any damages arising out of, or in any way connected with, a third party’s unauthorized access to your information. In other words, 100% security is not always possible. Whenever you give out personal information, including online, there is a risk that a third party may intercept and use that information. Data security also depends on you. For example, you should always keep your password and account information confidential and immediately alert us of any suspected breach relating to the Site.

We retain personal information for the length of time necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice, unless a different retention period is requested by you or required by applicable laws. For example, we will retain your personal information for as long as it is needed to provide the Site features to you or fulfill a legal or contractual obligation. We may also aggregate, de-identify, or anonymize data as applicable for use in analytics, such as to track trends over time without identifying you. For requests to delete data, see below.  We use the following criteria to determine how long we retain personal information: (a) our relationship with you, such as if there is a pending transaction or active account, (b) legal obligations to retain personal information for certain purposes, such as to maintain transaction records, including under HIPAA and state laws, and (c) other obligations or considerations relating to the retention of data, such as litigation holds, investigations, or statutes of limitation. 

[Back to Top](https://www.easybreathe.com/Privacy-Policy-2.html#top) 

What age do I have to be to use this Site?

This Site is not intended for use by people under 13 years of age. We will not knowingly collect information from minors, and if we become aware of such data, we will delete it. We do not have knowledge of “selling or sharing” the personal information of consumers under the age of 16.

You may only order products if you are 18 years old or older. If you place an order, you warrant that you are 18 years old or older. If you are under the age of 18 and would like to purchase a product, your parent or guardian should place the order for you.

[Back to Top](https://www.easybreathe.com/Privacy-Policy-2.html#top) 

What are my privacy rights?

Different laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), govern your privacy rights and may depend on where you reside. To assert your rights, you may contact us as outlined below through your account, or with your full name and email address or phone number  used in connection with the Site, for verification. If an authorized agent is making a request on your behalf, the agent should provide its name and contact information, such as an email address, in addition to your information. If you are requesting to access or change sensitive data, we may require additional verification. There may be situations where we cannot grant your request, for example, if you make a request and we cannot verify your identity, or if you request deletion of data that we have a legal obligation to keep. Where we deny your request, we will take steps to inform you of the denial and provide an explanation for our actions and reasons for the denial.

Generally, we adhere to the following set of privacy rights to the extent applicable and subject to any limitations authorized by law.

§  The right to amend or correct your personal information;

§  The right to limit the processing of certain data;

§  The right to delete your personal information subject to legal limitations;

§  The right to opt-out of the sale of your information and certain data practices. 

§  California residents also have the right under the “Shine the Light” law to request information about the sharing of information for direct marketing purposes; and

§  The right to not be discriminated against for exercising privacy rights. 

For California residents, you can find a list of your rights, along with the categories of personal information we collect and use, the sources of personal information, our business and commercial purposes, and third parties to whom information is disclosed, as well as information about our retention of data, above. Please contact us with any privacy requests or questions.

To exercise your right to access, you may submit a verifiable consumer request by calling us toll free at (866)-564-2252, or by sending an email to privacy@easybreathe.com. Please include “Request for Access” in the subject line. You can also write to us at: 11859 Wilshire Blvd. Suite 110, Los Angeles, CA 90025. We strive to respond to you promptly within any legal time limits; and disclosures of information generally cover the 12-month period preceding your request, subject to applicable laws.
