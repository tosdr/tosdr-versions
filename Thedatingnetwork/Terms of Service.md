1\. TDNAP Participation, Application and Account Creation

You must accurately complete the application to become an affiliate and not use any aliases or other means to mask your true identity or contact information. You agree to update such information as and when required or requested, and you agree that your account is for your sole use and you shall not allow any other person or party to use your account, nor shall you make use of any other person or party\`s account, nor shall you sell or transfer your account.  You agree to have full capacity and authority to enter into this binding Agreement on behalf of yourself or any legal entity on which you claim to act on behalf of.

We reserve the right to reject your application for any reason, including but not limited to the reason that we believe your traffic sources or promotional methods are unsuitable for our Affiliate Program, or if we suspect you may breach this Agreement.

The Links will serve to identify you as an affiliate from our Affiliate Program and will establish a link from your Media to the Program Web Site.

2\. Payments and Commissions
----------------------------

2.1 TDNAP will pay Affiliate for each Qualified Action (the "Commission"). A "Qualified Action" means an individual person who (a) accesses the Program Web Site via the Link, where the Link is the last link to the Program Web Site, (b) is not a computer generated user, such as a robot, spider, computer script or other automated, artificial or fraudulent method to appear like an individual, real live person, (c) is not using pre-populated fields (d) completes all of the information required for such action within the time period allowed by TDNAP and (e) is not later determined by TDNAP to be fraudulent, incomplete, unqualified or a duplicate (f) does not later request a refund or initiate a chargeback or reverse a payment. In addition, we may reject an action which is not a lead or sale from the country of origin. We reserve the right to reject any action, which is not a Qualified Action under this Agreement as amended from time to time. We reserve the right to switch your account from a Pay Per Lead program to a Pay Per Sale program. For all Affiliate Programs where the payable action is a sale (Pay Per Sale “PPS” and/or Pay Per Trial “PPT”) we reserve the right to do the following: if an Affiliate is paid for a given Action but the respective sale is refunded afterwards we can deduct the commission amount paid for this Action from any future commission due to the Affiliate.

2.2 Commission payments are made in US currency and paid weekly or monthly upon request. Weekly is defined from Sunday to Saturday and monthly is defined as a calendar month. Check payments have a $100 minimum (no fees), Bank Wire payments have a $1020 minimum ($20 bank wire fee) and 3rd party e-payments (Paxum) have a $500 minimum (no fees). Should a payment need to be reissued for any reason, there will be a stop payment and reissuing processing fee of $20 (or €15) deducted from the payment, plus the fee cost of the next payment. Payments will be held until the minimum is reached or a written email request is made to be paid out, which then will be paid out on the following payment cycle. Accounts with a balance of less than the minimum balance will roll over to the next payment cycle, and will continue to roll over until the minimum balance is reached. We reserve the right to charge back to your account any previously paid Qualified Actions that are later determined to have not met the requirements to be a Qualified Action. Affiliates are independent contractors and the relationship between the Company and the Affiliate is not one of employment relationship. The Affiliate is solely responsible for any taxes or social security costs due as a result of any payments received from the Company. You understand and agree that, if at any time we believe your account has been compromised, or this Agreement has been, or may have been breached, we reserve the right to withhold making any payment to you until such time as we have concluded our investigation and you agree to fully co-operate with any investigation at your own cost including providing all required identification documents and other documents if so requested. Your failure to promptly comply with any notification will result in your payments being delayed. We may withhold your final payment for a reasonable period of time to make sure that the total commission is calculated accurately and the correct amount is paid.

2.3 All Commissions will be paid in USD, should you require to receive funds in Euros and we agree to it, such currency will be converted based upon our banks conversion on the date of payment and Bank Wire payments will have a €1015 minimum (€15 bank wire fee).

2.4 We shall automatically generate an invoice on your behalf for all Commissions payable under this Agreement and shall remit payment to you based upon that invoice. All tracking of Links and determinations of Qualified Actions and Commissions shall be made by us in our sole discretion. In the event that you wish to dispute in good faith any portion of an invoice, you must submit that dispute to us in writing and in sufficient detail within seven (7) days of the date on the invoice. If Affiliate does not dispute the invoice as set forth herein, then Affiliate agrees that it irrevocably waives any claims based upon that invoice. All payments are made only on the basis of statistics in our tracking system. Any disputes on statistics will be considered by our team of affiliate managers and/or management.

2.5 Referral Commissions are accrued on each payment transaction for each referred billable account at the percentage offered at the time of application, typically five (5) percent.  New accounts are considered referred by you if they sign up through your referral link or mentioned during an application submitted. Payments from Referral Commission will be added to the regular Commissions and processed in one invoice and payment.
