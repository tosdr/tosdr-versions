### 1\. Terms

In the event of any discrepancy between the versions, the English version shall prevail in determining the spirit, intent, and meaning of these terms of services.

### 2\. Use License

Cytoid also provides users with a means of hosting user created content (**"User Submissions"**) allowing other users to gain access to uploaded content.

Cytoid makes no guarantees as to whether any user-uploaded content and information is accurate, current, or of substantial quality. We assume no responsibility as to whether objectionable content has been uploaded. We assume no responsibility over whether users have the rights to distribute User Submissions.

Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials, including User Submissions, on Cytoid for personal, non-commercial usage only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not:

1. modify or copy the materials;

3. attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any part of Cytoid;
4. remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; or
