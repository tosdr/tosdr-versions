The Company also reserves the right to take punitive action against the seller/buyer of that account.**

**The Company reserves the right to cancel contractual ties with a user and to block their account if they use Internet bots. A bot is defined as a computer program that automatically performs recurrent actions. Bots perform monotonous recurrent actions, thereby the rate of performance of such actions is much higher than the rate attainable by human beings. The Company has the right to seize any profit gained as a result of multiple registrations, fraudulent actions or improper use as provided for by these General Terms of Service. All revenues unlawfully received in the Company’s system will be confiscated. Users understand and agree that The Company determines the amount of damages it will request as compensation.

We Share Abundance maintains full custody of all funds and associated user information and data, which we have permission to turn over to the relevant authorities in the event of your account being suspended or closed due to fraud investigation or your violation of any Terms and Conditions. If you are found to be in violation of any of the above rules or trying to gain an unfair advantage to abuse the service, your account will be suspended and your account balance forfeited.**

15. **ACCOUNT SUSPENSION AND LIMITIATION OF USE**

**If suspicion of any fraudulent actions exists, The Company reserves the right to block accounts at its discretion for as much time as it is needed to perform an investigation. Anonymizers or proxy systems must not be used to access The Company’s systems or platforms. If an anonymizer or a proxy server is used to enter the system, The Company reserves the right to block such user’s account at its own discretion. The account of a user who violates these rules will be blocked. The Company also reserves the right to suspend, block or delete the account of any member who behaves in an antagonistic way to any other member, or brings The Company into disrepute through comments or activities. If an account is closed due to violation of the terms of the contract, all amounts in the account will be confiscated.**

**The Company reserves the right to block or limit accounts, credit balances on accounts or access to or use of certain functions, with or without prior notice, temporarily or indefinitely. If, for example, a user behaves excessively and non-constructively or destructively slandering The Company or in relation to The Company or its products towards third parties and takes a view that has not been proven with facts, that is no longer seen as freedom of expression, but as reputational damage, The Company reserves the right to perform the steps specified above.**

**Creating or operating so-called multi-accounts, or keeping accounts under the same IP, previously not explicitly reported to The Company and where commissions may have been incurred or even disbursed, is prohibited and may be considered grounds for account suspension and/or limitation of the user.   Users should notify unintentional multi-accounts, such as family members, in a timely manner to the support.**

**Advertising or recommending We Share Abundance as an investment or promise of profits may lead to account suspension and/or limitation of use.**

**Failure to respond to a KYC request from The Company in a timely fashion may result in account suspension and/or limitation of use.**

**Exploiting vulnerabilities, bugs, errors, security vulnerabilities, or methods that are the result of fraud in any form in The Company’s platform to their advantage or to the disadvantage of others, this may lead to the user’s account suspension and or limitation of use.**

**In addition to the exploitation of unknown or already known security vulnerabilities, this also includes cheating of members, users, employees or generally third parties.**

16. **CANCELLATION OF ACCOUNT**

**At any time, a member can request cancellation of their account and receive a refund of any balance not exceeding the US$ value of deposits made less the US$ value of withdrawals paid.  
Such withdrawals will be calculated as the exact value of Tokens deposited at the market value at the time of the deposit. In addition, any unmatured nest egg purchases will be refunded at the value of the purchase made and not the value of the tokens purchased. The coinpayments site is used for the market value calculation as it offers the best average market value comparing trading across all platforms and currencies in a 24-hour period. Refund calculations once accepted are paid in WESA Tokens at the Market Value at the time of payment but subject to a minimum value per WESA Token set at $2.56 until Market Value exceeds that price.  Once parity with WESAbundance Token value is reached the WESA Token will be tethered to WESAbundance.** 

**Understand that if you cancel it is not reversible and you are not allowed to re-join for at least 6 months.  Any attempt to use cancellation to change sponsor or get paid cash back or any other offers will be treated as gross misconduct and result in a lifetime ban from participation.** 

**Any request for a refund of stake is automatically also a request for the cancellation of the account.**
