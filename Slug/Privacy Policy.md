We understand that your privacy is very important to you. That's why we've developed this policy to ensure that your privacy is protected while using our sites.

About IDW.community and Information We Collect

We're an online network which provides you useful tools and communities to post and respond to questions. IDW.community is FREE.  
  
In our online anonymous registration form, we may ask you to provide us with certain information such as your email address and an initial question. None of your personally identifiable information can be accessed or used by the public to identify a specific individual. While using the website, we save your posts and comments as well as some of the pages that you view.  
  
That being said, some users may elect to connect their account on IDW.community to third-party sites such as Facebook or Google. In these cases, a user's profile name, email and sometimes main photo is collected but not shown.

Our Use of Your Information

We internally use personally identifiable information of our users to improve our marketing efforts, to statistically analyze site usage, to improve our content and product offerings as well as to customize our site's content and layout. We believe these uses allow us to improve our site and better tailor your online experience to meet your needs.  
  
We also send periodic informational updates to our members via email.  
  
We use personally identifiable information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our User Agreement.  

Our Disclosure of Your Information

We DO NOT sell, rent, or give any personally identifiable information about you to any third party without your permission.  
  
In order to maintain a healthy community, IDW.community cooperates with all law enforcement inquiries and with all third parties to enforce their intellectual property or other rights.

Your use of Other Users' Information

Security

IDW.community has security measures in place to protect and prevent the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. IDW.community uses industry standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal identifiable information such as firewalls. However, please not that "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet. For extra layers of protection of your identity online, in general, we suggest not using personally identifiable email addresses and not using the same passwords across multiple web sites.
