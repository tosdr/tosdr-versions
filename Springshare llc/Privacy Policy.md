### Our Use of Cookies and Similar Technologies

### How We Use Information About You

We may use information about you for a variety of purposes, as described below:

* To perform and deliver Springshare Services. We use information you provide us or your institution (our Customer) provides to us to deliver Services, fulfill the terms of any agreement with our Customers, or to complete a transaction you initiate with us. To be clear, we do not access or use _Customer Data_ (as defined below) processed through the Springshare Services except for the purposes set forth in our agreement with the Customers.

* To support and improve our existing Services or create new Services.
* For any of the "Legal Purposes" described below in the section entitled _How We Share Information with Third Parties_.

### How We Share Your Information With Third Parties

We may share your information with third parties for a variety of purposes, as described below.

* Affiliates. We may share your information with our corporate affiliates for any of the purposes described in this Policy.
* Third-party service providers. We use third-party service providers to help us deliver and perform Springshare Services.

* Business partners. We may share your information with our business partners to fulfill your requests for services, complete a transaction that you initiate, or meet the terms of any agreement that you have with us or our business partners.
* Third-party plugins. Springshare Services may integrate certain third-party plug-ins. Even if you do not click on these plug-ins, they may collect information about you, such as your IP address and the pages that you view. They also may set and/or access a cookie. These plugins are governed by the privacy policy of the third-party providing them.
* Legal Purposes. We may disclose your information to cooperate with law enforcement, government or regulatory bodies, content protection organizations, or judicial processes as required by the applicable laws and regulations. We may also use or disclose information to enforce or protect the rights or safety of Springshare Services users, us, or others. We will provide notice to individuals prior to such disclosures, to the extent it is practicable to do so and allowed by law.
* To facilitate the financing, securitization, insuring, merger, acquisition, sale, assignment, bankruptcy, or other disposal of all or part of our business or assets.

When we transfer your information to third party companies, we will ensure they maintain the same level of security as us.

Keep in mind that any information you disclose publicly – either in a public profile or through message boards or other public areas – may be collected and used by others, may be indexable by search engines, and might not be able to be erased from public view to the extent they have been copied to external sites. Please be careful when disclosing personal information in these public areas.

### Security

Springshare takes the security of your information and the security of Springshare Services very seriously. We take commercially reasonable measures to protect against unauthorized access to, or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of, data that you share and that we collect and store. These security measures may include practices such as keeping your data on a secured server behind a firewall, internal reviews of our data collection practices and platforms, and industry-standard encryption technologies. However, no website or service is completely secure and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.

If you have reason to believe that a third-party has gained unauthorized access to your information, please contact us immediately at privacy@springshare.com. If Springshare becomes aware of any data breach, we will notify affected individuals or, with respect to Springshare Services, affected institutions as soon as reasonably possible.

### Your Rights and Choices

#### Communication Preferences and Opt-outs

If you have subscribed to one or more of our email newsletters or are receiving marketing emails from us and you don’t want them anymore, you can unsubscribe. Follow the instructions contained in the email message to opt-out of receiving future messages of that type. However, you cannot unsubscribe from some service related messages ("operational emails") so long as you maintain an account with Springshare Services.

#### Access, Correction, and Erasure, Right to limit use, and to limit disclosure

You may request to review, correct or delete the personal information that you have previously provided to us through the Springshare Services. For requests to access, correct or delete your personal information, please send your request along with any details you may have regarding the method by which the information was submitted to privacy@springshare.com. Requests to access, change, or delete your information will be addressed within a reasonable timeframe.

To help protect your privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity, such as requiring a username or userID, or password, or other types of verification before granting access to or removing your information. In cases where we are acting as a processor of personal data for our Customer, we may first refer your request to the Customer that submitted your personal data. We will assist our Customer as needed in responding to your request, as further described below under _Springshare Services-Customer Data_.

In accordance with the Data Privacy Framework, EEA, UK and Swiss residents whose personal information is collected may have a right to access personal information regarding them, and to limit use and disclosure of their personal information or to object to their personal data being used for any purpose materially different from the purposes disclosed to them or stated within this Privacy Policy. Springshare will provide the said data to EEA, UK and Swiss residents upon request and will comply with any requests to limit use of their personal information.

Please contact privacy@springshare.com for more information about exercising these rights.

#### Data Retention and Deletion

If you request to delete your personal information, we will endeavor to fulfill your request but some personal information may persist in backup copies for a certain period of time and may be retained as necessary for legitimate business purposes or to comply with our legal obligations. Springshare's policy is to keep backups of Springshare Services data for 35 days, after which the original customer data older than 35 days is permanently deleted from Springshare servers. Springshare may retain your information for a period of time consistent with the original purpose of collection, and for a reasonable time thereafter in accordance with applicable law. We also may retain your information during the period of time needed for Springshare to conduct audits, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.

#### Cross-border transfers of personal information

Springshare Services are hosted in data centers located in several regions around the world. Every region operates independently of one another, and we use all reasonable efforts to host the Springshare Services and Customer Data in their respective home regions. Springshare Services are currently hosted in four (4) regions - United States, Canada, Australia, and European Union. If, during the course of conducting normal business of providing Springshare Services, we transfer your information to a recipient in a country outside your respective home region, we will ensure that at least one of the following applies: (i) the transfer will be to countries deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by your respective governing body (such as European Commission); (ii) we have used specific model contracts (for example, those approved by the European Commission) intended to give personal data the same protection it has in its home region; (iii) where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer information to them if they are part of the Data Privacy Framework which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US; or (iv) any alternative transfer mechanism that lawfully supports the transfer under the GDPR or similar law in your home region.

### Children

The Springshare Services and websites are intended for use by users aged 13 and older. We do not market to nor intentionally collect any personally identifiable information from children under thirteen (13) years of age. If you are under 13, please do not register for any of our Services or websites or provide us with any personally identifying information (such as your name, email address or phone number).
