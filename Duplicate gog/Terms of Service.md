GOG User Agreement
==================

Hello, GOG user! We hope you have a great time playing games and doing other cool things via GOG.COM and the GOG GALAXY application. We've put a lot of work into building GOG.COM and GOG GALAXY and as a result we need to have some rules about how you can access and use GOG services. So, we've put this Agreement together as simply as we legally can, with some short summaries to help you understand what it means. However, please be aware that the full text wording is what is important/binding legally. Please read these terms carefully before you start using the GOG services - by using GOG services, you agree to be bound by this Agreement and any terms incorporated in it.

Please also be aware that by accepting the Agreement, you also accept other GOG rules that apply to GOG services, including:

* Our [Privacy Policy](https://support.gog.com/hc/articles/212632109) which explains what data we collect from you and how we protect it;
* [GOG Code of Conduct](https://support.gog.com/hc/articles/16033977811613) which is a set of rules you need to follow as part of our community, explaining what is (not) allowed on GOG and how we moderate content posted here;
* [Infringing Content and Copyright Policy](https://support.gog.com/hc/articles/16033687971613) which explains how you can report unlawful content on GOG and what happens when you do.

| LEGALLY BINDING VERSION | "ENGLISH" VERSION |
| 1\. ABOUT THIS AGREEMENT<br>------------------------<br><br>  <br><br>1.1 This Agreement is a contract between you (we will further call you just “you”) and GOG sp. z o.o., Jagiellońska 74, 03-301 Warsaw, Poland (we will further call ourselves “GOG” or just “us”) and applies to www.GOG.COM, your GOG user account, GOG GALAXY application (including GOG GALAXY store), any games or videos or other content or services which you purchase or access via us, the GOG web forums, GOG customer and technical support and other services we provide to you (we'll just call all this “GOG services” for short). Here we set out your rights and obligations as a recipient of GOG services.<br><br>  <br><br>1.2. Additional terms may apply to GOG services and in such a case we will post them for your acceptance. For example, if you would like to use the GOG GALAXY application, the relevant terms will be posted for your acceptance before you start using these services.<br><br>  <br><br>1.3 Also, when we're talking about games, in-game content, virtual items or currency or GOG videos or other content or services which you can purchase or access via GOG services, we’ll just call them “GOG games” or “GOG videos” respectively and when we talk about them all together they are “GOG content”. <br><br>  <br><br>1.4 We didn’t want to make this document too long, but keep in mind that by accepting our User Agreement you also accept:<br><br>* our [Privacy Policy](https://support.gog.com/hc/articles/212632109) - which explains what data we collect from you and how we protect it, <br>* [GOG Code of Conduct](https://support.gog.com/hc/articles/16033977811613) which is a set of rules you need to follow as part of our community,<br>* [Infringing Content and Copyright Policy](https://support.gog.com/hc/articles/16033687971613) which explains how you can report unlawful content on GOG and what happens when you do. <br><br>  <br><br>1.5 GOG works with trusted partners, including our related company CD PROJEKT S.A., developers and publishers, payment providers, customer service software providers and others (“Partners”) – more on them later in this Agreement.<br><br>  <br><br>1.6 If you're over 18, then welcome! If you're between 16 and 18, before we extend an equally warm welcome, please ask your parent or guardian to review and approve this Agreement on your behalf (because in some countries people under a certain age cannot legally enter into contracts like this Agreement). If you’re not 16 yet you cannot have a GOG account or use the GOG services because legally we cannot handle personal data of children without a special parental or guardian’s permission (but your parents/guardians are welcome to sign up themselves). | This agreement explains how you can access and use GOG services, like GOG.COM, GOG GALAXY application or GOG games and video content. |
| Please make sure you also read our [Privacy Policy](https://support.gog.com/hc/articles/212632109), [GOG Code of Conduct](https://support.gog.com/hc/articles/16033977811613) and our [Infringing Content and Copyright Policy](https://support.gog.com/hc/articles/16033687971613). They include important rules that apply to you when you’re using GOG services. |
| If you are not yet 18 years old (but over 16) you need parental/guardian approval to use GOG services. We know it sounds kind of silly but it is not our invention, and actually a legal requirement. |
| 2\. USING GOG SERVICES AND GOG CONTENT<br>--------------------------------------<br><br>  <br><br>2.1 We give you and other GOG users the personal right (known legally as a 'license') to use GOG services and to download, access and/or stream (depending on the content) and use GOG content. This license is for your personal use. We can stop or suspend this license in some situations, which are explained later on.<br><br>  <br><br>2.2 When you buy, access or install GOG games, you might have to agree to additional contract terms with the developer/publisher of the game (e.g. they might ask you to agree to a game specific End User License Agreement). If there is any inconsistency or dispute between those ‘EULAs’ and this Agreement, then this Agreement wins.<br><br>  <br><br>2.3 With GOG videos, you can also stream purchased video content or download it to watch the way you want.<br><br>  <br><br>2.4 Using certain third-party scripts is recommended for your full use of GOG functionality and, although that usage is optional, we cannot promise full service performance without them.<br><br>  <br><br>2.5 A quick word about GOG GALAXY, which is our (optional) application which not only allows you to buy and access GOG content but also provides cool features like unified game library, and one friends list across platforms, online multiplayer, achievements, cross-platform chat, game-time tracking, cloud-saves and game overlay. You can learn more about it [here](https://www.gog.com/galaxy).<br><br>  <br><br>2.6 In some parts of GOG services, we use recommendation systems to present you the content that you are most likely to be interested in. You can learn where we use them and how they work [here](https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/16034228157213), including what main parameters we use and how to influence them. | You have the personal right to use GOG content and services. This right can be suspended or stopped by us in some situations.<br><br>  <br><br>  <br>GOG games might have extra EULAs (End User Licensing Agreement) for you to accept.<br><br>  <br><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>As for the video content, stream or download it and watch the way you want.<br><br>You can (optionally) use certain third-party scripts to improve website performance – don’t worry, we don’t mean anything fiendish here! Just regular website scripts.  <br>  <br>You can use GOG GALAXY, which is optional and contains cool features like bringing all your games and friends in one place, online multiplayer and much more! |
| 3\. GOG ACCOUNT<br>---------------<br><br>  <br><br>3.1 To buy GOG content from GOG services, and in some cases to play/use GOG content where our partners require use of a GOG account, you will need to set up a GOG account. This will involve creating a password (which is encrypted so we can’t access it) and a username, plus giving us (for identification purposes) your email address. Please make sure your login credentials are kept secure and your account is used properly. In your GOG account settings you can also optionally set your country of residence, birthday and avatar. Our Privacy Policy gives more details about the information we collect from you and how we use it and protect it. It's [here](https://support.gog.com/hc/articles/212632109).<br><br>  <br><br>3.2 You can use your GOG account to set up a public profile accessible by other people. You can also use your GOG account to connect with other GOG users. Please act sensibly and remember you are responsible for your own actions.<br><br>  <br><br>3.3 Your GOG account and GOG content are personal to you and cannot be shared with, sold, gifted or transferred to anyone else. Your access to and use of them is subject to GOG’s [Privacy Policy](https://support.gog.com/hc/articles/212632109) and [Code of Conduct](https://support.gog.com/hc/articles/16033977811613) which are updated or amended when necessary.<br><br>  <br><br>3.4. Access to and use of the games purchased from different platforms (i.e. with what we call ‘Keyless Access’), including their minimum system requirements is governed by respective third-party platform policies and (as applicable) additional contract terms with the developer/publisher of the game (e.g. they might ask you to agree to a game specific End User License Agreement). It may require having a third-party platform account. These platforms may roll out patches or updates for your purchased games. | To buy GOG content you will need to set up a GOG account. Make sure to keep your password safe! Check out our Privacy Policy and Code of Conduct too (link opposite).  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>Your GOG account will have a public profile and you can communicate with other GOG users. Be sensible and careful!<br><br>  <br><br>  <br>Your GOG account and content are for you only – there are rules about how to use them (see opposite).  <br>  <br>  <br>If you purchase games with Keyless Access to a partner gaming platform you may be required to have a third-party platform account. Other requirements may apply (see opposite). |
| 4\. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS<br>-----------------------<br><br>  <br><br>4.1 Because GOG gives you access to many different services and games created at different times and via different platforms, we cannot give you one set of system requirements for all GOG services or GOG content. Please make sure your computer and Internet connection are good enough to use GOG services and play GOG games and videos.<br><br>  <br><br>4.2 What we can tell you is that using any GOG game will require a computer, equipped with a mouse and keyboard (touchscreen controls are not supported), with an appropriate operating system (please refer to the relevant GOG product page) with all service packs and important updates installed on it. All GOG games should be natively installed on a computer that meets or exceeds the minimum hardware and software specifications shown on the GOG product page. GOG games are not tested on virtual machine software and therefore we do not support playing through them.<br><br>  <br><br>4.3 For GOG videos, please make sure your video player supports the videos’ format specified in the GOG product page.<br><br>  <br><br>4.4 If you have questions about system requirements, please contact us [here](https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?category=info&product=gog). Just so we're clear, you are responsible for making sure you have sufficient Internet access to download purchased GOG games or GOG videos from us or to stream GOG videos and that your system can play GOG games and watch GOG videos. | Using GOG services requires a computer with Internet access. You can find system requirements for specific games available on GOG on their GOG product pages. |
| 5\. BETAS<br>---------<br><br>  <br><br>5.1 As GOG develops, we may offer you optional access to 'beta' versions of GOG software or services (e.g. new versions of the GOG GALAXY application made available prior to its general release) or GOG content.<br><br>  <br><br>Here are the rules:<br><br>  <br><br>a) We (or any applicable publisher/partner) will set the conditions and requirements for your beta access. Providing and maintaining a beta, and who can use a beta, is at our discretion.<br><br>  <br><br>b) You may be required to go through a registration process or other requirements to access the beta (and this may include you meeting eligibility criteria).<br><br>  <br><br>c) Betas will be time-limited and there may be extra contract requirements.<br><br>  <br><br>d) The beta may involve temporary or permanent server/progress/content wipes, resets or amendments.<br><br>  <br><br>e) The beta may be subject to confidentiality restrictions (which will be notified to you in advance if so).<br><br>  <br><br>f) You may be invited to participate in a feedback process regarding the beta – this is totally optional but would be really valued.<br><br>  <br><br>g) The beta is for your personal use and enjoyment, so you must not sell, loan or otherwise transfer it to anyone else.<br><br>  <br><br>h) The point of you getting beta access is to allow you to try something new, but we would expect you to recognise that it will not be complete yet. Therefore betas will be provided 'as is' without any additional promises from us or any liability on us if it is not complete or does not work fully or causes issues. Betas may not be totally feature-complete and there may be feature changes, modifications or removals during the beta. | We may provide access to GOG content in beta/pre-release form. For example, a publisher/partner may decide to release a game or a part of it in beta, or any other pre-release (early access) program. Any such GOG content will also be governed by these rules unless the relevant publisher specifies its own rules (which will prevail over these rules).  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>We may offer beta access to new releases of GOG software or services. Beta versions aren't complete and we're not responsible for what happens while you're using them. Fear not, they should not blow up your computer! |
| 6\. PAYING FOR GOG CONTENT AND GETTING REFUNDS<br>----------------------------------------------<br><br>### Paying for GOG content<br><br>6.1 After you decide that you like a GOG game, GOG video or other GOG content, you usually will need to pay for it before you can access it (though we do have some free content too!). You can pay in different ways: (i) using a valid debit or credit card; or (ii) using PayPal or any other authorized payment provider. Remember to keep your payment details secure.<br><br>  <br><br>6.2 When you use a payment method to buy GOG content, we're relying on your promise that you're able to use that method. You are responsible for any purchases made using your GOG account or payment method and you agree to the pricing, payment and billing policies applicable to them, as notified to you at the time of purchase. All payments are non-refundable and non-transferable except as expressly provided in this Agreement. <br><br>  <br><br>6.3 You can always pay for GOG content in US Dollars. However if you happen to live in countries where your local currency is supported (see our Support section [here](https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001947034?product=gog) for details), you will be able to pay in your local currency. You might have to pay a currency conversion charge if you are not paying in your home currency and some banks might also add other kinds of transaction fees.<br><br>  <br><br>6.4. All prices are visible in the product catalog page. They’re inclusive of taxes like VAT, if applicable. You should also expect some sales taxes/VAT to be added to your price at checkout, if required by your local laws (f.ex. in US or Canada).<br><br>  <br><br>### GOG Wallet<br><br>6.5 GOG offers users a digital account balance called the “GOG Wallet” in connection with your user account, which you can use to make purchases of GOG content on dedicated GOG services. Funds can be added to it in two ways: (i) using your chosen payment method; or (ii) by us as part of our ‘Voluntary Refund Policy’ (see link [here](https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006129837?product=galaxy)) in which case we may offer refunds to GOG Wallet that you can use to get a replacement GOG game or other GOG content. The GOG Wallet is made available subject to rules which are set out on our GOG Wallet page [here](https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001941953-FAQ-GOG-Wallet?product=galaxy).<br><br>### GOG Bonus Codes<br><br>6.6. We may also issue usually time-limited bonus codes which give you free or reduced price access to GOG content (we’ll call them “Bonus Codes”). If you receive Bonus Codes when you buy GOG content but later decide to return that GOG content, then we think it’s fair for you to return the Bonus Codes too. Therefore, we will terminate it or, if it has been redeemed for a GOG game, that game will be removed from your account.<br><br>### Direct to Account Distribution<br><br>6.7 We have a direct to account distribution feature (we’ll call it ‘GOG Direct to Account) where distribution platforms who partner with us would be able to sell games or other content to you, where you could choose for that game/content to be automatically activated within your GOG account, without the need to redeem any codes. Just to be clear, the whole purchase process is handled by the other platform, so in case of any issues with the purchase process please speak with them directly. For this particular matter therefore, we cannot offer you Our Voluntary Refund Policy (because GOG didn’t sell the game/content). Of course, anything connected to our platform’s services is still our responsibility. | You can use a debit/credit card, PayPal or different local payment methods, to make purchases. Keep your payment details secure.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>You are responsible for your purchases.   <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>You can pay in US Dollars and, depending on where you live, in your local currency (see opposite).  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>We offer you a ‘GOG Wallet’ which you can use to make purchases. In some cases we can add funds to your GOG Wallet in connection with our Voluntary Refund Policy (see opposite sections).  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>If you decide to return or exchange GOG content which came with Bonus Codes, we think it’s fair to ask you to give them back too.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>Thanks to our GOG Direct to Account feature, we can activate a game/content that you purchase from applicable distribution platforms directly on your GOG account – cool! |
| 7\. REFUNDS AND RETURNS<br>-----------------------<br><br>### Statutory refund rights<br><br>7.1. If you are a resident of the European Union or other applicable jurisdictions (excluding the USA), then you have the statutory right to withdraw from a purchase of GOG content within 14 days of your purchase, without giving a reason. To exercise the right of withdrawal, you should inform us of your decision to withdraw from this contract by an unequivocal statement (an email sent to support@GOG.COM, or a physical letter at an address set out in Section 23 below). You may use the model withdrawal form attached at the end of this Agreement, but you do not have to. To meet the withdrawal deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your communication concerning your exercise of the right of withdrawal before the withdrawal period has expired. However, this does not apply where you have expressly consented to the performance of the GOG content (which is digital content) beginning immediately upon conclusion of the purchase process and have acknowledged the loss of your withdrawal rights.<br><br>  <br><br>7.2. Neither this nor any other part of this User Agreement affects your statutory rights. In particular:<br><br>  <br><br>a) For Australian Users: Our goods come with guarantees that cannot be excluded under the Australian Consumer Law. You are entitled to a replacement or refund for a major failure and compensation for any other reasonably foreseeable loss or damage. You are also entitled to have the goods repaired or replaced if the goods fail to be of acceptable quality and the failure does not amount to a major failure. Details [here](https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/360025857893?product=gog).<br><br>  <br><br>b) For New Zealand Users: Neither this nor any other part of this User Agreement excludes, restricts or modifies the application of any right or remedy that cannot be so excluded, restricted or modified including those conferred by the New Zealand Consumer Guarantees Act 1993. Under this Act are guarantees which include that goods and services are of acceptable quality. If this guarantee is not met there are entitlements to have the software remedied (which may include repair, replacement or refund). If a remedy cannot be provided or the failure is of a substantial character, the act provides for a refund.<br><br>### Our Voluntary Refund Policy<br><br>7.3. We understand that sometimes a purchase doesn't turn out how you expected and we want to be fair to GOG users. This is why on top of your statutory refund rights (described in section 7.1.-7.2. above) we may offer you a Voluntary Refund Policy described [here](https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006129837?product=galaxy). In some rare cases if we have reasonable doubts regarding your refund request we may not apply the Voluntary Refund Policy. In no case this will deprive you of any applicable statutory refund rights. A sale is considered final once your refund rights expire (unless we agree otherwise on a case by case basis). | If you are EU resident, we are obligated to inform you about a statutory withdrawal right, but still our Voluntary Refund Policy is better.<br><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>In some jurisdictions, you may have statutory rights with regards to your purchase e.g. in Australia or New Zealand (see opposite)  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>We're happy to offer you our assistance according to our Voluntary Refund Policy on top of your statutory refund rights (see details opposite). |
| 8\. VIRTUAL ITEMS AND VIRTUAL CURRENCY<br>--------------------------------------<br><br>  <br><br>8.1 With certain GOG content you may be able to purchase or acquire virtual items and/or virtual currency (we’ll call them “Virtual Goods” for short). Virtual Goods are subject to this Agreement and in particular the following default rules, unless there are specific rules for that GOG content (which will prevail over these rules).<br><br>  <br><br>8.2 Virtual Goods are digital items only with no cash-value or real world existence and cannot be ‘bought’, ‘sold’, gifted, transferred or redeemed, exchanged for other Virtual Goods, ‘real world’ money, goods, services or items of monetary value. Trading Virtual Goods is prohibited (unless you are specifically permitted to do so). Your right to use any Virtual Goods is limited to a limited, nonexclusive, non-assignable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to use them solely for your personal entertainment and non-commercial use in the applicable GOG content. You have no property interest or right or title in any Virtual Goods, which remains the appropriate publisher’s property. Virtual Goods may be changed, amended or reversed if necessary, including to enforce this Agreement. If necessary, limits may be placed on the use of Virtual Goods (including transaction limits and balance amounts).<br><br>  <br><br>8.3 The existence of a particular offer for Virtual Goods is not a commitment by us to maintain or continue to make the Virtual Goods or that offer available in the future. The scope, variety and type of Virtual Goods that you may obtain can change and we have the right to manage, modify and remove Virtual Goods if we consider necessary for the ongoing operation of GOG or GOG content or for other legitimate reasons, in which case we will have no liability to you or anyone for the exercise of such rights. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you of any such change and to explain the reason for such change. | With some GOG content you can buy virtual items/currency. Opposite are the default rules (unless specific rules apply for specific virtual items/currency). |
| 9\. PATCHES, UPDATES AND CHANGES<br>--------------------------------<br><br>  <br>9.1 Occasionally we may need to patch or update GOG services or GOG content (for example to add or remove features or to resolve software bugs). We need these rights in order to keep GOG running efficiently and safely. Not patching or updating the GOG services or GOG content may result in inferior performance of your version or incompatibility of your version with some of the GOG services or GOG content features. Doing so, you are also risking not installing important security updates. Our Partners may use GOG services to roll out patches or updates for applicable GOG content. | From time to time we may need to patch or update how GOG services or content work. If you do not patch or update GOG services or GOG content, you may end up with not every feature working properly, and you’re also risking not installing important security updates. |
| 10\. OWNERSHIP OF GOG SERVICES AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS<br>---------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>10.1 GOG services including (but not limited to) their graphics, computer code, user interface, look and feel, audio, video, text, layout, databases, data and all other content, and all legal and exploitation rights regarding them are either owned by us or we license them from third parties. GOG content is owned by its developers/publishers and licensed by us. All rights are reserved except as we have explained in this Agreement. You may not use or exploit any part of the GOG services or GOG content except as explained in this Agreement.<br><br>  <br><br>10.2. GOG respects the intellectual property rights of others. Please read more [here](https://support.gog.com/hc/articles/16033687971613). | We spent years building GOG.COM and the GOG services, it’s our little baby. It’s the same for the games/videos and their respective creators/publishers. Enjoy it all, but please behave and do not cause trouble. |
| 11\. RULES FOR USING GOG SERVICES<br>---------------------------------<br><br>11.1 Please follow these rules regarding the GOG services and GOG content, and any additional rules we link in 11.2 below. Please read these rules carefully since failure to follow them (particularly those in relation to cheating) will be considered a material breach of this Agreement, which could lead to suspension or cancellation of your access to GOG services. Here are the rules:<br><br>  <br><br>(a) Only use GOG services or GOG content for your personal enjoyment (for example, don't use them to make money, for piracy or for political purposes).<br><br>  <br><br>(b) Regarding GOG content, what you can do practically apart from playing the games (like create derivative works of it) depends on what the GOG content rights holder allows you to do (GOG can’t grant such rights). So please check this with the rights holder directly (the first thing you should do though is to check if they have a EULA and if so what it says). We also ask that you make only genuine attempts to improve the GOG content.<br><br>  <br><br>(c) Regarding GOG services (which includes GOG software), unless you have prior GOG permission please don’t modify, merge, distribute, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or create derivative works of them – unless you’re allowed in this Agreement or by the law in your country. We’d like to emphasize that you are free to contact us for permission to do these things and we will review and respond to those requests in good faith. More generally, at some point in the future we want to open client protocols to make it easier for users to work with GOG data/software without any need for reverse engineering or similar techniques.<br><br>  <br><br>(d) Don't hack, harm, grief, interrupt or misuse GOG services or GOG content, GOG users or GOG personnel or use them for any similar purpose.<br><br>  <br><br>(e) Do not create, use, make available and/or distribute cheats, exploits, automation software, robots, bots, mods, hacks, spiders, spyware, cheats, scripts, trainers, extraction tools or other software that interact with or affect GOG services or GOG content in any way (including, without limitation, any unauthorized third party programs that intercept, emulate, or redirect any communication between GOG or its partners and GOG services and/or any unauthorized third party programs that collect information about GOG services).<br><br>  <br><br>(f) Don't interfere with the GOG or third party network software or other software including via tunnelling, code injection, modifying or changing GOG software, using any other similar software together with GOG services or GOG content, through protocol emulation, or through creation or use of private servers regarding GOG services or GOG content. Do not access or attempt to access areas of GOG.COM, GOG GALAXY or GOG servers that have not been made available to the public.<br><br>  <br><br>(g) Don't do or say anything which is or may be considered racist, xenophobic, sexist, defamatory or otherwise offensive or illegal (f.ex. exploiting minors, encouraging violence, engaging in fraud). Be nice to each other please!<br><br>  <br><br>(h) Don’t share, ‘buy’, ‘sell’, transfer, gift, lend, steal, misappropriate or misuse GOG accounts. GOG keys/codes can only be gifted or transferred or used in the ways permitted by GOG. If you have any questions or problems, contact customer support.<br><br>  <br><br>(i) We ask you to follow any applicable geographic or regional, language or location-based restrictions, requirements or rules regarding GOG.<br><br>  <br><br>(j) We ask you not to do anything in connection with GOG that infringes any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, privacy, publicity, or other right of others, such as images, photographs, sound files, text files, graphics files, and any other material or information.<br><br>  <br><br>11.2 In addition to the above, below is the list of additional terms that apply to you when using GOG services. We do not want to repeat ourselves, but it is important to remember that if you fail to follow them, it will be a material breach of this Agreement, which could lead to a suspension or cancellation of your access to GOG services. Here is the list:<br><br>* GOG Code of Conduct ([link](https://support.gog.com/hc/articles/16033977811613))<br>* Infringing Content and Copyright Policy ([link](https://support.gog.com/hc/articles/16033687971613)).<br><br>  <br><br>11.3 Every time we make a moderation decision resulting in restricting your access to GOG services, whenever it is possible you should receive a statement of reasons  outlining why we have made this decision. If you do not agree with the decision we have made, you have 6 months from the day that you have been informed about the decision, to make a complaint. The details on how to make a complaint should be available in your moderation decision. The description of our complaint-handling system procedure is also available in the Infringing Content & Copyright Policy ([here](https://support.gog.com/hc/articles/16033687971613)). | GOG service and content are here for your personal enjoyment and please use them for this purpose only. For example, don't interfere with or hack GOG services. Don't do or say things which are offensive or illegal. Be nice! |
| 12\. USER GENERATED CONTENT<br>---------------------------<br><br>12.1 This section is about content (e.g. text, photos or links) which you make available either to us or to other GOG users via GOG services (for example through your profile picture or through messages to other GOG users). We'll call this "User Generated Content".<br><br>  <br><br>12.2 As far as we and you are concerned, you own any User Generated Content but we need you to give us some limited rights over it so that we can actually transmit it through GOG services. So, by posting User Generated Content you give us a nonexclusive, irrevocable license to use, modify, reproduce, create derivative works from, distribute, transmit, communicate and publicly display/perform your User Generated Content in connection with GOG services.<br><br>  <br><br>12.3 It is your responsibility to make sure that you have all necessary legal rights before you use User Generated Content and for checking they are safe to use – we can't know that ourselves, and we can't check it for you, so we have to rely on you.<br><br>  <br><br>12.4. However, we have the right (but not the obligation) to review and if appropriate or legally necessary to remove any User Generated Content which is unlawful, tortious, defamatory, obscene, invasive of the privacy of another person, threatening, harassing, abusive, hateful, racist or pornographic. If you find that any such content has been posted on GOG services, please let us know. We ask you to read our Infringing Content and Copyright Policy ([link](https://support.gog.com/hc/articles/16033687971613)), where we explain our procedure for reporting infringing content.  If you still feel your case is not fully resolved after our internal procedure, you have access to an out-of-court dispute settlement - more on this in Section 20 below. | You own your user generated content used in GOG services. Please make sure it doesn’t breach any third party rights.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>If you find that illegal or inappropriate content has been posted on GOG services, please let us know. |
| 13\. FEEDBACK OR SUGGESTIONS<br>----------------------------<br><br>13.1 You’re welcome to give us feedback and suggestions to improve GOG services and we really value them all. However, just so we’re clear, we don’t have to use or accept them and we won’t owe you anything (financially or otherwise) regarding them. | It’s cool to send us feedback and suggestions about GOG services, thank you! But please, don’t be disappointed if we don’t use them or reward you for them. |
| 14\. USING GOG CONTENT IN FAN WORK<br>----------------------------------<br><br>14.1 For fan work (e.g. works like fan mods, machinima, parodies, homages, 'Let's Play' or other videos or artwork), you need to check with the content owner (e.g. the developer or publisher) if they are OK with it and if so you should get permission from them. The reason is simple – the GOG content is the property of the respective owner, not ours. | If you want to make fan works using GOG content, you will have to find out on your own if that is permitted by the owner and get any necessary legal rights. |
| 15\. THIRD-PARTY CONTENT AND EXTERNAL SERVICES<br>----------------------------------------------<br><br>15.1 You might get links to third-party websites or content through GOG services which aren’t connected to us. Using them is up to you – we’re not responsible for them, we can't promise they will work, what they'll be like or if they're free.<br><br>  <br><br>15.2 You can also use your GOG account to get easy access to some external, GOG approved partner services, e.g. The Witcher games and sites from our sister company CD PROJEKT RED. They will have their own terms and conditions which you will need to agree and follow. Just to be clear: using these services is all optional and up to you. You have the power! | You click on a link on GOG services taking you outside of our little kingdom = we cannot look after you anymore.<br><br>  <br><br>  <br>You can also use your GOG account to access GOG approved external services, like our sister company CD PROJEKT RED’s cool stuff. It’s totally optional though. |
| 16\. WARRANTIES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY REGARDING GOG SERVICES<br>------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>16.1 We warrant that: (i) we have the right to enter this Agreement and to grant you the license to use GOG services in section 2.1; and (ii) we will take reasonable care with the GOG services and your use of them; and (iii) we will use reasonable endeavors to comply with applicable laws in performing our obligations to you under this Agreement.<br><br>  <br><br>16.2. Your representations and warranties. You represent and warrant that you have the full power and ability to enter into this Agreement and will fully follow its terms. You also represent and warrant that any User Generated Content, which you transmit via GOG services does not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of any third party. You further represent and warrant that you will not use or contribute User Generated Content that is unlawful, tortious, defamatory, obscene, invasive of the privacy of another person, threatening, harassing, abusive, hateful, racist or pornographic.<br><br>  <br><br>16.3. We work hard to try to make GOG content work on your systems but we only have limited time to carry out tests and we don't always get everything right. Therefore, we can't accept any liability or responsibility for GOG content except where required by law (see 7.1.-7.2 above). We are also not responsible for anything that happens to GOG.COM or GOG services which is outside of our control and we do not guarantee GOG services will work 100% of the time. However, don't forget you may be entitled to GOG content return and refund if it has technical issues - see section 7.3. | We make legally binding promises (called 'warranties') about GOG services, for example that we will take reasonable care regarding your use of them.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>You also make warranties about your use of GOG services, for example that you will follow fully GOG terms and not do or post anything unlawful. |
| 17\. TERMINATION<br>----------------<br><br>17.1 Your right to terminate the Agreement. You may terminate this Agreement at any time and without giving any reason by completely ceasing to use GOG services. If you would like us to delete your account please contact our Support Team [here](https://support.gog.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?category=info&product=gog) or simply by sending an email request to [privacy@gog.com](mailto:privacy@gog.com). Termination will not affect already existing rights or obligations of us or you.<br><br>  <br><br>17.2. Our right to terminate the Agreement. If you materially breach this Agreement, we reserve the right to suspend or cancel your access to GOG services and GOG content. By material breach of the Agreement we mean a serious breach which could cause significant harm to GOG, GOG users, as well as, in particular breach of the provisions of section 11 above or GOG Code of Conduct. If we suspend or cancel your access to GOG services or GOG content we'll take reasonable steps to contact you to explain why we have done this and what (if anything) you can do as a result.<br><br>  <br><br>17.3 It seems very unlikely, but if we have to stop providing access to GOG services and GOG content permanently (not because of any breach by you), we will try to give you at least sixty (60) days advance notice by posting a note on www.GOG.COM and sending an email to every registered user – during that time you should be able to download any GOG content you purchased. | You can terminate this Agreement by just stopping using GOG services for good.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>If you seriously breach this Agreement you may lose access to GOG services (temporarily or permanently).  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>In the very unlikely situation that we have to stop running GOG we'll do our best to give you advance notice, so that you can download and safely store all your DRM-free content. |
| 18\. FORCE MAJEURE<br>------------------<br><br>18.1 Neither you nor us will be liable for any failure to perform any obligation under this Agreement or to provide access to GOG services and GOG content if that failure is caused by the happening of any unforeseen event beyond your or our reasonable control including without limitation, Internet outages, communications outages, fire, flood, war or act of God. | If unforeseen events beyond your or our control occur (war, earthquake, gigantic flood, alien attack, Godzilla, etc. ok the last two are jokes), then neither of us will be liable to the other for any obligations which can't be performed. |
| 19\. GOVERNING LAW<br>------------------<br><br>### For users resident in the European Union and elsewhere in the world (but not the USA):<br><br>19.1 You and we agree that your use of GOG services and GOG content and this Agreement will be governed by and interpreted according to the laws of the Republic of Poland and that any dispute regarding this Agreement will be heard non-exclusively by the courts of the Republic of Poland. In any legal claim under this Agreement, the side which wins will be entitled to its legal fees and expenses.<br><br>  <br><br>19.2. The above choice of governing law and jurisdiction is subject to any mandatorily applicable principles of consumer protection or other law in your jurisdiction of residence which would not otherwise be available.<br><br>### For users in the USA only:<br><br>19.3 You and we agree that your use of GOG services and GOG content, and this Agreement, will be deemed to be entered into in Los Angeles, California and governed by and interpreted according to the laws of the State of California, USA (and, if applicable, US federal law). Any legal claim by you against GOG will be made exclusively in any state or federal court located in Los Angeles, California, which will have subject matter jurisdiction regarding the dispute between you and us and therefore we both consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of those courts. In any legal claim under this Agreement, the side which wins will be entitled to its legal fees and expenses. | Any legal questions/complaints/claims regarding this Agreement are under Polish law and nonexclusive jurisdiction of Polish courts (for users in the EU and rest of the world, excluding the USA) and Californian law and jurisdiction (for users in the USA only).<br><br>  <br><br>You always enjoy the protection of the mandatory provisions of the law that are applicable to you as a consumer and which would be applicable in the absence of the choice of law and court.<br><br>  <br><br>For users in the USA only Californian law and jurisdiction will be applicable. |
| 20\. CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION<br>--------------------------------------------<br><br>20.1.If you have concerns, claims or issues with us, we hope we can resolve them quickly and amicably. Please contact us [here](https://support.gog.com/hc/pl/requests/new?category=info&product=gog). We will make reasonable and good faith efforts to resolve any dispute between us informally. We undertake to answer any claim within 14 days.<br><br>  <br><br>20.2. If it is not resolved during this time, the next steps depend on where you live. If you live within the EU you may submit your legal claims to the online dispute resolution platform operated and provided by the European Commission which can be accessed via http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/ in order to reach an out of court settlement or initiate a lawsuit. You may also choose to resolve your dispute through any out-of-court dispute settlement body certified by your country’s Digital Services Coordinator.<br><br>  <br><br>20.3. If you live in the USA or the rest of the world (but not the EU) then please contact us at [legal@gog.com](mailto:legal@gog.com). | If you live in the EU and have any concerns or issues please contact us [here](https://support.gog.com/hc/requests/new). We hope we can resolve any complaints with you through informal dispute resolution. |
| 21\. OTHER LEGAL STUFF<br>----------------------<br><br>21.1 If any part of this Agreement is found not to be legally enforceable, this will not affect any other part of it.<br><br>  <br><br>21.2 This Agreement (including any GOG additional terms referenced in it) constitutes the entire agreement between you and us and supersedes any earlier oral or written agreements. If you disagree with this, please contact us as soon as possible after you start using GOG services at legal@gog.com since otherwise this will be binding on you after a reasonable time period (usually 30 days).<br><br>  <br><br>21.3 This Agreement governs our relationship with you (and vice versa). It does not create any rights for anyone else.<br><br>  <br><br>21.4 Please remember we are subject to various laws and we may be required to comply with law enforcement or other legal requirements.<br><br>  <br><br>21.5 If there is a reorganization, sale or merger of GOG then we may need to work with relevant third parties to transfer or merge your GOG account.<br><br>  <br><br>21.6. You and we agree that the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this Agreement.<br><br>  <br><br>21.7 We can assign, subcontract or transfer this Agreement to a third party or another member of our group if necessary for the support of GOG, as part of any reorganization or merger or for other business reasons. We will notify you if this happens.<br><br>  <br><br>21.8. If you are a European Union citizen, then please be aware that GOG has enabled cross-border portability on free and paid content pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2017/1128 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2017 on cross-border portability of online content services in the internal market, but this is subject to any other legal requirements on GOG including regarding IP protection and may also be subject to any requirements of developer and publisher partners of GOG. | This section sets out a few additional, hopefully self-explanatory rules about how this Agreement works legally.<br><br>  <br><br>This Agreement, and our Privacy Policy together are the contract between us and you. If anything is missing, contact us ASAP otherwise it will legally bind you. |
| 22\. CHANGES TO THIS AGREEMENT<br>------------------------------<br><br>22.1 We may change this Agreement if we think it's necessary, e.g. for legal reasons or to reflect changes in GOG services or GOG content. If so, we will make the changed Agreement available online at https://support.gog.com/hc/articles/212632089 and (if you have a GOG account) we will email you to let you know about any significant changes.<br><br>  <br><br>22.2 Any changes to the Agreement will come into force within 30 days of their announcement online. In the meantime, you're welcome to contact us at legal@GOG.COM if you have specific questions about the changes.<br><br>  <br><br>22.3 If you don't agree to those changes (regardless of whether you email us), then unfortunately we must ask you to cease using GOG services and GOG content. We're sorry we have to say that, but we hope you'll appreciate that for GOG services to work properly we need to have everyone using it under the same rules instead of different people having different rules. That's why we encourage you to get in contact if you have queries or concerns.<br><br>  <br><br>22.4 Just so you know, we'll never just make a bunch of changes to this Agreement, not tell you what they are and force you to agree to changes you don't understand before you can use GOG services! | We can change this Agreement but if we do we'll put the changed version online and normally it will take effect a reasonable time period afterwards. We’ll also email you (if you have a GOG account).<br><br>  <br><br>If you have any problems with our changes, please contact us so we can talk to you. Don't just ragequit on us! |
