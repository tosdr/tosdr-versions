Some of that billing data may be shared with us in order to detect and prevent fraud, help with customer support, or used as a record of your payment for accounting, taxation, and invoicing purposes. This data is what we call “billing data” and it may include your email address, the product (subscription you purchased) and for how long, and payment information.  
We never collect or store your credit card number.

#### Data collected when you contact us
