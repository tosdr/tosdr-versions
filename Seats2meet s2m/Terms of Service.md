**Terms and Conditions**
------------------------

Last update: February 18th 2019  
 

These are the Terms and Conditions for Seats2meet.com International B.V., located at Moreelsepark 65 in Utrecht, registered by the Dutch Chamber of Commerce by registration number 50516167. 

These Terms and Conditions apply to the general use of the website, the Seats2meet.com platform and the booking of Meetingspaces and Workspaces. When you make a booking at a location, you enter into a transaction with the location Operators, which is separate entity from Seats2meet.com that operates under these same Terms and Conditions.

| **1\. The agreement** |     |
| 1.1 | By accepting these Terms and Conditions and finishing the account registration process, you will enter into agreement with Seats2meet.com. You can terminate this agreement at any time by deleting your account. |
|     |     |
| **2\. Use of the software** |     |
| 2.1 | To register an account and to use the Seats2meet.com software we need you to provide accurate information about yourself. |
| 2.2 | You must secure access to your account by protecting your username and password. If you think someone else has access to your account, please contact us. |
| 2.3 | It is not permitted to use the software in a manner that causes hindrance or a nuisance for other users. In addition, you must not use the software in any way that is unlawful, illegal or harmful or for any purpose or activity in connection thereto. |
| 2.4 | We can remove any content that you share and take actions against your account, if you are in breach of this agreement. This may include disabling your account. We will notify you if we do so. |
|     |     |
| **3\. Booking conditions: Workspace or Meetingspace** |     |
| 3.1 | _Workspace booking conditions:_ Unless communicated otherwise, workspaces are available for booking without making a financial transaction in exchange of Social Capital (See item 5 in these terms). Some location operators do charge for the workspace they offer. In this case: if you cancel your booked workspace until 24 hours before the starting time of your reservation, we will not charge any cancellation fees. If you cancel within 24 hours before a reservation, a location operator may charge you a small cancellation fee. |
| 3.2 | _Meetingspace booking conditions:_ Meetingspaces can be booked in exchange for social capital and a financial transaction, unless communicated otherwise. You can cancel your booked seats until 24 hours before your booking. After this period of time your booking at the location is final and you will be charged the fee for the Meetingspace. Immediately after you have booked, you will receive a booking confirmation by e-mail. Moreover, you will receive two e-mails from us, one week and 48 hours before the starting time of your booking. These e-mails contain extra confirmation and the option to immediately change your booking or to cancel it. |
|     |     |
| **4\. Freedom to change your booking anywhere, anytime** |     |
| 4.1 | You are free to change your booking online at Seats2meet.com up to 24 hours in advance. |

|     |     |
| **5\. Your Seats2meet Passport: control over your personal data** |     |
