Privacy Statement
-----------------

This Privacy Statement was most recently revised on February 1st 2019.

  
On the Seats2meet.com website and platform we may acquire certain personal data from you. We deem careful handling of your personal data very important. Personal data are therefore carefully processed and secured in accordance with the requirements for the processing of personal data as laid down in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In this Privacy Statement, we explain which personal data we collect and use and for what purposes. If you wish to know more details about how we process personal data, please visit [gdpr.seats2meet.com](https://gdpr.seats2meet.com/)  
 

**1\. You are in control of your personal data with your Profile Passport**  
Seats2meet provides you a Profile Passport (your user account) that enables you to take full control over the personal data you provide us and share on our platform. We guarantee that your personal data will not be sold to any third party without your explicit consent.

From your Passport you can:

view your personal data;

* correct, improve and amend your personal data;
* restrict our possibilities to to communicate with you and to monitor your use of our services. Note that these restrictions may affect our ability to service you to the best of our abilities;
* delete your profile and remove your personal data.

If you wish to extract your personal data, Seats2meet.com can provide you with this data in a generic/simple exchange format upon a request at [privacy@seats2meet.com](mailto:privacy@seats2meet.com).  
 

**2\. Which personal data we collect, when, why and for how long**  
At Seats2meet.com we process your bookings for Meetingspaces and Workspaces and seek to facilitate serendipitous exchanges between you and the other users of our services and visitors of our locations. 

We collect personal data during the following interactions:

* When you visit our webpages and you are **not logged** in: we collect anonymous usage statistics that help us to monitor the platform. We use Google Analytics cookies to do so, but these are not relatable to natural persons and therefore don’t require your consent. Please see below under 8 and our Cookie Statement for more information. We do so to continue improvement and development of our platform.
* When you **create bookings on our platform**: based on our contract, your Meetingspace and Workspace Booking and Billing details that are needed to fulfil your booking request are stored in your Profile Passport until you delete your account, or two years after your last activity. We do so to deliver our services and products. Additionally, we store your Billing details for seven years. We are required to do so by law for the Dutch tax authority.
* When you **register an account and create a Profile Passport for our services**: on the basis of our contract, a profile is created containing your name, surname, e-mail address, profile image, billing address, telephone number, links to social media profiles and tags that describe your areas of expertise. We do so to deliver our services and products. Your Profile Passport is stored until you delete your account or two years after your last activity.
* The **Serendipity Machine** is part of your Profile Passport: through your Profile Passport, you get matched by an AI driven algorithm to other users, locations, events, content and questions made by the S2M ecosystem. Your matches are based on your use of the S2M ecosystem. We use the Serendipity Machine to provide our services and products to you: to facilitate serendipitous encounters and connections between users and to facilitate knowledge exchange between users. This information is also stored until you delete your account or two years after your last activity. You have the right to object to our profiling activities. This may mean that you cannot longer use our service since this way of profiling is part of the actual service. Please contact our Data Protection Officer (privacy@seats2meet.com) if you wish to do so.
* After **logging in with your Profile Passport**: we work with **Google Analytics** to monitor individual navigation behaviour on our platform to adequately understand how our services are being used. More specific information about this is given below under 8. We do so to continue improvement and development of our platform.
* When you **check in** on our platform: by checking in on a location, your temporal presence at this location, your tags and your function will be visible to other users:
    * when they visit the Seats2meet.com Ecosystem map;
    * when they receive suggested profile matches;
    * on a screen that is available in a public area of the Working spaces (only on some locations).You can either physically check in at the location, or from the Seats2meet.com website. When you provide us with your location coordinates upon our request, you consent to sharing your location with Google Maps. We store this data until you delete your account, two years after your last activity or until you withdraw your consent.
* When you **connect with other users, send messages** and **ask questions with your Profile Passport in the S2M ecosystem**: these interactions are stored and combined by us to provide relevant / tailored suggestions we make to you when you use our platform. This information is also stored until you delete your account, or two years after your last activity.
