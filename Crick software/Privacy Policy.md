[](https://goldilockscreative.xyz/cricksoft/en-gb/)

\[seopress\_breadcrumbs\]

This privacy policy sets out how Crick Software uses and protects any information that you provide us with when using any of our websites, our apps or our computer software.

Crick Software is committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. Should we ask you to provide certain information by which you can be identified, you can be assured that it will only be used in accordance with this privacy statement.

Crick Software may change this policy by updating this page. You should check this page from time to time to ensure that you are happy with any changes. This policy incorporates changes due to the General Data Protection Regulations (EU GDPR) 2018 and the UK GDPR 2021. These regulations give companies six lawful reasons for processing your data. These are:

1. Consent
2. Contract
3. Legal obligation
4. Vital interest
5. Public task
6. Legitimate interest

* Using your information to contact you for market research purposes
* Using the information to customise our websites according to educators’ interests

### Automated processing of data

* We automatically collect certain information to track visitor activity on our websites. We use this information to improve the content of our sites as well as to provide visitors with a more relevant overall experience with our organisation and our site. This information may include information that identifies you as an individual or relates to an identifiable individual, including; name, title, company name, job function, expertise, postal address, telephone number, or email address. We may also collect other information that does not reveal your specific identity or does not directly relate to an identifiable individual such as browser and device information, information collected through cookies, pixel tags, and other technologies, and demographic information. We never share this information or information you provide us with third parties except to the extent necessary to provide our service.
* If you fill out a web form on our site, your information will be stored in our CRM system and some of your past browsing on our site may be available to us to determine your interests.

However, if you use private browsing as described below, you may provide us your information without making your past browsing activity available to us. If you do not wish for us to have your personal information, please do not fill out any of the web forms on this site.
* If you provide your email address we will process your data as “legitimate interest.” If we contact you, some information is collected about when/if the email was opened and what links were clicked. This information is used to assess the engagement and success of an email campaign.

    \- View your email address (used to identify the user for licensing the app)  
    \- View your basic profile info (user’s name)

This information is used and displayed in [http://apps.cricksoft.com](http://apps.cricksoft.com/) to make it simpler for a school to manage their subscriptions and decide which users to add or remove.

We will delete your email address and basic profile info after 2 years of not using our service.

Crick Software Inc. Does not own any pupil data and the data collected is for licensing purposes only. This data is owned by the user and can be requested for deletion at any time.

**Disclosing your information**  
We will not disclose your personal information to any other party other than in accordance with this Privacy Policy unless we are legally required to do so by law.

In addition, once a subscription has expired for more than 24 months, the pupil personal information is deleted from our records.

Data breach policy
==================

_Overview_
----------

As an organisation that processes personal data, Crick Software must ensure appropriate measures are in place to protect against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data. The General Data Protection Regulation specifies that all breaches (except those **‘unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons'**) should be reported to the Information Commissioner. In the event of a data breach or an information security incident, it is important that appropriate actions are taken to promptly report the breach to the Data Protection Team who will manage the incident and minimise associated risks. This procedure is designed to set out the process that should be followed to ensure a consistent and effective approach is in place for managing a data breach and ensure that:

* Data breach events are detected, reported and monitored consistently
* Incidents are assessed and responded to appropriately
* Action is taken to reduce the impact of a breach
* Relevant breaches are reported to the Information Commissioner within the 72-hour window
* Improvements are made to prevent recurrence
* Lessons learned are communicated to the wider organisation

Incident response policy
========================

Despite explicit guidelines for securing confidential electronic data, breaches can still occur. At such times, it is important that Crick Software respond as quickly as possible. Computer thefts or loss should be reported immediately to line manager. Steps that we will take in the event of a data security breach are as follows:

### **1\. Determination of the nature and scope of a breach**

* Identification of the person reporting the breach (name, contact info, etc.)
* Record of the location, timeframe, and apparent source of the breach
* Preliminary identification of confidential data that may be at risk

### **2\. Communication**

* Data protection team
* Law enforcement (depending on the nature/scope of theft)

### **3\. Investigation**

* Identify ongoing vulnerability of data to exposure from breach source (take immediate steps to address)
* Conduct preliminary analysis
* Prepare inventory of data at risk
* Determine if exposed data were encrypted
* Identify security measures that were defeated (and by what means)

### **4\. Assessment of breach**

* Identify affected individuals at risk of identity theft or other harm
* Assess financial, legal, regulatory, operational, reputational and other potential institutional risks

### **5\. Remediation**

* Implement password changes and other security measures to prevent further data exposure
* Determine if exposed/corrupted data can be restored from backups; take appropriate steps
* Determine if value of exposed data can be neutralized by changing account access, ID information, or other measures

### **6\. Notification**

Based on the assessments above, the Data Protection Team will decide whether the breach incident needs to be reported to the ICO or the data subjects. Either way, the breach will need to be added to the breach log to include the following points:

* Nature and scope of breach
* General circumstances of the breach (e.g., stolen laptop, hacked database, etc.)
* Approximate timeline (e.g., date of breach discovery)
* Steps that Crick Software has taken to investigate and assess the breach
* Any involvement of law enforcement or other third parties
* Appraisal of any misuse of the missing data
* Steps we are taking to prevent future breaches of this nature

### **7\. Post-incident follow-up**

Following a data security breach, Crick Software will:

* Take steps to ensure that missing data cannot be used to access further information from our servers
* Pursue with law enforcement all reasonable means to recover lost data and equipment
* Review and modify as needed; all procedures, governing systems, administration, software management, database protections, access to hardware, etc., to prevent future data breaches of a similar nature
* Take appropriate actions if staff negligence or other’s behaviour contributed to the incident
* Modify procedures, software, equipment, etc. as needed to prevent future data breaches of a similar nature
* Take appropriate action if personnel negligence caused or contributed to the incident
