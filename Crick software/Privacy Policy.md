* Updating or adding your details to our customer database
* Using the information to improve our products and services
* Sending promotional emails to educators about new products, special offers or other information which we think you may find interesting, using the email address that you have provided. We do not send these to student email addresses.
* Using your information to contact you for market research purposes
* Using the information to customise our websites according to educators’ interests

### Automated processing of data

* We automatically collect certain information to track visitor activity on our websites. We use this information to improve the content of our sites as well as to provide visitors with a more relevant overall experience with our organisation and our site. This information may include information that identifies you as an individual or relates to an identifiable individual, including; name, title, company name, job function, expertise, postal address, telephone number, or email address. We may also collect other information that does not reveal your specific identity or does not directly relate to an identifiable individual such as browser and device information, information collected through cookies, pixel tags, and other technologies, and demographic information. We never share this information or information you provide us with third parties except to the extent necessary to provide our service.  
    
* If you fill out a web form on our site, your information will be stored in our CRM system and some of your past browsing on our site may be available to us to determine your interests. We may use this information to more effectively engage with you and improve our site. However, if you use private browsing as described below, you may provide us your information without making your past browsing activity available to us. If you do not wish for us to have your personal information, please do not fill out any of the web forms on this site.  
    
* If you provide your email address we will process your data as “legitimate interest.” If we contact you, some information is collected about when/if the email was opened and what links were clicked. This information is used to assess the engagement and success of an email campaign.  
    
* Clicking on a link in any of these emails may cause you to be personally identified on our site and may cause some part of your past browsing history on our site to be available to us so we may more effectively engage with you and improve our site. If you do not wish for this tracking to occur, you can unsubscribe from our mailings or use private browsing mode to avoid tracking.  
    
* We never use visitor identification techniques that involve sharing information you provide us with other sites or vice versa. We never store any information in your computer’s Flash local shared objects area (i.e., we never use what is known as ‘flash cookies’).

* * *

_Software and apps  
_
----------------------

### Windows/Mac software

We do not collect data in any of our products. Our applications are installed onto client computers and users’ work is saved locally, except in network installation where it is saved to a shared folder on your server. You will specify the shared folder during the installation process.

### iPad apps  

The iPad apps are downloaded via the Apple App Store and all information about who the app belongs to is linked to your Apple ID and is held by Apple. Our apps do not collect or share information.  

### Chromebook apps

For information regarding the data collected when using the Chromebook apps please click on the button below.

Click here  Click here   
  

The Chromebook apps use your Google ID and Google domain to install. We collect your Google email address as your unique identifier. This address is used to determine the status of your current license.

**User settings**  
We use cookies, local storage and your Google™ account to store user’s settings.

**Students and personally identifiable information**  
The only student information that we store is the student’s email address and basic profile info. This is required to confirm that they are a licensed user.

**Required permissions**  
Applications that integrate with a Chrome or a Google account must declare their intent by [requesting permissions](https://support.google.com/chrome_webstore/answer/186213?hl=en-GB). These permissions to your browser and account must be granted in order to integrate with Chrome and Google accounts. Below is a list of these permissions and why they are required. At no time will Crick Software request or have access to your Google account password.

* Gmail  
    \- Send email on your behalf (allows the app to send an email when the option is selected by the user)
* Google Drive  
    \- View and manage the file in your Google Drive (allows the user to manage their Google Drive files from within the app)
* Basic account info  
    \- View your email address (used to identify the user for licensing the app)  
    \- View your basic profile info (user’s name)
* Device Camera (allows the app to use the camera when the option is selected by the user)

You can revoke these permissions at any time on your Google [Account Permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions) page, however if you do this, the Crick Chromebook apps will cease to work.

**Data privacy**  
Crick Software employees will only access content on our servers to manage licensing for the Chromebook apps. The customer information visible to Crick Software employees is:

* School/organisation details  
    
* Users’ email addresses and basic profile info  
    
* Date when users started using the service  
    
* Date when users last used the app  
    
* Log of licensing requests (includes timestamp and a device identifier)

This information is used and displayed in [http://apps.cricksoft.com](http://apps.cricksoft.com/) to make it simpler for a school to manage their subscriptions and decide which users to add or remove.

We will delete your email address and basic profile info after 2 years of not using our service.

**Disclosing your information**  
We will not disclose your personal information to any other party other than in accordance with this Privacy Policy unless we are legally required to do so by law.

**Scanning content**  
We do not scan any content. Our systems are not designed to associate personal information with your activities.

**Personal information protection**  
Our sites have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. These measures include the use of secure servers to collect the information, encrypted databases, storage of the information in non-public areas of the servers, and other measures as deemed reasonable and necessary. In addition, once a subscription has expired for more than 24 months, the student personal information is deleted from our records.

**Access to Student Personal Information**  
The only student information that we store is the student’s email address and basic profile info. This is required to confirm that they are a licensed user. If you would like to see what information we hold for you, a student or your child with a live subscription to our apps, email [Chrome@cricksoft.com](mailto:Chrome@cricksoft.com). We will first need to check that we have enough information to be sure of your identity. If we have any reason to doubt your identity, we will request official confirmation.

We will respond to you within 30 calendar days to provide you with the information. There will be no charge for complying with an access request for student personal information.

Data breach policy
==================

_Overview_
----------

As an organisation that processes personal data, Crick Software must ensure appropriate measures are in place to protect against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data. The General Data Protection Regulation specifies that all breaches (except those **‘unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons'**) should be reported to the Information Commissioner.  

In the event of a data breach or an information security incident, it is important that appropriate actions are taken to promptly report the breach to the Data Protection Team who will manage the incident and minimise associated risks.  

This procedure is designed to set out the process that should be followed to ensure a consistent and effective approach is in place for managing a data breach and ensure that:  

* Data breach events are detected, reported and monitored consistently
* Incidents are assessed and responded to appropriately
* Action is taken to reduce the impact of a breach
* Relevant breaches are reported to the Information Commissioner within the 72-hour window
* Improvements are made to prevent recurrence
* Lessons learned are communicated to the wider organisation

Incident response policy
========================

Despite explicit guidelines for securing confidential electronic data, breaches can still occur. At such times, it is important that Crick Software respond as quickly as possible. Computer thefts or loss should be reported immediately to line manager.  

Steps that we will take in the event of a data security breach are as follows:  

### **1\. Determination of the nature and scope of a breach**  

* Identification of the person reporting the breach (name, contact info, etc.)
* Record of the location, timeframe, and apparent source of the breach
* Preliminary identification of confidential data that may be at risk

### **2\. Communication**  

* Data protection team
* Law enforcement (depending on the nature/scope of theft)

### **3\. Investigation**  

* Identify ongoing vulnerability of data to exposure from breach source (take immediate steps to address)
* Conduct preliminary analysis
* Prepare inventory of data at risk
* Determine if exposed data were encrypted
* Identify security measures that were defeated (and by what means)

### **4\. Assessment of breach**  

* Identify affected individuals at risk of identity theft or other harm
* Assess financial, legal, regulatory, operational, reputational and other potential institutional risks

### **5\. Remediation**  

* Implement password changes and other security measures to prevent further data exposure
* Determine if exposed/corrupted data can be restored from backups; take appropriate steps
* Determine if value of exposed data can be neutralized by changing account access, ID information, or other measures

### **6\. Notification**  

Based on the assessments above, the Data Protection Team will decide whether the breach incident needs to be reported to the ICO or the data subjects. Either way, the breach will need to be added to the breach log to include the following points:

* Nature and scope of breach
* General circumstances of the breach (e.g., stolen laptop, hacked database, etc.)
* Approximate timeline (e.g., date of breach discovery)
* Steps that Crick Software has taken to investigate and assess the breach
* Any involvement of law enforcement or other third parties
* Appraisal of any misuse of the missing data
* Steps we are taking to prevent future breaches of this nature

### **7\. Post-incident follow-up**  

Following a data security breach, Crick Software will:

* Take steps to ensure that missing data cannot be used to access further information from our servers  
    
* Pursue with law enforcement all reasonable means to recover lost data and equipment  
    
* Review and modify as needed; all procedures, governing systems, administration, software management, database protections, access to hardware, etc., to prevent future data breaches of a similar nature  
    
* Take appropriate actions if staff negligence or other’s behaviour contributed to the incident  
    
* Modify procedures, software, equipment, etc. as needed to prevent future data breaches of a similar nature  
    
* Take appropriate action if personnel negligence caused or contributed to the incident
