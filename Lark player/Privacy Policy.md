WHAT INFORMATION DOES LARK PLAYERCOLLECT?
=========================================

The information we collect can be generally placed in two categories: 1) data on how the user uses our Services; 2) aggregate data on the content with which the user engages. We collect information to provide better Services to you—from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful or which LARK PLAYER videos you might like. The information we collect, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls. 

You understand and consent that we may provide and share the information to our partners, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal experience, but we never disclose information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally. 

When you are not signed in to a valid account, we use the unique identifiers tied to the application or device you are using to collect information. When you are signed in with a third party account, e.g., your Google Account, we use such a specific account to collect information. 

For greater certainty, whenever you interact with our website or apps, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, “cookie” information, and the page you requested. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your computer or mobile device that allow us to recognize your computer or device and tell us how and when the Services are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features. 

Whenever you interact with LARK PLAYER, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs. The information we collect includes:

1.   Services usage data. For example, this may include your age and gender, language you use, terms you search for, videos you watch, views and interactions with content and ads, voice and audio information when you use audio features, purchase activity, people with whom you communicate or share content, information regarding the version of our software you are using, the location from where you downloaded our software, how often you launch our software and which features you use. 

2.   Data on the quality of our Services. For example, this may include the interaction of your devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request and your connection between your phone and your computer. 

3.   Data on user downloads. For example, this may include information regarding the  data on user downloads, such as what app you downloaded, the app list of your device and your average download speed.

4.   Aggregate statistics on content. For example, this may include the number of contacts you have on your phone, how many contacts you have marked as favorites, and the number of apps, songs, videos, or other content you have on your phone. This information is only collected as aggregate data, without reference to you or your contacts’ identities.

5.   Hardware and software identification. For example, this may include the device type, settings and image resolution, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, the version of Android operating system, the size of your device’s screen and internal storage. We support over 500 different Android devices and this helps us reach decisions as to how to prioritize support for different kinds of hardware and software.

6.   Location information. We may collect information about your location when you use our Services. Your location can be determined by GPS, IP address, sensor data from your device, information about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices.

7\. Google User Data. When you connect Google Drive in the Apps, we need your email data and/or Google account identifier (“accountId”) from your Google profile in order to access your Google Drive files. Your email data and accountId are not transferred from your device.  

In order for the Apps to play,download and upload audio files you need to grant access for the Apps to your Google Drive files. Access of the Apps to files is limited to certain audio type files extensions (mp3, mp4, flac etc) . This list may vary between iOS and Android Apps, it also may change as the functional capabilities of the Apps evolve.

You can download and upload your audio files from the connected Google Drive account to your device and remove them anytime by using download and upload functions in the Apps. Apps do not share any information from your Google Drive account.

•     A few features to note:

1.   If you're using our software and it crashes, the crash report sent to our server may contain some information about the operating system that you use.

2.   If you download content via our desktop software, we store a copy to your computer so that the next time you connect your phone you don't have to download it again.

3.   If you provide us with your name and email address, we will use this information for the purpose of contacting you regarding our services and products. You may opt out of such communications at any time by unsubscribing through our Website or contacting us through one of the methods listed at the end of this policy.

Company does not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Information from children under the applicable age in your country or knowingly allow such persons to register unless it is upon the specific and highlighted consent of at least one of the parents or the legal representatives of the child. If you are a child as defined by any applicable law, please do not attempt to register for the Website or send any information about yourself to us without the permission of your parents or legal representatives, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No child may provide any personal information to the Company or on the Website without necessary permission from its parents or legal representatives. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to verify that the consent referred to above was given by the child’s representatives, considering available technologies. When we learn that we have collected personal information from a child without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. Children’s personal data may be collected without the consent mentioned above when collection is necessary to contact the parents or the legal representatives, used one single time and not stored, or for their protection, and under no circumstances shall the data be passed on to third parties without consents as provided herein.

•     Any of the content of your text messages, either sent or received

•     Your music, photos, video, or any contents you download via our Services

•     Your sensitive personal data concerning racial or ethnic origin, religious belief, political opinion, trade union or religious, philosophical or political organization membership, data concerning health or sex life, genetic or biometric data, when related to a natural person

We will generally retain information for as long as required, allowed or for as long as we believe it useful. Even if the processing of personal data is terminated, we may continue to use and disclose your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy as amended from time to time to the extent allowed by applicable laws for purposes of a) compliance with a legal or regulatory obligation by the controller; b) transfer to third parties; or c) exclusive use of the controller, with access by third parties being prohibited, and provided the data has been anonymized.   

 If you are located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or United Kingdom, we will process the  user's personal information in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation.

We do not purport to have listed all possible disclosures that we might make. This Privacy Policy is intended to help you understand our general practices. This policy is not a promise that your information will never be disclosed except as described above. For example, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access information transmitted to or contained on the site, technologies may malfunction or not work as anticipated, or someone might access, abuse or misuse information, despite a lack of permission. Although we use what we believe to be commercially reasonable practices to protect your privacy, that does not mean, and you should not expect it to mean, that your information or communications will always be private or protected.
