Terms of Service

Last updated: March 2023

I. Your Relationship with Us and Acceptance of the Terms

Welcome to Lark Player (the “Platform”), which is provided by WEGITAL HK LIMITED. (the “Company”, “we” or “us”).

You are reading the terms of service (the “Terms”), which govern the relationship and serve as an agreement between you and us and set forth the terms and conditions by which you may access and use the Platform and our related websites, services, applications, products and content (collectively, the “Services”). Your access to certain Services or features of the Services may be subject to age restrictions and not available to all users of the Services. For purposes of these Terms, “you” and “your” mean you as the user of the Services.

Unless you accept the Terms, you have no right or authorization to use any part of the Services which requires you to be a Registered User. By accessing our Services or using our Services, you confirm that you can form a binding contract with us, that you accept these Terms and that you agree to comply with them. You understand and agree that we will treat your access or use of the Services as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards. Your access to and use of our Services are also subject to our Privacy Policy, which is incorporated herein by reference. By accessing the Services, you agree and represent to us:

i) that you are at least 12 years of age, or the statutory age of majority in your state of nationality and residence, whichever is higher;

ii) that you are not restricted from using the Services, by law, by contract, or by us;

iii) that you fully agree with the terms and conditions set forth in the Terms;

iv) where necessary, your legal guardian has reviewed and consented to these Terms and agreed to be responsible for any of your liability arising hereof.

Your fundamental rights as a Registered User to the Services are mainly set forth in the Terms, so please read all of the terms and conditions carefully. The Terms include a clause of dispute resolution by arbitration on an individual basis. The venue of such arbitration may not be in the country where you reside.

Please note that our services are not made available in, or to residents of, the European Union or Switzerland.

II. Changes to the Terms

Due to fast-developing technologies and law and policies, as well as volatile market conditions, the Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify or revise the Terms from time to time at any time, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to be bound by such modifications or revisions. Any such modified or revised version will be effective at the time we first post it onto our Platform (or at any other time designated in the terms of such version, if any). We will use commercially reasonable efforts to generally notify all users of any material changes to these Terms, such as through a notice on our Platform. However, you should look at the Terms regularly to check for such changes. We will also put the “Last Updated” date at the top of the Terms, which reflects the effective date of such Terms. Your continued use of the Services thereafter will constitute your acceptance of, and consent to, such modifications or revisions. If you object to any such modification or revision, your sole recourse shall be ceasing to use all of the Services.

These may be gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of the Services, inclusive of customer service, technical support, and other services to you (if any) related to the Services. The Company may use this information to improve its products or to provide services or technologies to you or third parties, as long as it is in a form that is not capable of personally identifying you.

4\. Except for the permissions and rights expressly granted in the Terms, no other licenses or rights are granted to you by implication or otherwise under the Terms.

5\. Your Account

A. You need to log in with a third-party account before you use our Services.

B. When you access some part of the Services, you may be prompted to provide us certain information of you, or log-in with an existing Account. You represent and warrant that the information you provide to us at any and all times will be true, accurate, current, and complete. If any such information changes, you agree to forthwith update such information to us. You become a registered user (“Registered User”) of our Services once you log in with your third-party account or phone number and cease to be a Registered User when you no longer maintain an Account with us.

C. You may choose a combination of certain characters (letters, digits and other characters) unused by other users as your nickname. We reserve the right to restrict the use of certain such combinations for legal compliance purposes or prevention of personal attack, humiliation, intellectual property rights infringement or other improper use of the Account.

You are primarily responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials (including without limitation your account number (ID), username, password) and are fully responsible for all activities that occur through the use of your credentials or otherwise on or through your Account. You agree to notify us immediately if you believe the confidentiality of your login credentials has been compromised or if you suspect any unauthorized use of your Account. You agree that we will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from unauthorized use of your login credentials.

The loss and damage arising thereof, including but not limited to the loss of communication, data and virtual properties, shall be assumed solely by the user.

F. For safety, compliance, operational or other concerns, and on a reasonable ground (for example, the Account is inactive for a long period and is wasting service resources), we reserve the right to suspend (freeze), terminate or reclaim your Account in our sole discretion, temporarily or permanently, with or without notice, giving reasons or not, and without any liability to you.

IV. LAWFUL AND PROPER USAGE OF THE SERVICES

i) removal of non-compliant content;

ii) restricting or terminating the provision of certain portions, features or functions of the Services to you;

iii) suspension or termination of your login, and/or limitation or denial of further service to you; and

VIII.TERMINATION AND MODIFICATION OF THE SERVICES

1.Termination and Interruption

A. You may apply for termination of your Account at any time and for any reason by sending an application to our customer service team. The Company may terminate your Account and your access to the Services if the Company finds your application reasonable and acceptable. The Company is not obliged to provide the Services unless required by applicable law. Therefore, the Company may terminate the Services in its entirety, or any part thereof, without giving a reason, notice, and compensation to you. The Company is not required to provide you with any notice or warning prior to any such termination. You may, as the result of the termination, lose your Account and all information and data associated therewith, and the Company is under no obligation to compensate you for any such loss.

B. The Company reserves the right to deny the access of any user to the Services without notice for any reason, including but not limited to a violation of the Terms. If you violate the Terms, the Company reserves the right to issue you a warning regarding the violation or immediately terminate or suspend any or all Accounts you have created using the Services. You agree that the Company needs not to provide you any notice before terminating or suspending your Account, but it may do so.

C. You understand that we need to perform scheduled or unscheduled repairs and maintenance of the Services. If such situations cause an interruption of Services for a reasonable duration, we shall not bear any liability to you and/or to any third parties. However, we shall provide notice to you as soon as practicable.

2.Modification

The Company reserves the right to change, modify, reprice, or discontinue (temporarily or permanently) the Services or any part thereof, with or without notice to you. You have the right to discontinue the use of the Services if you do not agree to such changes to the Services or the Terms made by us. Continued use of the Services shall be deemed as an acceptance of such changes.

IX. GOVERNING LAW AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION

1.Governing Law

By accepting the Terms or becoming a Registered User, you agree that the laws of Hong Kong, and regardless of your location, will govern the Terms and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and the Company.

2\. Dispute Resolution

A. Any dispute, controversy, difference or claim arising out of or relating to the Terms, including the existence, validity, interpretation, performance, breach or termination thereof or any dispute regarding non-contractual obligations arising out of or relating to it shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration administered by the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (“HKIAC”) under the HKIAC Administered Arbitration Rules in force when the notice of arbitration is submitted.

B. The seat of arbitration shall be Hong Kong. The number of arbitrators shall be one. The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in English.

C. If the arbitration clauses above are determined to be totally invalid or non-enforceable, then any dispute, controversy, difference or claim arising out of or relating to the Terms shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in Hong Kong, and you hereby consent to and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non-conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in the territory and the courts of Hong Kong.

D. You acknowledge that the rights granted and obligations made to the Company under the Terms are of a unique and irreplaceable nature, the loss of which may result in immediate and irreparable harm to the Company for which remedies at law are inadequate. The Company shall therefore be entitled to seek injunctive or other equitable relief (without the obligation to post any bond or surety) in the event of any breach or anticipatory breach by you. You irrevocably waive all rights to seek injunctive or other equitable relief.

3.User Disputes

You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Services and other parties that you come in contact with through the Services. The Company hereby disclaims any and all liability to you or any third party relating to your use of the Service. The Company reserves the right, but has no obligation, to manage disputes between you and other users of the Services.

X. MISCELLANEOUS

Entire Agreement. These Terms constitute the whole legal agreement between you and the Company and govern your use of the Services and completely replace any prior agreements between you and the Company in relation to the Services.

Links. You may link to our home page, provided you do so in a way that is fair and legal and does not damage our reputation or take advantage of it. You must not establish a link in such a way as to suggest any form of association, approval, or endorsement on our part where none exists. You must not establish a link to our Services in any website that is not owned by you. The website in which you are linking must comply in all respects with the content standards set out in the Terms. We reserve the right to withdraw linking permission without notice.

No Waiver. Our failure to insist upon or enforce any provision of these Terms shall not be construed as a waiver of any provision or right.

Security. We do not guarantee that our Services will be secure or free from bugs or viruses. You are responsible for configuring your information technology, computer programs, and platform to access our Services. You should use your own virus protection software.

Severability. If any court of law, having jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of these Terms is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the Terms without affecting the rest of the Terms, and the remaining provisions of the Terms will continue to be valid and enforceable.

Headings. The section headings used herein are for convenience only and shall not be given any legal import. Upon the Company’s request, you will furnish the Company with any documentation, substantiation, or releases necessary to verify your compliance with the Terms.

Survival. You agree that the provisions of the Terms that by their nature should survive termination will survive any termination of these Terms.

Class Action Waiver. Any Claim must be brought in the respective party’s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, representative, multiple plaintiffs, or similar proceeding (“Class Action”). The parties expressly waive any ability to maintain any Class Action in any forum. If the Claim is subject to arbitration, the arbitrator will not have authority to combine or aggregate similar claims or conduct any Class Action nor make an award to any person or entity not a party to the arbitration. Any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The parties understand that any right to litigate in court, to have a judge or jury decide their case, or to be a party to a class or representative action, is waived, and that any claims must be decided individually, through arbitration. If this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of the Arbitration Agreement, if otherwise effective, will be null and void. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, you and the Company each waive any right to a jury trial.

Third-Party Services and Rights. We use third-party services to help us provide the Services, but such use does not indicate that we endorse them or are responsible or liable for their actions. In addition, the Service may link to third-party websites to facilitate its provision of services to you. If you use these links, you will leave the Services. Some of these third-party websites may use Platform Materials under license from us. We are not responsible for nor do we endorse these third-party websites or the organizations sponsoring such third-party websites or their products or services, whether or not we are affiliated with such third-party websites. You agree that we are not responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as a result of any such dealings you may have on or through a third-party website or as a result of the presence of any third-party advertising on the Services. You hereby agree that we have the right to, when providing Services, place any type of commercial or non-commercial advertisement in any form or other types of commercial information (including, but not limited to, the placement of advertisements on any page of The Site); you also agree to receive promotional or other relevant commercial information from us via email, short message service (SMS) or other methods, to the extent permitted by applicable law. Nothing in the Terms shall be deemed to confer any third-party rights or benefits.

International Use and Export Control. The Terms may appear in different languages. If any discrepancy or inconsistency occurs between the versions of different languages, this English version shall always prevail. Downloading or using the software is at your sole risk. You hereby represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a Singapore government embargo, or that has been designated by the Singapore government as a “terrorist supporting” country; (ii) You are not listed on any Singapore government list of prohibited or restricted parties. Recognizing the global nature of the Internet, you agree to comply with all local rules and laws regarding your use of the Service, including as it concerns online conduct and acceptable content. Particularly, you may not use or otherwise export or re-export the Services and its components except as authorized by the United States (“U.S.”) law and the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Services were obtained. The software and applications comprise the Services may not be exported or re-exported into any U.S.-embargoed countries or to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department’s Specially Designated Nationals List or the U.S. Department of Commerce Denied Persons List or Entity List. By accessing and using the Services, you represent and warrant that you are not located in any such country or on any such list. You also agree that you will not use these products for any purposes prohibited by U.S. law, including, without limitation, the development, design, manufacture, or production of the nuclear, missile, or chemical or biological weapons.
