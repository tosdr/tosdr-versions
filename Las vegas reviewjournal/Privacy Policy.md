**Information automatically collected**

The LVRJ Services automatically log certain information about visits to the LVRJ Services, such as the number and frequency of visitors, technical information about browsers and devices used to access the LVRJ Services, and information about crashes or other technical issues. In addition, we and third parties may automatically collect certain information through automated means about your activities over time across the LVRJ Services as well as across third-party sites, apps or other media. The tools that collect this information vary depending on the LVRJ Services and include technologies such as cookies, web beacons, tags, scripts, pixels, local shared objects (including HTML5 cookies) and software development kits (“SDKs”). These technologies may be included in our web pages, mobile apps, emails, and other digital content and are as follows:

* **Cookies.** When you use the LVRJ Services, we may place small files, called “cookies” onto your computer. Cookies are data files that websites write onto computer hard drives for record keeping purposes when you visit them. The cookie file then identifies you as a unique user. Cookies make your use of the LVRJ Service more pleasing and efficient by “personalizing” your LVRJ Service experience and gathering website statistical data, such as which parts of the Website you have previously visited, what material you downloaded, your Internet provider’s domain name and country, and the addresses of websites you linked from immediately before and linked to immediately after the LVRJ Service. They enable us to tailor the information you receive and to assist our partners or other third party organizations with whom we have strategic alliances by identifying you as our customer or LVRJ Service user. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, unless you have configured yours not to accept them. You can program your browser not to accept cookies, but if you do, you may not be able to use certain portions of the Website and the Website will not be able to customize certain features according to your preferences.
* **Web Beacons.** Small graphic images or web programming code called web beacons (also known as “pixel tags” or “clear GIFs”) may be included on the pages of the Website and in email messages we send you. Web beacons or other similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes, such as to count visitors to the Website, or to count how many particular articles or links posted on the website were actually viewed.

While specific types of cookies and technologies may change from time to time as we improve and update the Services, cookies used by the Services generally fall into the categories below:

* **Security and Authentication (Strictly Necessary Cookies):** These cookies are essential to provide you with the Services and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas. Without these cookies, we can’t provide parts of the LVRJ Services that you request, like secure login accounts and transactional pages.
* **Performance & Functionality Cookies:** We use performance cookies to analyze how the LVRJ Services are being accessed and used, or how the LVRJ Services are performing in order to maintain, operate and continually improve the LVRJ Services about choices you’ve made and allow us to customize the LVRJ Services to you. When you continue to use or return to the LVRJ Services, we can remember choices you make (such as login credentials, language preference, country location or other online settings) and provide the personalized or enhanced features that you select.
* **Social Networks:** Some technologies help you to interact with social networks you are signed into while using the LVRJ Services, such as sharing content with the social network, logging in with the social network, and other features you employ with the social network, or that are allowed in the social network’s privacy policy. These may be set and controlled by the social networks, and your preferences with those social networks. You can manage your privacy preferences for these social networks and their tools and widgets via your account with the social network.
* **Advertising or Targeting Cookies:** These cookies allow us and third parties to gather information about the content you’re browsing, your visit, or your interaction with ads and our communications, and to display ads that are relevant to you and measure their effectiveness. Certain third party cookies may also track your activity across various sites to display ads relevant to you and your interests on third party sites and applications. Most advertising or targeting cookies set by the LVRJ Services belong to our service providers.

The tools may assign or collect unique cookie IDs or other identifiers associated with your browser or device. The tools may collect information while you are using our LVRJ Service or while they are running in the background of your device.

The information automatically collected may include:

* Information about your computer, device, browser and operating system (e.g., type, model, or version).
* Internet protocol (IP) address, which may be used to derive your general geographic area (e.g., city and country).
* Device identifiers (e.g., mobile advertising IDs).
* Information about your interactions with the LVRJ Services, including browsing activities and clickstream data that reflect the content you have accessed, clicked on, or viewed.
* Information about how you accessed the LVRJ Services, including details about websites or apps visited immediately before or after accessing a Digital Service.
* Demographic, interests and household information.
* Information about your interactions with email messages and other communications, such as whether you opened or forwarded the email or clicked on links contained in the email.

**Information we obtain from other sources**

We receive information about you from other sources and it may be combined with other information about you. For example, we may obtain data from:

* Operators of third-party sites or apps, content distribution channels and platforms (e.g., Roku, Amazon Fire TV), voice-activated assistants (e.g., Amazon Alexa, Google Home) or other devices and technologies when you interact with our content, products, services or ads available on those channels and platforms. The information we receive may include information about the content you view or access as well as your demographic information and information about your interests.
* Third-party data suppliers such as data aggregators, data resellers, public databases and business partners. They may provide us with demographic information, information about your purchases, and other information that helps us learn about you and other users of the LVRJ Services.
* Social Media Platforms and similar services (“Social Media Platforms”). When you engage with our content or ads on Social Media Platforms, or interact with features on the LVRJ Services that contain content or features provided by Social Media Platforms (e.g., login or sign in features or tools that allow you to share our content with others on Social Media Platforms), we may obtain information from Social Media Platforms, including your username, user ID, demographic information and other information, subject to the settings and privacy practices of the relevant Social Media Platform. We may obtain this information directly from the Social Media Platform or through plug-ins, integrations or applications. Please keep in mind that the operators of the Social Media Platforms may also gather information about your use of the LVRJ Services and their features and tools.

**HOW WE USE INFORMATION WE OBTAIN**

If you make a purchase or place an order through or in connection with an LVRJ Service, through our third-party processor Authorize.net, we use your payment card information (e.g., your card number and expiration date) for limited purposes such as to process your transaction (including recurring payments, if applicable), to provide you with the requested products or services, and for the purposes described under the section “To protect our rights or the rights of others” below.

* Interest-based advertising (also known as targeted or personalized advertising or ads) is advertising based on your interests as inferred from your activities over time on the LVRJ Services and online services operated by third parties, as well as information from other sources. Interest-based ads may consist of text ads, images, animations or videos and may be displayed to you based on various factors, including the context of the site or app in which they appear (e.g., business or sports section), information you provided to the operator of the site or app (e.g., when you created an account), your activities on the site or app (e.g., pages viewed, searches performed or ads clicked), and information such as your demographic, interests and household information.
* On the LVRJ Services and on third-party sites, apps or other media, we, our service providers and third parties may use automated means to (a) collect information for interest-based advertising purposes or (b) serve you interest-based ads. These automated means vary depending on the LVRJ Services and include technologies such as cookies, web beacons, tags, scripts, pixels, local shared objects (including HTML5 cookies) and SDKs (software development kits). These technologies may use unique identifiers associated with your browser or device to support interest-based advertising.

We may aggregate the information we obtain to create audiences that are most likely to respond to ads based on demographic, interests or household information.

* Cross-device linking. If you access the LVRJ Services from multiple browsers or devices, we, our service providers and third parties may try to establish connections among and link the different browsers and devices you use to access the LVRJ Services and our content or ads published elsewhere. This helps us provide you with a seamless experience across the browsers and devices you use and serve you with more relevant content and ads (e.g., so that we don’t show you the same article twice). See here for steps you can take to limit browser and mobile app tracking for interest-based advertising purposes.

To accomplish our legitimate interests, we may share your information with our affiliates and subsidiaries, service providers and business partners (including for our advertising and marketing purposes) and in the context of a corporate transaction. We maintain safeguards to protect the information we process to pursue our legitimate interests.
* **To comply with our legal obligations.**We process and share your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations when we use your information to protect our rights or the rights of others and when we share your information with other parties where required by law or as necessary to protect our rights. For example, we are required to collect certain information from you when processing your subscription payment for tax or financial reporting reasons.
* **With your consent.**We obtain your consent to process your information when we are required to do so by law. If consent is the legal basis on which we process your personal information, you can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us using the information provided in the “Contact Us” section above.

**Your Rights Over Your Information**

In certain circumstances, you may have certain rights regarding the use of your personal information, including the right to access or object to the use of personal information that we hold about you (including in relation to direct marketing). Under certain data privacy and protection laws or regulations, individuals also have the right to request that we rectify, update, erase, restrict or to share their personal information in a usable format with another company. All of these requests are subject to applicable law and whether or not such law is applicable to you and to us. We encourage you to contact us to update or correct your information if it changes or if the personal information we hold about you is inaccurate.  
If you would like to discuss or exercise such rights, please contact us at [privacy@reviewjournal.com](mailto:privacy@reviewjournal.com). We will contact you if we need additional information from you in order to honor your requests.

**Storing Your Information**

We will keep your personal information for as long as we have a relationship with you. Once our relationship with you has come to an end, we will retain your personal information for a period of time that enables us to:

* Maintain business records for analysis, understanding market trends and/or audit purposes and to improve the LVRJ Services.
* Comply with record retention requirements under applicable laws or other relevant legal or regulatory requirements.
* Defend, establish, exercise or bring any existing or potential legal claims.
* Carry out fraud detection and prevention.
* Deal with any complaints regarding the LVRJ Services, our products and services.

We will delete your personal information when it is no longer required for these purposes. If there is any information that we are unable, for technical reasons, to delete from our systems, we will put in place appropriate measures to prevent any further processing or use of the data.

**International Data Transfers**

Information collected through the LVRJ Services will be processed in and subject to the laws of the United States, which may not provide the same level of protection for your personal information as your home country. If we transfer personal data from the European Economic Area, UK and Switzerland, we will, where we are legally required, put in place appropriate safeguards which may include, to the extent required, the European Commission-approved standard contractual clauses. For more information on these safeguards, please contact us at the details provided in the “Contact Us” section above.

**Changes to the PRIVACY POLICY**

Where changes to this Privacy Policy have a fundamental impact on the nature of the processing or otherwise have a substantial impact on you, we will endeavor to give you advanced notice so that you have the opportunity to exercise your rights (e.g. to object to the processing).

**Privacy Officers and Complaints**

Our Privacy Officers can be contacted at [privacy@reviewjournal.com](mailto:privacy@reviewjournal.com).  
We are committed to working with you to obtain a fair resolution in the event you have a complaint or concern about privacy. If, however, you believe that we have not been able to assist with your complaint or concern, you have the right to make a complaint to a data protection authority.
