WHEN DOES THIS PRIVACY NOTICE APPLY?
------------------------------------

Philips Hue is not just a smart bulb. It is a smart lighting ecosystem. The Philips Hue system consists of different parts and functionalities which require different types of personal data processing.

This Privacy Notice covers our Philips Hue system. For example, it covers the following:

* when you visit or use our websites, applications or social media channels;
* when you create an account with us;
* when you purchase our products directly from our Philips Hue web shop;
* when you use our Philips Hue products, their functionalities or applications;
* when you subscribe to our newsletters, promotions or other marketing initiatives;
* when you contact or interact with our consumer care team; or
* when you otherwise interact with us or our system.

If you do not fall within the scope of this Privacy Notice for Philips Hue, your personal data will be governed by a different privacy notice. Were additional privacy terms or notices are applicable, we encourage you to read them. You can check our privacy notices in our [Signify Privacy Centre](https://www.signify.com/global/legal/privacy/legal-information). 

WHAT TYPES OF DATA DO WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU?
-------------------------------------------

Depending on how you interact with us (e.g. online, offline, over the phone, etc.) and what products you purchase from us, or how you use them, we do process different data about you.

If you choose not to share this data with us, we will not be able to provide you with the full functionality of our products, system or applications. For example, if you choose not to provide location permissions in your phone for our mobile application, our application will not be able to know when you are arriving home and therefore the home and away routines you configure - which depend on our mobile application understanding where you are located - will not work.

We also process your personal data if you voluntarily share it with us. This type of data will provide you with more personalized experiences. For example, the names you give to your Philips Hue products.
