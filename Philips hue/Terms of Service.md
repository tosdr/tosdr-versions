#### 15\. Safe Harbor' Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995  

The information on this website may contain certain forward-looking statements with respect to the financial condition, results of operations and business of Signify and certain of the plans and objectives of Signify with respect to these items. We caution readers that no forward-looking statement is a guarantee of future performance and that actual results could differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Examples of forward-looking statements include the statements we have made about our strategy, estimates of sales growth, future EBITA and cost savings, future developments in our organic business as well as the benefit of future acquisitions, and our capital position. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to future events and circumstances and there are many factors that could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. The forward looking statements are subject to, among other things, domestic and global economic and business conditions, the successful implementation of our strategy, our ability to identify and complete successful acquisitions and to integrate those acquisitions into our business, consumer preferences with respect to our existing and new products, our ability to develop and market new products, our ability to realize the benefits of this strategy , the policies and actions of governmental and regulatory authorities, changes in legislation, and the impact of competition – a number of which factors are beyond our control. As a result, our actual future results may differ materially from the plans, goals, and expectations set forth in such forward-looking statements. Additional risks and factors are identified in our documents filed with or furnished to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) including in our most recent Annual Report on Form 20-F, which is available on the SEC’s website at [www.sec.gov](https://www.sec.gov/). Any forward-looking statements made by or on our behalf speak only as of the date they are made. We do not undertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect any changes in expectations with regard thereto or any changes in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. The reader should, however, consult any additional disclosures that we have made or may make in documents we have filed or may file with the SEC.

#### 18\. No Waiver  

No failure on the part of Signify to enforce any part of these Terms of Use shall constitute a waiver of any of Signify' rights under these Terms of Use, whether for past or future actions on the part of any person. Neither the receipt of any funds by Signify nor the reliance of any person on Signify' actions shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of any part of these Terms of Use.
