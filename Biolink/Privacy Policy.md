We wrote this policy to help you understand what information we collect, how we use it and what choices you have about it. Since we’re an internet company, some of the concepts below are a little technical, but we’ve tried the best to explain them in a simple way. We welcome your questions and queries on this policy.  
​

We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. We use your Personal Information for providing and improving the Service. By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.  
​  
Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, accessible at [http://bio.link](http://bio.link/)  
​  
​

**Information Collection And Use**
----------------------------------

While using our Service, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you. The most common types of information we collect include: user-names, email addresses, IP addresses, payment information such as payment agent details (for paid plans),browser types, time zone settings, the time spent on webpages, unique device identifiers and other diagnostic data, your actions on our Sites (including any selections or inputs into items) and web and email analytics data. We may also collect and store information about your approximate location (e.g. your country) using geographic information from your IP address.

Where you give us consent to use the collected data:

* providing you with marketing information about products and services which we feel may interest you; and
    

* customising our services and websites, like advertising that appear on the Site – where this involves the use of cookies or similar technologies – in order to provide a more personalised experience.
    

* For purposes which are required by law.
    

* For the purpose of responding to requests by government, a court of law, or law enforcement authorities conducting an investigation.  
    ​

We use “cookies” to collect information. You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of our Service.

That said, when you visit our site, there’s certain information that’s recorded which is generally anonymous information and does not reveal your identity.

Before making your information publicly available or giving your information to anyone else, think carefully.

Please note that if you request the erasure of your personal information we will retain information from deleted accounts as necessary for our legitimate business interests, to comply with the law, prevent fraud, collect fees, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with investigations or requests by government, a court of law, or law enforcement authorities, enforce the terms of service and take other actions permitted by law. The information we retain will be handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

We do not collect any additional personal information from the images unless explicitly provided by you.
