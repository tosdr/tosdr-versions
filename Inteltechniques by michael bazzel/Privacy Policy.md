#### Privacy Policy

* * *

Our privacy policy is quite simple. We collect no information about our visitors and share no page access details with any third party. We do not use any type of web trackers or analytics, and we encourage you to verify this with a browser script blocker. Our main pages are coded in simple HTML. Our blog is a self-hosted WordPress installation, with all tracking code removed. There are no tracking cookies or any invasive files copied to your computer without your consent. We have no options that allow you to "like" or "tweet about" us on social networks. We never disclose any provided contact information obtained or stored to any entity. We do not see, collect, or store the information you search within the book's search tools. We truly respect your privacy.  
  
We currently maintain a few affiliate partnerships, including Amazon, ProtonMail, SLNT, and others. If you purchase items from these services through links in this website, the companies know that you were directed by us. We cannot see any personal information and we do not know your name or address. We receive absolutely no information about you or your order.  
  
We currently sell our digital guides through Sendowl. While we collect no analytic data from our internal pages, Sendowl collects some basic data about you and your order, including a browser cookie if you place an item into their "cart". We see the name and email you provide to them during checkout, but we do not see or store your full credit card information. Sendowl only shares that data with our credit card processor Stripe.  
  
We have never provided any internal customer, member, or visitor information to any entity. We will never share or sell any information to any third-party company. We have not received any court orders for any data. In 2021, our office received an email request for member search logs from a government agency. No details could be provided as we maintain no visitor usage logs, aside from temporary mandated page access statistics stored by our web host, which is flushed every 24 hours. As this was not an official U.S. court order, we did not respond.
