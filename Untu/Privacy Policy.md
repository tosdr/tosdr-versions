#### HEALTHCARE

Healthcare marketing held to a higher standard
==============================================

At Optimal, we combine the highest quality data and brand-safe inventory to deliver the most effective digital media solutions for consumer health brands and organizations. Fully-permissioned, transparent, and trustworthy, we protect patient privacy while creating the highest quality audiences anywhere.

##### 30MM

Patients in our permissioned panel

##### 750K

Medical professionals in our HCP panel

##### 250+

Individual patient condition segments

##### 5,500

Individual attributes in each audience model

Welcome to a more ethical – and effective – way of reaching your audiences.

#### Fully permissioned, opt-in audiences

While others create audiences surreptitiously, and without patient permission – we only use permissioned data that’s both HIPAA and NAI compliant. This protects the privacy of patients and consumers, while connecting you to the exact people you want to reach.

#### Data that goes way beyond demographics

Because our data is fully-permissioned, we can model and scale audiences using thousands of different attributes spanning demographic, geographic, attitudinal, behavioral, financial, retail, and political data.

#### 10x more accurate audiences

Precision matters. While others are required to build watered-down segments that reach tens of millions, our audiences are designed to reach only those consumers, patients, caregivers, and medical professionals you need to engage. It’s why our data is at least 10x more accurate than the competition.

#### Commitment to quality control and brand lift

We’ve made it our mission to make certain that our data can help you achieve your KPIs. Our stringent quality controls result in transparent, scaled audience segments that are 3x to 20x more likely to resemble the individuals in each seed audience we create. And, unlike the others, we never grade our own homework.
