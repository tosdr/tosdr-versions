From time to time, we may use or augment the personal information we have about you with information obtained from other sources, such as public databases, social media platforms and other third parties. For example, we may use such third party information to confirm contact information.

We may use the information we collect to provide our Services. We also collect, hold, use and disclose the information to:

* Communicate with you about our Services

* Respond to requests, questions, and comments

* Enable employment applications
* Comply with legal requirements, judicial process, and our policies 

We may also aggregate any personal information that we collect in connection with our Services, such that the information is no longer personally identifiable or attributable to you. We may use such aggregated information for our own legitimate business purposes without restriction.

### How We Share Your Information

We may share the information we collect:

* Within our company, our branded subsidiaries, joint ventures, and other companies in the United States under common control with us (collectively, “Affiliates”)

We reserve the right to transfer the information we maintain in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. If we engage in such a sale or transfer, we will make reasonable efforts to direct the recipient to use your personal information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. After such a sale or transfer, you may contact the recipient with any inquiries concerning the recipient’s privacy practices.

### Children’s Privacy

Our website is not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 on this website. In addition, we do not sell any personal Information of minors under 13 years of age.

### Cookies and Similar Technologies

We, our service providers, and our business partners may also collect certain information about the use of our website by automated means, such as cookies, web beacons, HTML5 localStorage, and other technologies.

Because there is not yet a consensus on how companies should respond to web browser-based do-not-track (“DNT”) mechanisms, we do not respond to web browser-based DNT signals at this time.

### Links to Other Websites and Third Party Content

We may link to other websites, services, and applications that are not operated or controlled by us (the “Third Party Services”). This Privacy Policy does not apply to such services. While we attempt to facilitate access only to those Third Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot take responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of those Third Party Services. We encourage you to review and understand the privacy practices of any Third Party Services before providing any information to or through them. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the Third Party Service that provides the feature.

### How We Protect Your Information

We maintain administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect personal information we maintain against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use.

### Changes to Our Privacy Policy:

We may update our Privacy Policy periodically. If we do make changes, we will post those changes on this Policy and indicate at the top of this page the date this Privacy Policy was last revised. Any changes will be effective only after the effective date of the change.
