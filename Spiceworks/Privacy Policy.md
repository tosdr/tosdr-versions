**13\. How to Change Your Preferences**
---------------------------------------

_Access to Your Personal Information_. Upon request Ziff Davis will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. You may access, correct, or request deletion of your personal information by logging into your account, contacting us through our [Privacy PortalOpens a new window](https://dsar.spiceworks.com/ "Opens a new window") , or emailing us at [privacy@spiceworks.com](mailto:privacy@spiceworks.com "Opens a new window"), regardless of your citizenship or location. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.

_Your Newsletter and Email Subscriptions_. You can opt out or unsubscribe to a newsletter or other email list at any time by following the instructions at the end of the newsletters or emails you receive. Please allow five to ten business days for changes to take effect. On some Services, member service-related communications are an integral part of such Services to which you subscribe and you may continue to receive emails as part of that particular portion of the Services unless you cancel your account, even if you opt out of the newsletters or email list. If you have provided more than one email address to us, you may continue to be contacted unless you request to unsubscribe each email address you have provided.

_Direct Mailings, Push Notifications, and Unsubscribing._  Where you have consented to receive marketing communications from us, we will send you emails and/or push notifications (depending on what you have consented to).  You may withdraw your consent for email marketing communications (i.e. unsubscribe) at any time by (i) clicking the “Unsubscribe” link in a marketing communication email we send you; or (ii) using the “Notifications” or “Settings” page in the account area.   You may withdraw your consent for web-related notifications (i.e. unsubscribe) at any time through your browser settings.  You may also withdraw your consent by emailing our support team(s) at the email addresses below.  Please allow two working days for this instruction to take effect in all of our systems.

_Opting Out of Tracking_. Currently, our Services do not recognize browser do-not-track signals. However, you may manage how your browser handles cookies and related technologies by adjusting its privacy and security settings. Browsers are different, so refer to instructions related to your browser to learn about cookie-related and other privacy and security settings that may be available. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. You can opt-out of being targeted by certain third party advertising companies by visiting the following links: [IAB opt-out platformOpens a new window](https://youronlinechoices.eu/ "Opens a new window") , [Network Advertising InitiativeOpens a new window](https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/ "Opens a new window") ,  [OmnitureOpens a new window](https://www.d1.sc.omtrdc.net/optout.html?omniture=1&popup=1&locale=en_US&second=1&second_has_cookie=0 "Opens a new window") , [Digital Advertising AllianceOpens a new window](https://www.aboutads.info/choices/ "Opens a new window") , [PrivacyChoiceOpens a new window](https://www.privacyfix.com/start/install "Opens a new window") , [BlueKaiOpens a new window](https://www.bluekai.com/consumers.php#optout "Opens a new window") , and [European Interactive Digital Advertising AllianceOpens a new window](https://youronlinechoices.eu/ "Opens a new window") .

_Social Media_.  You can manage the sharing of certain personal data when you register with us through a social media platform or application, such as through Facebook Connect or Google.  Please refer to the privacy settings of the social media platform or application to determine how you may adjust our permissions and manage the interactivity between us and your social media account. By registering with us through a social media platform, you grant us permission to access all of the elements of your social network profile information that you have chosen to share with us and to use it in accordance with the social media platform’s terms of use and this privacy notice.

_Location Based Services_. You may opt-out of having your Precise Location Data collected by Ziff Davis at any time by editing the appropriate setting on your mobile device (which is usually located in the Settings area of your device).

_California Residents_. In accordance with the California Online Privacy Protection Act, we may collect Personal Information about your online activities when you use the Services. While we give our users many avenues to opt out of providing Personal Information, we do not respond to Web browsers’ “do not track” signals. California’s “Shine the Light” law, Civil Code Section 1798.83, permits our users who are California residents to periodically request and obtain certain information about any Personal Information disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident and wish to make such a request or if you wish for us to refrain from gathering your Personal Information, please submit your request in writing to the contact details set out in Section 14 below.

_EU Residents_. GDPR provides certain rights for EU residents. You may decline to share certain information with us, in which case we may not be able to provide some of the features and functionality of the Services. These rights include, in accordance with applicable law, the right to object to or request the restriction of processing of your information, and to request access to, rectification, erasure and portability of your own information. Where we process your information on the basis of your consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent (noting that such withdrawal does not affect the lawfulness of any Processing performed prior to the date on which we receive notice of such withdrawal, and does not prevent the Processing of your Personal Information in reliance upon any other available legal bases). Requests should be submitted by contacting us using the [Privacy PortalOpens a new window](https://dsar.spiceworks.com/ "Opens a new window") . If you have any further questions upon receipt of your completed DSAR or if you would like to appeal in case your DSAR is denied, please resubmit a DSAR request using the DSAR form at [Privacy PortalOpens a new window](https://dsar.spiceworks.com/ "Opens a new window") and indicate it is an appeal, or email us at [privacy@spiceworks.com](mailto:privacy@spiceworks.com "Opens a new window"). If you are an EU resident and have any unresolved privacy concern, you have the right to contact the appropriate EU Supervisory Authority and lodge a complaint.

_Contact and Complaints._ If you are in the UK or EEA, you have the right to make a complaint to the relevant supervisory authority in your country, the details of which are available via the links below. We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach a supervisory authority, so please contact us in the first instance. Questions, comments and requests regarding this Privacy Policy are welcomed and may be addressed by (i) writing to us via the contact details set out in Section 14 below; or, (ii) email to [privacy@spiceworks.com](mailto:privacy@spiceworks.com "Opens a new window") with the words “FAO: the Legal Department” at the start of the message or directly to our DPO, who can be contacted at [dpo@spiceworks.com](mailto:dpo@spiceworks.com "Opens a new window").
