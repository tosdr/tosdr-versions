Terms & Conditions
==================

The following document outlines the terms and conditions for the next website.  
**Terms Correct as of 04/09/2024**  

 Your Order

### Orders and Contract

Your order for goods is accepted and a contract is formed between Next and you when we despatch the goods you have ordered and not before. A contract is not formed at the point in time that payment has been taken from you by Next, nor at the point in time that you receive an email from Next acknowledging receipt of your order. Until the goods are despatched the order may not be accepted by Next, or may be cancelled by you. Exceptions apply to orders for personalised items and goods made to your order which cannot be cancelled by you once you have received an email confirmation that your order has been received, as such items and goods may already be in production as a result of your order. For a full list of exceptions to items you can return please see under the heading [EXCEPTIONS TO THE RETURNS POLICY](#returns). For security reasons, until you have placed an order for goods, received your first statement and a payment has been received for those goods, you will be unable to order gift cards. For security reasons we may restrict the volumes of certain items to be sold in any one transaction. Following formation of the contract, Next shall continue to own any goods ordered until it has received payment in full from you, even though the goods may have already been delivered to you. Purchases from Next Online, or Little Label, including transactions on your nextpay or Directory Card in-store will be charged the day the goods are despatched/purchased in-store.

### Cancelling Your Order

Under Consumer Regulations you have the right to cancel your order as long as you do so no later than 14 days after the day on which you receive the goods or service. Please be aware that your right to cancel does not apply to certain goods that we sell, for example, items made or customised to your order, (such as photo gifts, made to measure curtains, fabric sold by the metre and personalised goods), fresh flowers, perishable food items, audio or DVD recordings, computer software and games, toiletries and cosmetics where the seal has been broken, or pierced jewellery items. You must inform us of your wish to cancel in writing either by letter, email or by using the cancellation form on the website or call 0333 777 8000# within a period of 14 days beginning on the day after the day you receive your goods. You must take reasonable care of the goods and not use them. You should return goods to us in their original packaging, wherever possible, within 14 days of informing us of your wish to cancel. If you return goods to us, we will not be responsible for any loss or damage to them during transit and we recommend that you use a recorded or secure delivery method. If goods are lost or damaged in transit, we may charge you, or not refund to you, amounts that are attributable to the loss or damage. See RETURNS section for details of how to return goods to us.

  

We cannot accept substitute or alternative items by way of returns, so please look closely at the items you return to us. We may send items back to you at our discretion. If you return or attempt to return substitute or alternative items, you will still be responsible for paying for the original item purchased and we reserve the right to charge an investigation fee of no less than £35 to cover the cost of our investigating the position. We can offset this amount due from other sums that may be due to you for refunds. Accepting returned goods and/or crediting an account does not constitute a waiver of our right to charge an investigation fee. For full details of your rights under the Consumer Protection Regulations, please contact your Citizens Advice Bureau or a Solicitor. For full details of how to return goods can be found in the RETURNS section. Additional terms and conditions apply to cancelling orders for certain goods such as made to order items, large items of furniture and domestic appliances. Please refer to the terms relating to the supply of those goods.

### Next High Returns Policy

Next may suspend or terminate your ability to place orders if we determine that the rate at which you return items (‘returns rate’), when compared to the number of items ordered and retained, is too high.

If you meet the criteria, we will notify you and work with you to improve your returns rate. We want you to continue shopping with us, but if your returns rate remains high, we may have to close your account. Should that happen, we will not be able to offer you an account in the future.

Next Credit Account Holders

Following notification of closure, if you have a balance remaining on your account, your available credit will be restricted, and we will ask you to pay your balance down in accordance with your monthly statements before closing your account.

Your credit agreement with Next states that we may suspend, restrict or terminate your right to draw on your credit account at any time for any objectively justified reason. We consider that a high returns rate may constitute such a reason.

 Next Experiences

The Next Experiences issues face value vouchers ("Vouchers") entitling the Holder to choose, up to the value stated on the Voucher, one of a range of activities supplied by the Next Experiences and provided by selected suppliers.

### Voucher Validity

Vouchers are valid for a minimum of nine months (excluding promotions). Please check the season of any intended activity, as this may be shorter than the Voucher validity. You will find the expiry date printed on the Voucher. You must book and complete your activity prior to the expiry date. If you are unable to use your Voucher within the validity period, the Voucher can be extended for a period of up to six months (excluding promotions). A Voucher can only be extended once and must be done while the Voucher is valid.

Extended Vouchers cannot be refunded. A £20 administration fee is payable if you choose to extend your validity.

### Choosing Your Activity

You may use your Voucher to book any of the activities from our website. If you have not already been provided with a Voucher for the type of activity you are interested in, or wish to change to another activity type, contact us on the number provided or via our website and you will be sent a Voucher for that activity. If appropriate, your original Voucher will be replaced.

Contact us again when you have decided which activity you wish to enjoy. A difference will be payable if the chosen activity costs more than the face value of your original Voucher and the value of your Voucher will be increased.

If your chosen activity is cheaper, we will hold the difference as a credit against another activity. In this case, the credit holds the same expiry date as the original Voucher.

Please note you may not be able to change your mind once a date has been booked with a supplier.

### Exchanging your Voucher

A Voucher can be exchanged only once for another Voucher, up to the face value stated on it and subject to the restrictions below, without incurring a fee. An administration fee of £20 will be charged for a second and final exchange, (as no more than two exchanges in total are permitted). If you wish to combine or merge more than one Voucher together, as part of the exchange process, then this can be arranged however subject to the following restrictions; You can merge no more than two Vouchers together; if the Vouchers have different expiry dates then the earlier expiry date is taken forward onto the replacement Voucher, not the later date; only Vouchers purchased from the same retail chain or website may be merged together; and you may not merge any Vouchers previously merged or exchanged.

Please note Next Experiences promotional products, tangible gift products and Weekend Gift Breaks products are excluded from the list of exchangeable products.

### Bookings

In order to enjoy your chosen activity and to arrange a time and place for your activity you are asked to choose your preferred location then follow the booking instructions on the Voucher pack.

You may be required to send your Voucher to the chosen provider to confirm your booking in advance: if so we recommend you keep a record of your Voucher number and use registered post, as your Voucher is a valuable document.

Customers should also note that your Voucher must be presented on the day, in order to participate in the activity. If lost, we regret that Vouchers cannot be replaced.

Please note you may not be able to change your mind once a date has been booked with a supplier.

### Description And Photography

We have tried hard to ensure that descriptions, illustrations and experience titles used in the Voucher packs, in all our literature and our website are accurate, however, photographs and experience titles are intended to give a general idea of the activity described, and do not form part of any contract between you and Next Experiences.

Please note depending on the location you choose the experience title may differ to that of experience title used by our suppliers, but this does not affect your entitlement as described in your Voucher pack.

### Insurance

Where applicable, the price of the Voucher includes the cost of providing you with personal accident insurance cover. This insurance cover is only included if indicated on your Voucher and is not available for activities that take place abroad. Full details of insurance cover are included in your information pack.

### Refunds

If you are not satisfied with your Voucher pack, please call us within 28 days of purchase and we will happily arrange a full refund on receipt of your unused and valid Voucher. Refunds will be paid back onto your Next account. No interest will be paid on the amount to be refunded. Refunds cannot be issued once a date has been booked with the provider. We ask you to photocopy your Voucher before sending it into us or to send it via registered post, as your Voucher is a valuable document.

### Personalised Item Refunds

Your rights to return the goods to us will not apply in the following circumstances:

Any products that we have made as personalised, or customised specifically for you.

If you discover a defect after this time, please contact us on 0333 777 8000 or email us: customer\_team@next.co.uk

By the very individual nature of personalised products, they cannot be re-sold, and therefore we cannot accept returns or offer an exchange if you have a change of mind.

### Activity Cheques

Activity Cheques can be redeemed for any activity or gift from our website excluding overseas activities. A difference will be payable if the chosen activity costs more than the face value of your activity cheque.

If your chosen activity is cheaper, we will hold the difference as a credit against another activity. In this case the credit holds the same expiry date as the original activity cheque.

### Age, Size and Health Restrictions

For safety reasons, some activities have certain size, age and health restrictions. You are required to notify the activity provider of any relevant medical condition.

We also reserve the right to make minor changes to your activity. Examples of minor changes include car specification, or order of activities on a particular day.

### If You Need To Cancel or Change Your Activity Booking

You should contact us immediately if you need to change or cancel your booking. We will do our best to fill the allocated space, but if we are unable to do so, you may lose your booking. You will be advised by Next Experiences if you can rebook through the cancellation cover.

 Recycling

We take our role as a responsible retailer very seriously, that is why we are supporting the WEEE (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment) Directive from the government and doing our bit to help care for the environment.

### What is the WEEE Directive?

The Directive states that as a retailer we are responsible for increasing the amount of WEEE that is recycled in the UK by assisting in the development of dedicated WEEE collection facilities.

The Directive came into effect on 1st July 2007.

### What are we doing?

We have contributed to a national fund which will help to develop specific WEEE collection centres to ensure that more WEEE gets recycled.

We offer a collection service on a like for like basis, for example if you buy a microwave we can take away your old one. All the appliances we collect are then sent to be recycled.

### What do you have to do?

If you require this service then we ask that you request this at the point of ordering.

Please ensure that the appliance is disconnected from all electricity, gas or water supply before it is collected. In addition to this please ensure that any refrigeration products are emptied of all food and fully de-frosted prior to collection.

### National Support

The national fund we have contributed to will help local councils develop their WEEE collection facilities further, so you can still recycle your appliances even if you do not opt for our service.

Not all council sites are able to collect all types of WEEE, to find your nearest participating site and for advice on all aspects of recycling at home visit: recycle-more.co.uk

Products which are covered by the WEEE Regulations have a crossed out wheelie bin symbol on either the product itself or its packaging.
