Privacy & Cookie Policy
=======================

Last Updated **September 2024**  

 Introduction

Choosing to shop with us means you've placed trust in us to handle your personal data responsibly. In sharing your personal data we hope you in return benefit from a tailored and convenient shopping experience. With trust comes responsibility and we take this responsibility very seriously.

This privacy policy helps you to understand how we use your personal data and who we share it with. It applies if you shop on our websites, use our apps, shop in our stores or if you otherwise share your personal data with us; for example if you contact us with a query or where you tell us that you would like to receive marketing communications from us.

We change the terms of this privacy policy from time to time and you should check it regularly. The last updated date is shown at the beginning of the document. If we make any material changes we will take steps to bring it to your attention.

 Who we are

When we say “we”, “our” or “us” in this policy we are referring to the companies that make up the NEXT Group. This privacy policy applies to the following companies:

Next Retail Limited, Next Holdings Limited, Next Distribution Limited, Next Manufacturing Limited, Next Sourcing Limited, Next Retail Ireland Limited, Next Germany GmbH, Next General Trading LLC, Next General Trading FZE, Next Beauty Limited, Lipsy Limited, Victoria’s Secret (VS Brands Holdings UK Limited), GAP (West Apparel UK Holdings Limited), Reiss (Pink Topco Limited), JoJo Maman Bébé (Regent BidCo 1 Limited) , Joules (The Harborough Hare Limited) and Fatface (Bridgetown Holdco Limited).

The company named within the T&Cs on the website or app is the data controller of your personal data, which means we are responsible for deciding how and why your personal data is used. We are also responsible for making sure it is kept safe, secure and handled legally.

We sometimes work with other organisations in connection with some of the processing activities described in this privacy policy, such as social media platforms. Where that data is collected and sent to other organisations for processing that is for a common purpose, we will be making decisions together in relation to that particular processing and will be ‘joint data controllers’ with the organisations involved. As joint data controllers, we and the other organisations involved in making these decisions will be jointly responsible to you under data protection laws for this processing.

We operate to the highest standards when protecting your personal data and respecting your privacy. If you have any questions about your personal data, or how we use it, you can contact our Data Protection Officer via email at [dataprotection@next.co.uk](https://forms.dataprotection.ie/contact) or by writing to our registered office at the following addresses:

**UK registered address:** Data Protection Officer, NEXT Group, Desford Road, Enderby, Leicester, LE19 4AT.

* **Right of access –**You have the right to request a copy of the personal data that we hold about you.
* **Right to rectification –**If you think any of your personal data that we hold is inaccurate, you have the right to request it is updated. We may ask you for evidence to show it is inaccurate.
* **Right to erasure–** (also known as the right to be forgotten) - You have the right to request that we delete your personal data that we hold..
* **Right to restriction of processing–**You have the right to request we restrict or suppress the personal data we hold about you.

* **Right to withdraw Consent –** Where we are relying on your consent for processing you can withdraw or change your consent at any time.

The above rights may be limited in some circumstances, for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal personal data about another person, if you ask us to delete data which we are required to have by law, or if we have compelling legitimate interests to keep it. We will let you know if that is the case and will then only use your data for these purposes. You may also be unable to continue using our services if you want us to stop processing your personal data.

If you have any general questions or want to exercise any of your rights, please see the **“how you can get in touch”** section of this privacy policy. In order to maintain the security of our customers' personal details, we may need to request proof of identity before we disclose personal data to you in response to any request.

These organisations will report to us on industry fraud indicators and if they have reason to believe an identity is fraudulent. If we have reason to suspect fraud or other criminal offences we will pass your personal data to fraud prevention agencies or law enforcement agencies for the detection, investigation and prevention of crime. If we think there is a risk of fraud, we may suspend activity on your account or refuse access to your account and/or cancel an order. If we do this we will inform you by email or SMS and ask you to contact us.
* **Claims management companies** – where we have received appropriate instruction we will share your data with them if it is requested in order to manage your claim.
* **Debt collection agencies (DCAs)** – If you default on repayments to your credit account we may share your data with DCAs to allow them to collect the outstanding debts from you.

The identities of the DCAs, and the ways in which they use and share personal data, are explained in more detail at:

\- [tdxgroup.com/privacy](https://www.tdxgroup.com/privacy)

* **Debt purchase companies** – Where appropriate will share certain data on defaulted accounts with prospective debt purchasers as part of the negotiations for sale of the debt.
* **Debt management companies** – where we have received appropriate instruction we will share data about your credit account with debt management companies to allow them to assist you with managing your debts.
* **Research and analytics companies** – We may share personal details to allow research companies and feedback providers to contact you directly on our behalf in order to capture your opinions on our products, services, websites and apps. We may ask these research companies to analyse the results so that we can better understand your online experience, which will help us to improve our services. We only provide them with the data they need to perform their function. This may take the form of a survey, where you may be asked to review a product or service you’ve bought or provide general feedback on our products and services. You will always have the choice about whether to take part in our market research or surveys. We may share data with specialist companies to analyse customer data to help us better understand how you use our services and to tailor products, services and offers that may be relevant for you. We utilise companies that help us track and record the way you navigate our website, so that we can understand your online experience and use it to improve our services and offer a more personalised experience.
* **Product technicians** – We use professional third party companies to assist us in independently reviewing issues and complaints with our products. We will share data with these technicians to allow them to review the product and return it to you or to review the product in your home.
* **General service companies** – Such as insurance companies, printers and mailing houses that assist us in providing our products and services.
* **Regulators and law enforcement** – We will share data with regulators and other official bodies (including law enforcement) if they make formal requests or pursuant to legal proceedings.

 International Transfers

Our main operations are based in the UK and your personal data is generally processed, stored and used within the UK. In some instances your personal data may be processed outside the UK. For example, we operate a customer contact centre in Pune, India. Operatives in this location will have access to your account data in order to assist you with your query. We also work with suppliers and partners who may make use of Cloud and /or hosted technologies across multiple geographies.

If you place an order with us and you are outside of the UK we will transfer the personal data that we hold on you to the UK to facilitate your order and may also transfer your personal data to third parties located in your country of residence to enable us to supply products you order from us. If and when this is the case we take steps to ensure there is an appropriate level of security so your personal data is protected in the same way as if it was being used within the UK.

Where we need to transfer your personal data outside the UK, and if the recipient country has not been determined as providing an equivalent adequate level of protection as the UK, we will use one of the following safeguards:

* The use of European Commission approved standard contractual clauses in contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries; and/or
* The International Data Transfer Agreement or Addendum for the transfer of personal data to third countries.

 Keeping your personal data secure

We always ensure that personal data is secure by continuously developing our security systems and training for our employees. We have implemented appropriate technical and organisational security measures designed to protect your personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure, unauthorised access, and other unlawful or unauthorised forms of processing, in accordance with applicable law.

 Third party apps, websites and services

If you use any third party apps, websites or services to access our services, your usage is subject to the relevant third party's terms and conditions, cookies policy, and privacy policy. For example, if you interact with us on social media, your use is subject to the terms and conditions and privacy policies of the relevant social media platform (Facebook, X etc.). The same applies if you use third party services, like Amazon's Alexa. In certain cases we may be required to share your personal data, in relation to transactions and usage of the services, with the relevant third party.
