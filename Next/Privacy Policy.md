Privacy & Cookie Policy
=======================

Last Updated **September 2024**  

 Introduction

Choosing to shop with us means you've placed trust in us to handle your personal data responsibly. In sharing your personal data we hope you in return benefit from a tailored and convenient shopping experience. With trust comes responsibility and we take this responsibility very seriously.

This privacy policy helps you to understand how we use your personal data and who we share it with. It applies if you shop on our websites, use our apps, shop in our stores or if you otherwise share your personal data with us; for example if you contact us with a query or where you tell us that you would like to receive marketing communications from us.

We change the terms of this privacy policy from time to time and you should check it regularly. The last updated date is shown at the beginning of the document. If we make any material changes we will take steps to bring it to your attention.

 Who we are

When we say “we”, “our” or “us” in this policy we are referring to the companies that make up the NEXT Group. This privacy policy applies to the following companies:

Next Retail Limited, Next Holdings Limited, Next Distribution Limited, Next Manufacturing Limited, Next Sourcing Limited, Next Retail Ireland Limited, Next Germany GmbH, Next General Trading LLC, Next General Trading FZE, Next Beauty Limited, Lipsy Limited, Victoria’s Secret (VS Brands Holdings UK Limited), GAP (West Apparel UK Holdings Limited), Reiss (Pink Topco Limited), JoJo Maman Bébé (Regent BidCo 1 Limited) , Joules (The Harborough Hare Limited) and Fatface (Bridgetown Holdco Limited).

The company named within the T&Cs on the website or app is the data controller of your personal data, which means we are responsible for deciding how and why your personal data is used. We are also responsible for making sure it is kept safe, secure and handled legally.

We sometimes work with other organisations in connection with some of the processing activities described in this privacy policy, such as social media platforms. Where that data is collected and sent to other organisations for processing that is for a common purpose, we will be making decisions together in relation to that particular processing and will be ‘joint data controllers’ with the organisations involved. As joint data controllers, we and the other organisations involved in making these decisions will be jointly responsible to you under data protection laws for this processing.

We operate to the highest standards when protecting your personal data and respecting your privacy. If you have any questions about your personal data, or how we use it, you can contact our Data Protection Officer via email at [dataprotection@next.co.uk](https://forms.dataprotection.ie/contact) or by writing to our registered office at the following addresses:

**UK registered address:** Data Protection Officer, NEXT Group, Desford Road, Enderby, Leicester, LE19 4AT.

**EU registered address:** Data Protection Officer, NEXT Retail (Ireland) Ltd, 13–18 City Quay, Dublin 2, D02 ED70, Ireland.

 Your rights

You can read more about these rights on the UK Information Commissioner's Office website at [ico.org.uk/for-the-public](https://ico.org.uk/for-the-public/), or on your local [Data Protection Authority](https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/about-edpb/members_en) website.

* **Right of access –**You have the right to request a copy of the personal data that we hold about you.
* **Right to rectification –**If you think any of your personal data that we hold is inaccurate, you have the right to request it is updated. We may ask you for evidence to show it is inaccurate.
* **Right to erasure–** (also known as the right to be forgotten) - You have the right to request that we delete your personal data that we hold..
* **Right to restriction of processing–**You have the right to request we restrict or suppress the personal data we hold about you.
* **Right to data portability –**You have the right to ask us to electronically transfer your personal data to another organisation in certain circumstances.
* **Rights with regards to automated decision making, including profiling –** You have the right not to be subject to a decision that is based solely on automated processing if the decision affects your legal rights or other equally important matters and to object to profiling in certain situations, including for direct marketing.
* **Right to withdraw Consent –** Where we are relying on your consent for processing you can withdraw or change your consent at any time.

The above rights may be limited in some circumstances, for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal personal data about another person, if you ask us to delete data which we are required to have by law, or if we have compelling legitimate interests to keep it. We will let you know if that is the case and will then only use your data for these purposes. You may also be unable to continue using our services if you want us to stop processing your personal data.

If you have any general questions or want to exercise any of your rights, please see the **“how you can get in touch”** section of this privacy policy. In order to maintain the security of our customers' personal details, we may need to request proof of identity before we disclose personal data to you in response to any request.

The Data Protection Authority in the UK, where we are based, is the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), you can contact the ICO here: [ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint](https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/). Our main supervisory authority in the EU is the Data Protection Commission (DPC) based in the Republic of Ireland, you can contact the DPC here: [forms.dataprotection.ie/contact](https://forms.dataprotection.ie/contact)

 International Transfers

Our main operations are based in the UK and your personal data is generally processed, stored and used within the UK. In some instances your personal data may be processed outside the UK. For example, we operate a customer contact centre in Pune, India. Operatives in this location will have access to your account data in order to assist you with your query. We also work with suppliers and partners who may make use of Cloud and /or hosted technologies across multiple geographies.

If you place an order with us and you are outside of the UK we will transfer the personal data that we hold on you to the UK to facilitate your order and may also transfer your personal data to third parties located in your country of residence to enable us to supply products you order from us. If and when this is the case we take steps to ensure there is an appropriate level of security so your personal data is protected in the same way as if it was being used within the UK.

Where we need to transfer your personal data outside the UK, and if the recipient country has not been determined as providing an equivalent adequate level of protection as the UK, we will use one of the following safeguards:

* The use of European Commission approved standard contractual clauses in contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries; and/or
* The International Data Transfer Agreement or Addendum for the transfer of personal data to third countries.

 Keeping your personal data secure

We always ensure that personal data is secure by continuously developing our security systems and training for our employees. We have implemented appropriate technical and organisational security measures designed to protect your personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure, unauthorised access, and other unlawful or unauthorised forms of processing, in accordance with applicable law.
