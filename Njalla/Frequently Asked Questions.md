We're extremely normal.
-----------------------

Everyone says they're different and how cool they are. Startups talk about how they want to disrupt an industry. We just want a decent society; like most people. We build the services that are lacking. The most interesting people that use our services are the ones that make us have to go to court to protect them. Or get DDoS attacked. We're not gonna win the entrepreneurship awards or get a big loan with that business plan, but we're here to make life good and to make privacy extremely normalised.

Domains
-------

We don't do annoying package pricing. We include all features in all registrations - from the domain privacy and anycasted DNS to support and email forwarding.

#### Basics

Pricing starts at €15 per year depending on the top level domain. We support most and add more all the time.

#### Privacy

We’re famously the most trusted privacy provider in the world, with a track record to prove it.

VPN
---

Njalla provides you with an encrypted tunnel from your computer to the Internet. We hide your real IP address behind one of ours. This means your online activity can’t instantly be seen by service providers, governments or others. We use Wireguard and OpenVPN.

#### Experience

We’ve done this for 15+ years, with a track record like no other.

#### For everyone

If you’re an activist, a soccer mom or just hiding your obsession with cross-stitching we’re used to dealing with weird situations.

Server
------

Need a place to put up your own mastodon, matrix, nextcloud or protest blog? We needed it ourselves, so we built it.

#### Basics

We support many Linux distributions for our virtual machines, and if you need a physical server, contact us!

#### Storage

We use a distributed storage backend - so your data is stored in a redundant way across multiple machines.
