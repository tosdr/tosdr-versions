The information on this Website, together with information filed and furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and any oral information provided by IPG executives that relate to IPG’s future performance or financial results are considered forward-looking statements.

7\. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
----------------------------------------

If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then the invalid or unenforceable provision shall be replaced by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision, and the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions shall not be affected.

-------------

The failure of IPG and its affiliates to enforce any part of these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such term or provision and shall not be considered a waiver or limit IPG’s right thereafter to insist upon strict adherence to that term or any other provision of these Terms of Use.
