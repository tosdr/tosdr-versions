National IV Fluid Shortage

Like many other health systems in the U.S., Swedish has been impacted by the national IV fluid shortage. We're taking a variety of measures to conserve supply, including using alternative fluids and solutions as clinically appropriate and indicated. All patients will still receive the highest quality standards of care during this emergency. Patients with an urgent medical need should not delay care.

Terms of Use

Please note that these Terms of Use and linked policies only apply to the Providence Web sites. Providence provides links to third-party websites that are not operated by Providence. Providence users who link to a third-party Web site must recognize that our Terms of Use and other policies do not extend beyond the borders of the Providence Web sites. Other standards and policies may apply outside our Web site. We encourage you to read the terms of use, privacy policies and other policies which apply to these third-party websites before using them.

### 3\. User responsibilities

Providence Web sites are intended to help you be a better-informed health care services user and get access to Providence information and services easily, but we need your help to make it work well. You acknowledge that you must be 13 years or older to provide personal information to Providence through the Providence Web sites and to use certain tools on the Providence Web sites (such as the Grace virtual assistant), and you represent that you are 13 years or older if you do so. We also need you to be responsible for doing your part to protect your personal information, and to understand that the educational information, tools and materials made available through the Providence Web sites are not and do not include medical advice, and are not designed or intended to address your personal health condition or issues.

Users therefore must be responsible for the following:

3.1. Be an Informed User  
Please read these Terms of Use carefully. We need your help in making the Providence Web sites safe and effective tools, and protect them against misuse. Your violation of these Terms of Use is grounds for suspension or termination of your account.

3.2. Maintain and Protect Your Own Equipment  
Providence Web sites are intended to be accessible and all content available through all standard commercial web browsers operating on standard personal computers, through standard commercially-available Internet access. The quality of content presentation and download speeds may vary depending on the software, equipment and Internet connections used.

You may be able to use devices other than a personal computer to access the Providence Web sites, such as some personal digital assistants, cell phones or other devices. If you do choose to use another kind of device to access the Providence Web sites, you must be responsible for protecting it in accordance with these Terms of Use. Any requirement for personal computer protection in these Terms of Use applies equally to any other device you may use to access the Providence Web sites.

* Providence does not provide any software, equipment or Internet connections. You are solely responsible for providing all software, computer equipment and other hardware, and Internet connections necessary to access the Providence Web sites.
* Some features on the Providence Web sites, such as the Career Advancement Center and Health & Fitness class registration, allow you to create an online account. Your personal computer may store and automatically upload your user name and password for account access. You may also download information from the Providence Web sites to your personal computer or other devices. If someone else uses your personal computer or other devices, they may be able to use these functions to gain access to your account or personal information. Providence cannot prevent or be responsible for protecting your personal computer or other devices against unauthorized use. You are solely responsible for protecting the personal computers or other devices you use against unauthorized use to access your account.
* If you use a personal computer or other device provided by or shared with your employer, parent, spouse, roommate or other person, that other party may have the legal right to view all information stored on it. Providence cannot prevent or be responsible for such activities. If you use a personal computer or other device that another person has the legal right to control, you access your Providence account at your own risk.
* Whenever you are done using the Providence Web sites you should log off the Web site, and you should not leave your computer or other device unattended when it is logged on to the Providence Web sites and someone else may be able to view the screen or use the computer or other device. If you leave a Providence Web site session logged-in when someone else can see your computer screen or use your personal computer or other device they may be able to gain access to your account or personal information. Providence cannot log you off your personal computer or protect your personal computer against unauthorized access. You are solely responsible for protecting the personal computers or other devices you use against unauthorized use to access your account.
* Computer viruses, worms, spyware and other malicious software on your computer can be used to gather passwords and personal information from that computer, often without the user’s knowledge. Providence cannot prevent or be responsible for detecting or removing malicious software on computers you use to access the Providence Web sites. Affordable antivirus and antispyware software is readily available for personal computers. You should maintain and regularly use current antivirus and antispyware software on any personal computer you use to access the Providence Web sites.
* Unauthorized individuals (“hackers”) and malicious software can sometimes gain access to computers through Internet connections, unless the computer has a working firewall. Unauthorized access of this kind may not be easily detected and may allow passwords and personal information to be gathered without the computer user’s knowledge. Providence does not provide and cannot be responsible for implementing a firewall for your computer. Firewall software is standard on many personal computers and affordable firewall software for personal computers is readily available. You should maintain a working firewall on any computer you use to access Providence Web sites.
* Computer criminals may sometimes send e-mails that appear to come from legitimate organizations. These e-mails typically ask you to log on to a Web site using a link in the e-mail, and enter some personal information to “verify,” “correct” or “update” your account, or something similar. This practice is known as “phishing,” and is intended to get personal information from unwary users to use for identity theft and other fraud.

IN ORDER TO HELP AVOID THE THREAT OF PHISHING, PROVIDENCE WILL NEVER SEND YOU UNSOLICITED E-MAILS THAT INCLUDE A LINK TO A PROVIDENCE WEB SITE WHERE YOU WILL BE ASKED TO PROVIDE PERSONAL INFORMATION. IF YOU RECEIVE AN E-MAIL THAT CLAIMS TO BE FROM PROVIDENCE WHICH INCLUDES A LINK TO A WEB SITE WHICH APPEARS TO BE OPERATED BY PROVIDENCE, OR BY ANY PARTY ON BEHALF OF PROVIDENCE, AND WHICH ASKS YOU TO PROVIDE PERSONAL INFORMATION, PLEASE DO NOT PROVIDE THAT PERSONAL INFORMATION.

If you receive any suspicious e-mail which claims or appears to be from Providence, please notify us by calling the Providence Integrity Line at 1-888-294-8455.

3.3. Protect Your Password  
Access to your account and to personal information about you is password-protected. If your password is easy to guess, or if you share your password or someone else sees or steals it, someone else may be able to get access to your account. Please use a strong password, and protect it from other people.

Providence relies upon your password in allowing access to your account and cannot prevent unauthorized access if your password is compromised. You are responsible for all activity taking place under your password unless we have been notified that it is compromised. Please notify us at once if you believe your password has been compromised, and we will help you change it. You can contact us about possible password compromise at the Providence Integrity Line, 1-888-294-8455.

3.4. Do Not Provide Third Party Services  
You are not permitted to use the Providence Web sites to provide or support informational, educational, messaging or other services to other parties. The information and services made available by and through the Providence Web sites are for personal use only.

4.4. Linked Websites Are Not Endorsed

### 2\. Providence/Swedish mobile app

#### Your Personal Information

##### The Limited Ways We Use Your Information

We do not sell or license your information. These are the limited ways we interact with your information in connection with our mobile apps:

* Our mobile app lets users who are Providence patients access the information stored in their electronic health record (EHR) managed by Epic’s software, including medications, test results, and visit summaries. The app also lets patients send messages, schedule appointments, and check-in online.
* When you choose to add a profile photo to our mobile apps, you may select an existing photo on your device or take a new photo using the camera app on your device. If you select an existing photo on your device, we store a copy of your chosen photo in app-private storage on your device. If you use the camera app on your device to take a new photo, the photo you take is first saved to your camera app and then also saved to app-private storage on your device. If you remove the photo from your profile or delete our mobile apps, the copy of the photo is deleted from the app-private storage, but the photo saved to your camera app remains available in your camera app until you choose to delete it.
* When you choose to view documents (such as letters or images) using our mobile app, to make the files viewable for you we temporarily store copies on your device in app-private storage. The temporary copies are deleted when you close your session on our mobile apps.
* If you choose automatic appointment arrival and you choose to enable it, we temporarily store identifiers and times for your upcoming appointments in app-private storage to detect when you arrive for an upcoming appointment. If you choose to stop using our mobile app or disable automatic appointment arrival, the identifiers are deleted.
* If you choose location-based check in for in-person appointments, or to find health care providers near you, you may choose to allow our mobile app to interact with your location data for those purposes.
* If you choose to notify front desk staff electronically when you arrive for an appointment, you may choose to allow our mobile app to interact with your Bluetooth data for this purpose.
* Our mobile app will ask for access to File, Photos and Media to allow users who are Providence patients to upload or download documents and message attachments in correspondence with the patient’s health care team. Providence stores uploaded documents in your electronic medical record.
* Our mobile app will ask for access to camera and microphone to allow users who are Providence patients to access video-based virtual care with their health care provider. No audio or video is recorded during these visits.
* Our mobile app uses phone number to send patients an SMS to confirm your phone number.
* Our mobile app will ask for access to wi-fi and cellular data connection to monitor the connection status during a virtual care visit and to better optimize your experience with your provider.
* We have an option to delete the user account within the app as requested by Apple Store Guideline 5.1.1. As a result of account deletion via our mobile app, your medical record will not be deleted by Providence and will remain available through Epic EHR. Users who are patients can always re-create a new account within our mobile app to re-obtain access to your medical records.
* While you use our app, we collect non-identifying information so we can provide customer service to you to understand how people use our mobile app so we can improve our products. This information includes the time you began using the app, any error messages or codes, the model of device used and its operating system, and the version of our mobile app used. If you use Android devices, we also collect your connection type (cellular or Wi-Fi) during an error.
* While using our app, Providence identifies and tracks each user by device and assigns the device a unique code/device name. Providence may send a notification, while using this app, to the user using this unique device name/code. You may opt-out of notifications by turning off these notifications in the app.
* If you contact us, we may keep a record of the communication. You can decide how much information you want to share with us in those cases.
* The Epic EHR software within the Providence apps use HealthKit. Upload health and fitness data, including data from the “Apple Health app,” when enrolled in self-tracking programs.

For Android Users – Required Google Play Disclosures for Certain Health Apps

Google has determined our mobile app is subject to their COVID-19 apps requirements. As a result, we are required to provide the following information so we can make our mobile app available to you in the Play store.

* Our mobile app interacts with your microphone if you choose to use your microphone to navigate our mobile apps. Our mobile app interacts with your camera roll if you choose to add a profile photo to a profile in our mobile apps. This information is not used in connection with COVID-19.
* Our mobile app accesses, collects, uses, and shares your information as stated above in the section titled, “The Limited Ways We Use Your Information.”
* Our mobile app was not created specifically for the COVID-19 pandemic. It existed before the COVID-19 pandemic to allow you to access your health information on file with your health care organization. We may allow you to access COVID-19-related vaccination information, laboratory test results, and documents with illness-related information using our mobile apps. You may choose if or how you want to access, display, or use the information – just like you can make those decisions about health information relating to other conditions, services, tests or vaccinations.

### 3\. Use and disclosure of personal information

Providence collects and uses personal information subject to this Privacy Policy as follows:

* Providence will not intentionally collect any personal information subject to this Privacy Policy about any person under the age of 13.
