28. **Binding Arbitration Agreement and Class Action Waiver.**
    
    **PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY - IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY HEAR YOUR CLAIMS. IT CONTAINS PROCEDURES FOR MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.**
    
    **Scope of the Arbitration Agreement. You and we each agree that, except as provided below, any dispute, claim, or controversy relating in any way to or arising in any way out of the Terms, the Provider’s services, or the Provider’s products, including the Service, and any use (or lack of use) or access (or lack of access) thereto, or purchase from the Provider (collectively, “Dispute”)—irrespective of when that Dispute arose—whether based in contract, warranty, tort, statute, regulation, ordinance, or any other legal or equitable basis, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding individual arbitration, rather than in Court. You and we thereby agree to waive any right to a jury trial, and agree that you and we may bring claims against each other only in an individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. “Dispute” will be given the broadest possible meaning allowable under law.**
    
    * Informal Dispute-Resolution Process. Either party asserting a Dispute shall first try in good faith to resolve it by providing written notice to the other party, as specified below, describing the facts and circumstances relating to the Dispute (including any relevant documentation). You must send any notice to legal@bold.com or to the U.S. mailing address listed in the “Contact Us” section of these Terms. Any notice we send to you will be sent to the most recent contact information that you provide us. If no such information exists or if such information is not current, we have no obligation under this section. For a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, you and the Provider will attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute, though nothing will require either you or the Provider to resolve the Dispute on terms that either you or the Provider, in each of our sole discretion, find unacceptable. Both you and the Provider agree that this Informal Dispute-Resolution Process is a condition precedent which must be satisfied before the initiation of arbitration against the other party.
        
    * Arbitrating Disputes. After the Informal Dispute-Resolution Process, any remaining Dispute will be resolved through binding arbitration, using the English language, administered by JAMS under its Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “JAMS Rules”) then in effect (those rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this section, and as of the date of these Terms). If arbitration before JAMS is unavailable or impossible for any valid reason, any Dispute remaining after the Informal Dispute-Resolution Process will be conducted by, and according to, the rules and regulations then in effect of the American Arbitration Association (AAA). Either Party may initiate arbitration of a Dispute upon completion of the Informal Dispute-Resolution Process for that Dispute. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any and all Disputes arising out of or relating to the formation, existence, scope, validity, interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this agreement to arbitrate, or any part of it, or of these Terms of Use, including, but not limited to, any claim (except as explicitly outlined below) that all or any part of this agreement to arbitrate or the Terms of Use is void or voidable. If any party disagrees about whether any portion of this Section 28 can be enforced or whether it applies to the Dispute, the parties agree that the arbitrator will decide that Dispute. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that any issue concerning the validity of the class action waiver contained in this arbitration agreement must be decided by a court, and an arbitrator does not have authority to consider the validity of the class action waiver. Both you and the Provider understand and agree that we are waiving our right to sue or go to court to assert or defend our rights, except as set forth below.
        
        Unless you and the Provider agree otherwise, including to conduct the arbitration by telephone or videoconference or to have the arbitrator decide the Dispute without a hearing, any arbitration brought by or against a User who lives in the United States shall take place in-person in the User’s hometown or in New York, NY, unless the arbitrator determines that a different location would better serve the convenience of the parties. If you live outside the United States, any arbitration will take place in New York, NY.
        
        **Arbitration will be handled by a single arbitrator in accordance with the JAMS Rules. Judgement on the arbitration award may be entered in any court that has jurisdiction. Any arbitration under these Terms will take place on an individual basis – class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. You understand that by agreeing to these Terms, you and the Provider are each waiving the right to trial by jury or to participate in a class action or class arbitration.**
        
    * Exceptions. Notwithstanding the arbitration agreement in this Section 28, you and the Provider agree that the following types of Disputes will be resolved in a court of proper jurisdiction, unless both you and the Provider agree to submit the Dispute to arbitration pursuant to the procedures in this binding arbitration agreement:
        
        * Disputes or claims within the jurisdiction of a small claims court consistent with the jurisdictional and dollar limits that may apply, as long as the action or proceeding is brought and maintained as an individual action or proceeding and not as a class, representative, or consolidated action or proceeding;
            
        * Disputes or claims where the sole form of relief sought is injunctive relief (including public injunctive relief); or
            
        * intellectual property Disputes.
            
        
        Any litigation in court of the foregoing types of Disputes (except for small claims court actions) may be commenced only in a federal or state court located within New York, NY, and you and the Provider each consent to the jurisdiction of those courts for such purposes. Regardless of whether the foregoing types of Disputes in this Exceptions provision are resolved by a court or pursuant to arbitration, you and the Provider agree that the Dispute is subject to the class action waiver provision set in this Section 28.
        
    * Costs of Arbitration. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator costs and expenses will be governed by the JAMS Rules, except that if you demonstrate that any such costs and expenses owed by you under those rules would be prohibitively more expensive than a court proceeding, the Provider will pay the amount of any such costs and expenses that the arbitrator determines are necessary to prevent the arbitration from being prohibitively more expensive than a court proceeding (subject to possible reimbursement as set forth below).
        
        Each party is responsible for his, her, their or its own attorneys’ fees and expenses, and the Provider will not pay your attorneys’ fees or expenses except to the extent ordered by the arbitrator. For the avoidance of doubt, in cases where a statute gives you the right to recover attorneys’ fees if you prevail, the arbitrator may award attorneys’ fees pursuant to that statute. In the event the arbitrator determines the Dispute you brought to arbitration is, in whole or in part, frivolous according to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, or brought for an improper purpose, you agree to reimburse the Provider for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by the Provider that you otherwise would have been obligated to pay under the JAMS Rules. In determining whether a Dispute is frivolous, in whole or in part, the arbitrator may consider whether the Provider has offered you a full refund of the sum you paid to the Provider for services provided by the Provider or has otherwise offered full relief to you in relation to your individual claim. If the arbitrator, upon final disposition of the case, finds your Dispute was not frivolous, the Provider will reimburse any filing fees that you paid and were not otherwise reimbursed. Judgement on the arbitration award may be entered in any court that has jurisdiction.
        
    * **
        
        Opt-Out. You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration provisions set forth in these Terms by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to:
        
        BOLD LLC
        
        City View Plaza II, Suite 6000
        
        Guaynabo, PR 00968
        
        United States of America
        
        The notice must be sent to the Provider within thirty (30) days of your first agreeing to these Terms; otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes on a non-class basis in accordance with these Terms. If you opt out of only the arbitration provisions, and not also the class action waiver provision, the class action waiver still applies. You may not opt out of only the class action waiver provision and not also the arbitration provisions. If you opt-out of the arbitration provisions, or if you opt out of both the arbitration and the class action waiver provisions, the Provider will also not be bound by them.
        
        **
    * **WAIVER OF RIGHT TO BRING CLASS ACTION AND REPRESENTATIVE CLAIMS.** To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you and the Provider each agree that any proceeding, whether in court or arbitration, to resolve any Dispute will be brought and conducted ONLY IN THE RESPECTIVE PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS PART OF ANY CLASS (OR PURPORTED CLASS), CONSOLIDATED, MULTIPLE-PLAINTIFF, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING (“CLASS ACTION”). You and the Provider AGREE TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS ACTION. You and the Provider EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY ABILITY TO MAINTAIN A CLASS ACTION IN ANY FORUM (whether arbitration, court, or otherwise). If the dispute is subject to arbitration, THE ARBITRATOR WILL NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO COMBINE OR AGGREGATE CLAIMS, CONDUCT A CLASS ACTION, OR MAKE AN AWARD TO ANY PERSON OR ENTITY NOT A PARTY TO THE ARBITRATION. Further, you and the Provider agree that the ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE PROCEEDINGS FOR MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, AND THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CLASS ACTION. For the avoidance of doubt, the waiver of the right to bring claims in or otherwise participate in a class, representative, or consolidated action or proceeding set forth in the class action waiver contained herein does not prevent you from seeking public injunctive relief in an individual capacity to the extent otherwise authorized by law.
        
        IF THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER IS LIMITED, VOIDED, OR FOUND UNENFORCEABLE, THEN, UNLESS THE PARTIES MUTUALLY AGREE OTHERWISE, THE PARTIES’ AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE SHALL BE NULL AND VOID WITH RESPECT TO SUCH PROCEEDING SO LONG AS THE PROCEEDING IS PERMITTED TO PROCEED AS A CLASS ACTION. If a court decides that the limitations of this Section 28(f) are deemed invalid or unenforceable, any putative class, private attorney general, or consolidated or representative action must be brought in a court of proper jurisdiction and not in arbitration.
        
    * **Miscellaneous.** We will provide notice of any material changes to this binding Arbitration Agreement and/or class action waiver (which may be satisfied by updating these Terms of Use, unless not otherwise permitted by law), in which case you will have the right to opt out of the arbitration provisions and/or class action waiver within 30 days after such change, consistent with the terms above. Except as set forth above regarding the class action waiver provision, if any portion of these arbitration provisions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it will not invalidate the remaining portions of these arbitration provisions. Other than with respect to the class action waiver, as set forth above, only the arbitrator is authorized to make determinations as to the scope, validity, or enforceability of this binding Arbitration Agreement, including whether any Dispute falls within its scope.
        
        In the event that the arbitration agreement and/or class action waiver in this Section 28 is for any reason held to be unenforceable, any litigation against us (except for actions in small claims court) may be commenced only in a federal or state court located in New York, NY, and you and the Provider each consent to the jurisdiction of those courts for such purposes. In the event any provision of these Terms of Use is found by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void, or unenforceable, you agree that, unless it materially affects the entire intent and purpose of these Terms of Use, the invalidity, voidness, or unenforceability shall affect neither the validity of these Terms of Use nor the remaining provisions herein (except as set forth above with respect to the class action waiver), and the provision in question shall be deemed to be replaced with a valid and enforceable provision most closely reflecting the intent and purpose of the original provision.
        
    * Non-US or EU Residents: If any controversy, allegation or claim (including any non-contractual claim) arises out of or relates to the Site or these Terms, then you and we agree to send a written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of this dispute, along with a proposed resolution of it. Our notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you provide us. If no such information exists or if such information is not current, then, we have no obligation under this section. Your notice must be sent to us at legal@flexjobs.com. For a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, FlexJobs and you will engage in a dialogue in order to attempt to resolve the dispute, although nothing will require either you or FlexJobs to resolve the dispute on terms either you or FlexJobs, in each of our sole discretion, are uncomfortable. Nothing in this Section will prevent a party from pursuing their claims in Court or another complaint process.
        
    * European Union Residents: You may have a right to an out-of-court settlement of certain disputes in accordance with Regulation (EU) No. 524/2013. Details can be found in Regulation (EU) No. 524/2013 and at: **http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr**. We are neither obliged nor willing to participate in an out-of-court dispute resolution procedure before a consumer arbitration board. Your statutory rights regarding choice of law and venue, to the extent applicable, remain unaffected.

FlexJobs uses your personal information to perform the contract and provide our Services.

You have the right to exercise this right personally or through an authorized agent, who will have to provide the necessary evidence to confirm his/her agent status.
