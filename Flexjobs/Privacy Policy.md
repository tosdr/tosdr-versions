You may be able to decline tracking technologies if your browser permits, although doing so can interfere with your use of the Site. Refer to the help section of your browser, browser extensions, or installed applications for instructions on blocking, deleting, or disabling tracking technologies such as cookies.

    * **right of data portability;**  
        You have the right to receive the Personal Data given to us through the Site in a commonly used and machine-readable format – if it was collected in an automated way, and the legal basis of processing was your consent or a contract (for example, if you accepted our terms of service). You may also request us to transfer your Information to another provider or controller of data, where technically feasible.
        
    * **right to withdraw consent;**  
        When you have provided consent to the processing, you may withdraw it at any time.

    * **right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing**  
        You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affects you. This will not apply if the decision: (a) is necessary for entering into, or performance of, a contract between you and us; (b) is authorized by Union or Member State law to which we are subject and which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard your rights and freedoms and legitimate interests; or is based on your explicit consent.

Please refer to Section 14 for more information about storage and international transfers.

    This section provides specific information and applies only to residents of California (“California consumers” in this section). The California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) requires that we provide certain information to California consumers about how we handle certain Personal Data that we have collected, whether online or offline.

You may request us to stop sharing or selling your personal information and we will honour your request for at least 12 months before asking you to opt back in. You have the right to exercise this right personally or through an authorized agent, who will have to provide the necessary evidence to confirm his/her agent status. Your request will be subject to an identification process, and we will not fulfil your request unless you have provided all the information required.
        
        To make a Do Not Sell or Share my Personal Information request, please submit your request by contacting us at privacy@flexjobs.com and following the instructions.
