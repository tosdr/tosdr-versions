If you do not de-activate or erase the cookie, each time you use the same browser or device to access the Platform, our web servers will be notified of your visit to the Platform and, in turn, we may have knowledge of your visit and the pattern of your usage.

Cookies set by the site or app owner (in this case, AliExpress) are called “**first party Cookies**”. Cookies set by third parties other than the site or app owner are called “**third party Cookies**”. Third party Cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g. like advertising, interactive content and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your device both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.

Session cookies use encrypted data to authenticate you. Persistent Cookies do not store account numbers or passwords. We use both session cookies and persistent cookies.

**Why do we use Cookies?**

We use first- and third-party Cookies for several reasons.

Some Cookies are required for technical and/or security reasons in order for our Platform to operate, and we refer to these as “essential” or “strictly necessary” Cookies. First party Cookies are mainly served to enable basic functionality on our Platform; including web analytics Cookies that help us understand how users use our web pages and how we can improve their use.

We also use social media Cookies. You may register for Platform membership and “share” Platform content through social media such as Facebook and Twitter. Sometimes we embed videos from websites like YouTube. These websites have their own privacy policies which govern their use of information, which you can find on the respective websites.

We also use Cookies to enable us to track and target the interests of Platform visitors to enhance the experience on our Platform by researching visiting patterns and conducting interest-based advertising; assisting our partners in tracking user visits to the Platforms; and to track progress and participation in promotions and the success of our email marketing campaigns. We use first- and third-party Cookies for these purposes.

**Collection of Personal Information**. During the preceding 12 months, we have collected, used, and/or disclosed the categories of personal information described above in section A. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION.

The personal information that we collect, or have collected in the preceding 12 months, falls into the following categories of personal information, as enumerated by the CCPA:

**Disclosure of Personal Information**. We disclose or share personal information in the ways described above in section C. DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL DATA, including by allowing third parties that provide us analytics and advertising services to collect information through cookies and other similar technologies.  

The CCPA defines a "sale" as disclosing or making available personal information to a third party in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration, and "sharing" includes disclosing or making available personal information to a third party for purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising. While we do not disclose personal information to third parties in exchange for monetary compensation, like many websites, we may "share" (as defined in the CCPA) certain identifiers (i.e., IP address and online identifiers), usage data, and inferences to advertising networks, data analytics providers, operating systems and platforms, and social networks, including in the context of our use of certain cookies, pixel tags, and other similar tools and technologies. We do so in order to improve and evaluate our advertising campaigns and better reach customers and prospective customers with more relevant ads and content.

The types of personal information that we may share include unique identifiers (e.g., cookies and similar technologies), device information, geolocation data, commercial data, behavioral data, and inferences.

To the extent that the use of cookies and other tracking technologies to disclose certain personal information to third parties to display targeted or personalized advertisements to you constitutes a "sale" or "sharing" of personal information under the CCPA, you may opt out of such cookies at any time by adjusting your cookie choices in our [Cookie Preferences](https://www.aliexpress.com/p/cookie-setting/index.html) on our Platform to adjust your cookie choices.

We do not "sell" or "share" sensitive personal information, nor do we "sell" or "share" any personal information about individuals who we know are under sixteen (16) years old.

You can opt out of any future sale of personal information by using the contact details provided under section P. HOW TO CONTACT US below.

To the extent that such practice may constitute a "selling" or "sharing" of personal information under the CCPA, you may opt-out of such "selling" or "sharing" at any time by using our [Cookie Preferences](https://www.aliexpress.com/p/cookie-setting/index.html) on our Platform to adjust your cookie choices.

•   **Limit the use and disclosure of sensitive personal information:** We do not use or disclose "sensitive personal information" (as defined by the CCPA) for the purpose of inferring characteristics about you, or in any way that would require a right to limit under the CCPA. As a result, we do not offer an ability to limit the use or disclosure of sensitive personal information.

•   **Non-Discrimination:** You have the right not to be discriminated against because you exercise your rights under the CCPA. We shall not discriminate against you for exercising any of your above rights, for example, we will not charge you different prices or provide different quality of services to you for exercising your CCPA rights unless those differences are related to your information or otherwise permitted by law.

**California Shine the Light Law.** Since 2005, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits our customers who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
