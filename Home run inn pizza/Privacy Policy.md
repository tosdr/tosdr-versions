The categories of information we have collected about you in the last 12 months include the following:

We collect data about the features you use, the emails and advertisements you view, the products you consider and purchase, the date and time you access the Web Sites or Applications, the pages you access while using the Web Sites or Applications, and the internet address of the web sites, if any, from which you linked directly to the Web Sites or Applications, and other similar information. 

* Device Connectivity and Configuration Data. We collect data about the type of device you use, the operating system and browser you use, your internet service provider, your device’s regional and language settings, and other similar information. This data also includes IP address, MAC address, device advertising Id (e.g., IDFA or AAID), and other device identifiers. 

* Location Data. We collect data about your device’s location, which can be precise (e.g., latitude/longitude data) or imprecise (e.g., location derived from an IP address or data that indicates a city or postal code level). 

We use cookies and other tracking technologies now and hereafter developed to automatically collect this information, including the following: 

* Log Files. A log file is a file that records events that occur in connection with your use of the Web Sites and Applications, such as IP address, browser type, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamps, and related data.

A “cookie” is a small piece of data that can be sent by a web server to your device, which then may be stored by your browser on your device’s hard drive. Cookies and browser storage allow us to recognize your device while you are on our Web Sites and Applications and help customize your online experience and support security features. Cookies and browser storage are also useful in allowing more efficient log-in for users, tracking transaction histories and preserving information between sessions.

We only maintain the audio long enough to complete your instruction or request and then immediately delete it. We may use non-audio data associated with the collection for additional purposes such as data analytics and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 

* Device Fingerprinting. Device fingerprinting is the process of analyzing and combining sets of information elements from your device’s browser, such as JavaScript objects and installed fonts, in order to create a “fingerprint” of your device and uniquely identify your device and applications. 

* In-App Tracking Methods. There are a variety of tracking technologies that may be included in mobile applications, and these are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings. Some use device advertising Id or other device identifiers to associate app user activity to a particular app and to track user activity across apps. 

We may incorporate tracking technologies into our emails, Web Sites, or Applications, as well as into our ads. Some of these tracking technologies may track your activities across time and services for purposes of associating the different devices you use, and delivering relevant ads and/or other content to you.

**Analytics, Advertising, And Retargeting** 

Home Run Inn engages other entities for analytics services. These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies to analyze your usage of our Web Sites and Applications. 

In addition, we engage other entities to serve advertisements on the Web Sites and Applications and/or on other services. These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and share information with us about your visits to this and other services in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you, measure and research the effectiveness of our advertisements, track page usage and paths followed during visits through our Web Sites and Applications, help us serve relevant internet banner advertisements on our Web Sites and Applications and on other services, and track use of our internet banner advertisements and other links from our business partners’ services to our Web Sites and Applications. Home Run Inn may use the information collected on its Web Sites and Applications for online behavioral advertising purposes including retargeting and to customize ads to you when you visit other services. 

We also use audience matching services to reach people (or people similar to people) who have visited our Web Sites, Applications, or are identified in one or more of our databases (“Matched Ads”). This is done by us uploading a customer list to a technology service or programmatically by incorporating technologies such as pixels, SDKs, or APIs from a technology service into our own Web Sites or Applications, and the technology service matching common factors between our data and their data. For instance, we incorporate the Facebook pixel on our Web Sites and may share your email address with Facebook as part of our use of Facebook Custom Audiences. 

As indicated above, the entities providing these services may act as our service providers, or in certain contexts, independently decide how to process your information. Information collected by these services may be transmitted to and stored on servers in the U.S. (or elsewhere). We encourage you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use. 

For further information on the types of tracking technologies we use and your rights and choices regarding analytics, interest-based advertising, and Matched Ads, please see the sections entitled “Information Collected Automatically” above and “Your Rights and Choices” below.

Tracking Technologies Generally. Most web browsers (such as Microsoft Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Firefox and Apple Safari) accept cookies by default. You can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to decline or delete cookies. If you use multiple browsers on your device, you will need to instruct each browser separately. Your ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.

For information on how to do this on Apple devices, visit Apple.com or https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074. For information on how to do this on Android devices, visit Google.com. You can stop all collection of information via an app by uninstalling the app. 

The location data collected through an app depends on your device settings and app permissions. You can exercise choice over the location data collected through our apps by (i) for GPS data, disabling location in your device settings or disabling location permissions to that app; (ii) for Bluetooth data, disabling Bluetooth and any Bluetooth scanning option in your device settings; or (iii) for WiFi data, disabling WiFi and any WiFi scanning option in your device settings. You can stop collection of all location data via an app by uninstalling the app. 

Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there is no industry consensus as to what site and app operators should do with regard to these signals. 

If you disable cookies or other device tracking features, however, you may not be able to use certain functions of the Web Sites or Applications.

California consumers are California residents who are either within California or outside of California on a temporary basis. California consumers includes direct customers, employees, and business to business customers. See “Exercising Your Rights” below for further information. 

Notice of Collection. In the past 12 months, we have collected the following categories of personal information enumerated in the CPRA:

For further details on the personal information we collect, including the sources we receive information from, review the “Information Collection” section. We collect and use these categories of personal information for the business and commercial purposes described in the “Information Use” section. We disclose this personal information to the categories of persons set out in the “Disclosure of Information” section above. 

Home Run Inn does not sell your personal information as the term “sell” is traditionally understood. However, some of our disclosures of personal information may be considered a “sale” or “share” as those terms are defined under CPRA. A “sale” is broadly defined under CPRA to include a disclosure for something of value, and a “share” is broadly defined under the CPRA to include a disclosure for cross-context behavioral advertising. We may collect, sell, or share the following categories of personal information for commercial purposes: identifiers, commercial or transactions information, internet activity, non-precise geolocation data and inferences. The categories of third parties to whom we may sell or share your personal information include, where applicable, vendors and other parties involved in cross-context behavioral advertising. For details about your rights regarding sales and shares, please see the “Right to Opt-Out” section below. 

We do not knowingly sell or share the personal information of minors under 16 years old who are California residents. 

Sensitive Personal Information 

In addition, we have collected the following categories of sensitive personal information (as described in the CPRA) in the past 12 months: personal information that reveals your precise geolocation. For further details on how we obtain this information, please review the “Information Collection” section above. 

We collect, use, and disclose this sensitive personal information as necessary to provide the services through our Websites and Application reasonably expected by an average consumer who requests such services, and for other permissible business purposes under the CPRA. 

We do not “sell” or “share” your sensitive personal information as those terms are defined by CPRA. 

Retention 

We retain each category of personal information, including sensitive personal information, for the length of time that is reasonably necessary for the purpose for which it was collected, and as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, prevent fraud, and enforce our agreements. 

Right to Know, Correct, and Delete 

If you are a California resident, you have the right to know certain information about our data practices. In particular, you have the right to request the following from us: 

* The categories of personal information that we collected about you; 

* The categories of sources from which the personal information was collected; 

* The categories of personal information about you we disclosed for a business purpose or sold or shared; 

* The categories of persons to whom the personal information was disclosed for a business purpose or sold or shared; and 

* The business or commercial purpose for collecting, selling, or sharing the personal information 

* You also have the right to request the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you. 

Unless you specify otherwise, the response will cover the 12-month period preceding our receipt of the request. Starting with personal information collected on or after January 1, 2023, you may request that we disclose details beyond the 12-month period, and we shall do so unless doing so proves impossible or would involve disproportionate effort. 

In addition, you have the right to correct (effective January 1, 2023) or delete the personal information we have collected from you. 

These rights also apply to sensitive personal information. 

To exercise any of these rights, please submit a request to the email address below. If you have an account with us, we may require you to use the account to submit the request. In the request, please specify which right you are seeking to exercise and the scope of the request. We will confirm receipt of your request within 10 days. We may require specific information from you to help us verify your identity and process your request. If we are unable to verify your identity, we may deny your requests to know or delete. 

Right to Opt Out 

To the extent Home Run Inn “sells” or “shares” your personal information as those terms are defined under the CPRA, you have the right to opt-out of the sale or sharing of your personal information, which you can exercise through by sending a request to the email address below. 

When you submit an opt-out, your opt-out will only apply to sales and shares of personal information through tracking technologies from the specific browser from which you submitted the opt-out because the connection between your browser identifiers and other personal information we have about you is not known to us. If you want the opt-out to also apply to other personal information we have about you (such as your contact information), please provide such information at the contact information in the section below. 

Authorized Agent 

You can designate an authorized agent to submit requests on your behalf. Requests must be submitted through the designated methods listed above. However, we will require written proof of the agent’s permission to do so and verify your identity directly. Please provide written proof via email to the address below.

You have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by us for the exercise of any your rights contained in this Privacy Policy, including but not limited to: 

* Denying goods or services to you; 

* Charging different prices or rates for goods or services, including through the use of discounts or other benefits or imposing penalties; 

* Providing a different level or quality of goods or services to you; or 

* Suggesting that you will receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.

**How Do I Exercise My Rights As A California Consumer?** 

If you are a California Consumer, you have certain privacy rights under the CCPA and CPRA. You may only make two requests as described below over a 12-month period. To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights reserved to California consumers, a consumer may submit a verifiable consumer request by either: 

* Accessing our web form at https://www.homeruninnpizza.com/contact/; or 

* By physically mailing your request to: 

Home Run Inn 

1300 Internationale Parkway 

Woodridge, IL 60517 

Only you or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf may make a verifiable consumer request related to your Personal Information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child. You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a one-year period. 

A verifiable consumer request must provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify that you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information (or an authorized representative thereof) and must describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. 

We cannot respond to a request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm that the Personal Information relates to you. 

We will endeavor to respond to all verifiable consumer requests within 45 days. If we require more time, up to 90 days total, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. 

**Additional Disclosures for Nevada Residents** 

Nevada law (NRS 603A.340) requires each business to establish a designated request address where Nevada consumers may submit requests directing the business not to sell certain kinds of personal information that the business has collected or will collect about the consumer. A sale under Nevada law is the exchange of personal information for monetary consideration by the business to a third party for the third party to license or sell the personal information to other third parties.

The Colorado Privacy Act (“CPA”), Connecticut Consumer Privacy Act (“CTCPA”), Oregon Consumer Privacy Act (“OCPA”), Texas’ Data Privacy and Security Act (“TDPSA”), Utah Consumer Privacy Act (“UCPA”), Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (“VCDPA”), and any amendments or acts thereto upon their effective dates provide additional rights to Colorado, Connecticut, Oregon, Texas, Utah, and Virginia residents, respectively. This section addresses those rights and applies only to the respective residents of Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, and Virginia. Any rights are effective December 31, 2023.

We will respond to your request within 45 days. If you have an account with us, we may require you to use the account to submit the request.
