================

**Acceptance of Terms of Use**

These Terms of Use govern your use of the online and mobile web site (the “Website” or, collectively, the “Websites“), and the tablet, smartphone and other applications and platforms, available through third party devices, (the “Application” or, collectively, the “Applications“), owned and/or operated by Home Run Inn, Inc. and its affiliates (hereinafter “Home Run Inn”). If you do not agree to these Terms of Use, you should not use the Websites or Applications. These Terms of Use are an ongoing contract between you and Home Run Inn and apply to your use of the Websites or Applications. These Terms of Use affect your rights and you should read them carefully.

**Changes to Terms of Use**

Home Run Inn reserves the right, from time to time, with or without notice to you, to change these Terms of Use (other than the arbitration provision) in our sole and absolute discretion. The most current version of the Terms of Use will supersede all previous versions.

**Privacy and Personal Information**

Home Run Inn is committed to protecting the privacy of the personal information you provide us on our Websites and Applications. Any information submitted on the Websites and Applications is subject to our Privacy Policy, the terms of which are incorporated herein. Please review our Privacy Policy to understand our practices. The date of any changes to our Privacy Policy will be noted at the bottom of our Privacy Policy.

**Your Account**

If you use the Websites or Applications, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password and for restricting access to your computer, smartphone or tablet, and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password. The Websites and Applications sell products to adults, who can purchase with a credit card. If you are under 18, you may use the Websites and Applications only with involvement of a parent or guardian. Home Run Inn and its affiliates reserve the right to refuse service, terminate accounts, remove or edit content, or cancel orders in their sole discretion.

**Home Run Inn Websites and Applications**

These Terms of Use apply to all users of the Websites and Applications, including users who are also contributors of video content, voice content, information, and other materials or services on the Websites or Applications. The Websites and Applications may contain links to third party websites or applications, or may be made available through third party devices, that are not owned or controlled by Home Run Inn. Home Run Inn has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party websites, applications or devices. In addition, Home Run Inn will not and cannot censor or edit the content of any third-party site, application or device. By using the Websites or Applications, you expressly relieve Home Run Inn from any and all liability arising from your use of any third-party website, application or device. Accordingly, we encourage you to be aware when you leave the Websites or Applications and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each other website, application and device that you visit.

**Website/Application Access**

Home Run Inn hereby grants you permission to use the Websites and Applications as set forth in this Terms of Use, provided that: (i) your use of the Websites and Applications as permitted are solely for your personal, noncommercial use; (ii) you will not copy or distribute any part of the Websites or Applications in any medium without Home Run Inn prior written authorization; (iii) you will not alter or modify any part of the Websites or Applications other than as may be reasonably necessary to use the Websites or Applications for their intended purpose; and (iv) you will otherwise comply with the terms and conditions of these Terms of Use.

You must notify Home Run Inn immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account. Although Home Run Inn will not be liable for your losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account, you may be liable for the losses of Home Run Inn or others due to such unauthorized use.

You agree not to use or launch any automated system, including without limitation, “robots,” “spiders,” “offline readers,” etc., that accesses the Websites or Applications in a manner that sends more request messages to the Home Run Inn servers in a given period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a convention on-line web browser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Home Run Inn grants the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the site for the sole purpose of creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials.

Except where otherwise noted, the text, graphics and html code contained here may not be copied, distributed, displayed, reproduced or transmitted in any form or by any means without the prior written permission of Home Run Inn.

Home Run Inn makes no representations or warranties about the content, completeness, or accuracy of these links or the sites hyper-linked to the Websites or Applications. Furthermore, Home Run Inn does not implicitly endorse third-party sites hyper-linked to the Websites or Applications.

**Arbitration**

BECAUSE OF THE MUTUAL BENEFITS (SUCH AS REDUCED EXPENSE AND INCREASED EFFICIENCY) WHICH PRIVATE BINDING ARBITRATION CAN PROVIDE, BOTH YOU AND HOME RUN INN AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM, DISPUTE, AND/OR CONTROVERSY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO YOUR USE OF THE WEB SITES OR THE APPLICATIONS, ANY PRODUCTS SOLD BY HOME RUN INN THROUGH THE WEBSITES OR THE APPLICATIONS, THESE TERMS OF USE, OR THE SCOPE OR VALIDITY OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT SHALL BE SUBMITTED TO AND RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY BY BINDING ARBITRATION, RATHER THAN IN COURT, EXCEPT THAT YOU MAY ASSERT CLAIMS IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT IF YOUR CLAIMS QUALIFY. ALL MATTERS RELATING TO ARBITRATION WILL BE GOVERNED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT, 9 U.S.C. SECTIONS 1‐16, AND NOT BY ANY STATE ARBITRATION LAW.

The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted by a single arbitrator. In addition to any requirements imposed by law, the arbitrator shall be a retired state or federal court judge, or a licensed attorney with arbitration experience and at least ten years’ experience as a lawyer, and shall be subject to disqualification on the same grounds as would apply to a judge of a court in the relevant jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall follow controlling law and issue a decision in writing within 45 days of the arbitration hearing with a supporting opinion based on applicable law. The decision of the arbitrator (the “Decision”) shall be final, binding, and conclusive on the parties and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction; provided, however, that You and Home Run Inn agree that the Decision may be appealed pursuant to the AAA’s Optional Appellate Arbitration Rules (“Appellate Rules”), which may be obtained at http://www.adr.org or by calling (800)778‐7879. The Decision shall not be considered final until after the time for filing the notice of appeal pursuant to the Appellate Rules has expired. Appeals must be initiated within thirty (30) days of receipt of the Decision, as defined by Rule A-3 of the Appellate Rules, by filing a Notice of Appeal with any AAA office. The single appellate arbitrator, who shall be chosen in the same manner described above, shall review the Decision applying the same standard(s) of review applicable in civil cases in the relevant jurisdiction and shall issue a reasoned award. The appellate arbitrator’s decision shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties, and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. At either party’s election, such decision and supporting opinion may be appealed to another arbitrator (“appellate arbitrator”), who shall be chosen in the same manner as described above. The appellate arbitrator shall apply to the underlying decision and opinion the same standard for review of civil cases as an appellate court in the relevant jurisdiction and issue a decision in writing with a supporting opinion based on such review and applicable law. The appellate arbitrator’s decision shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND NOT ON A CLASS-WIDE, COLLECTIVE, MULTIPLE‐PARTY, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL BASIS. WE ALSO AGREE THAT ANY ARBITRATION PROCEEDING BETWEEN US MAY NOT BE CONSOLIDATED WITH ANY OTHER ARBITRATION BETWEEN HOME RUN INN AND ANY OTHER PERSON. YOU AND HOME RUN INN BOTH UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THIS BINDING ARBITRATION PROVISION, BOTH ARE GIVING UP THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY INDIVIDUAL, CLASS-WIDE, COLLECTIVE, MULTIPLE‐PARTY, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL, OR OTHER CLAIM EITHER MAY HAVE AGAINST THE OTHER, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN.

Should any term or provision or portion of this arbitration agreement be declared void or unenforceable or deemed in contravention of law, it shall be severed and/or modified and the remainder of this agreement shall be enforceable; provided, however, that if the provision above prohibiting class-wide, collective action, consolidated, or other group arbitration is deemed invalid, then this entire arbitration provision shall be null and void and shall not apply to that dispute, which shall be resolved in a judicial proceeding in Cook County, Illinois.

**General**

You agree that: (i) the Websites and Applications shall be deemed solely based in Illinois; and (ii) the Websites and Applications shall be deemed passive websites and applications that do not give rise to personal jurisdiction over Home Run Inn, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than Illinois. These Terms of Use shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of Illinois, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. These Terms of Use, together with the Privacy Policy and any other legal notices published by Home Run Inn on the Websites or Applications, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Home Run Inn concerning the Websites and Applications. If any provision of these Terms of Use is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms of Use, which shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any term of this these Terms of Use shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and the failure by Home Run Inn to assert any right or provision under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Home Run Inn reserves the right to amend these Terms of Use (other than the arbitration provision) at any time and without notice, and it is your responsibility to review these Terms of Use for any changes. YOU AND HOME RUN INN AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE WEBSITES AND APPLICATIONS MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.

**California Transparency in Supply Chains Act**

As a company philosophy, Home Run Inn, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates strongly oppose any and all illegal and unethical treatment of individuals, including acts of slavery or human trafficking. Home Run Inn utilizes a standard agreement that requires its suppliers to comply with all applicable laws, which includes applicable labor laws. Home Run Inn also provides to its suppliers a Code of Ethics that similarly notifies suppliers of their obligation to comply with all applicable laws and also provides a dedicated avenue for reporting any illegal or unethical behavior. Home Run Inn conducts periodic assessments of its suppliers and is determining whether to expand this assessment to obtain information about its suppliers’ activities related to the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010. Home Run Inn is also considering implementing requests for certification from its suppliers and/or audits of its suppliers. At this time, Home Run Inn does not plan to utilize a third party to perform any verifications or audits. Home Run Inn also expects to evaluate whether training and/or changes in accountability standards and procedures for its employees and/or contractors are appropriate.

These Terms of Use were updated as of February 7, 2023.
