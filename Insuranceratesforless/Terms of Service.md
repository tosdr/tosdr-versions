**12**. **ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER**

Any controversy or claim arising out of or related to the use of the Site or Service that cannot be resolved through such informal process or through negotiation within 120 days shall be settled by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association, and judgment on the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitration will be conducted in the city of HOUSTON, TX but may proceed telephonically (if the claimant so chooses).  IF YOU INITIATE AN ARBITRATION, insuranceratesforless.com WILL PROMPTLY REIMBURSE YOU FOR ANY STANDARD FILING FEE WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN REQUIRED UNDER PROCEDURES ONCE YOU HAVE NOTIFIED insuranceratesforless.com IN WRITING AND PROVIDED A COPY OF THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS. 

BY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.  In arbitration, a dispute is resolved by a neutral arbitrator or panel of arbitrators, rather than by a judge or jury.  Arbitration is more informal than a court trial; however, an arbitrator can award the same relief that a court can award.  The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), and may be conducted under AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, the “AAA Rules”) then in effect at the time of the dispute.  You may obtain copies of the AAA Rules and forms and instructions for initiating arbitration by visiting the AAA website at www.adr.org, or by calling AAA at (800) 788-7879. 

You agree that disputes will only be arbitrated on an individual basis and shall not be consolidated, on a class wide, representative basis, or with any other arbitration(s) or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party. If for any reason this arbitration clause is unenforceable or inapplicable, both you and we agree, to the extent permissible by law, to waive any right to pursue any claims on a class action basis. If any portion of this class action waiver is limited, void, or unenforceable, then our agreement to arbitrate under this section will not apply and any controversy or claim must be brought exclusively in the state and federal courts in TEXAS.

**13. Governing Law**

Our Terms of Use and your use of our Site shall be construed, governed by and enforced under the substantive laws of the State of Texas applicable to contracts made, executed and wholly performed within the State of Texas. The Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act does not apply to our Terms of Use.  A printed version of this Agreement and of any related notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to this Agreement to the same extent as other documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.  Please contact insuranceratesforless.com if you wish to receive a printed copy of this Agreement.  Any claim you might have against insuranceratesforless.com must be brought within one (1) year after the cause of action arises, or such claim or cause of action is barred.

**14. Injunctive Relief**

You acknowledge that any breach, threatened or actual, of our Terms of Use, including, without limitation, with respect to unauthorized use of insuranceratesforless.com proprietary assets, will cause irreparable injury to insuranceratesforless.com , such injury would not be quantifiable in monetary damages, and insuranceratesforless.com would not have an adequate remedy at law.
