Last updated: December 2, 2022

Fastweb LLC (“Fastweb”, “we”, “our”) is committed to protecting the privacy of our users. We want you to understand how we protect your personal information when we provide you with your results from customized searches for scholarships, college admissions and jobs. We will tell you what types of personal information that we collect, what may happen to that information, and your rights regarding your personal information.

Scope of This Privacy Policy
----------------------------

This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) applies to information we collect or use on Fastweb.com, Finaid.org, and mobile apps published by Fastweb.

Types of Information We Collect
-------------------------------

Information We Collect Directly from You:

We collect information from you when you choose to give it to us either on our website or through our mobile app. This includes:

* Registration information, such as your name, date of birth, e-mail address, street address, phone number, gender, citizenship status, ethnicity, military status, educational history, and your username and password;
* Optional categories of information, if you choose to provide them, including career objectives, health information, hobbies, and other personal information, which we use to maximize the effectiveness of your scholarship college admissions and job searches on our website; and
* Additional optional information for participation in surveys or contests, which is completely voluntary on your part, and you have the choice about whether to disclose the information necessary to use these features.

Information Automatically Collected From You When You Use Finaid:

We also gather certain information automatically when you visit our website or use our mobile app. This information is passively collected, and Finaid uses it for internal purposes, including, but not limited to, testing, improving a user’s experience and disclosures to advertisers and content partners. Finaid only discloses aggregate passive information to advertisers and content partners, including unique visits to our website and impression data. Passive information alone does not identify you to Finaid by name.

This information may include, without limitation, the following:

* internet protocol (IP) address;
* browser type and configuration;
* device ID; and
* your activity on Finaid, including where you go on our website or mobile app, how you interact with any specific part of our website or mobile app and how long you stay on any specific part of our website or mobile app.

Collection of Information from Children
---------------------------------------

Finaid is not intended for, nor do we knowingly collect information from, children under the age of 16.

Finaid may collect information from children who are 16 if they are looking for information on scholarships or jobs.

How We Use Information
----------------------

We use the information we collect to provide our services, respond to you, for marketing purposes, improve our site, and foster a positive user experience.

**Automatic Decision Making**

Information you supply will be used to help determine which scholarships you may be eligible for and narrow the total number of scholarships in our database to those relevant to you.

How We Share Information
------------------------

**Information Shared with Third Party Service Providers**

From time to time, Finaid may decide to use third parties to perform specific services, such as sending newsletters to Finaid users. If Finaid engages a service provider, then some personal information may be shared with the service provider, but only to the extent and purpose necessary for the service provider to provide services on Finaid’s behalf.

Finaid uses third-party service providers for the following types of tasks:

* sales and marketing assistance;
* analytics;
* data visualization;
* customer service;
* development and improvement of products and services; and
* system monitoring

**Sale of Information**

Finaid will not knowingly sell, share, rent, or otherwise transfer your information other than in accordance with the terms set forth in this Privacy Policy.

Finaid is able to offer its free services, in part, based on the willingness of our users to be contacted by colleges or our marketing partners. By agreeing, you acknowledge and agree that the information you supply may be sold to colleges and leading companies. In return, you’ll receive free information on college financing and admissions, offers and promotions designed for students, job opportunities, and more.

If you give your permission to allow third parties to contact you, personal information about you, such as your name, gender, age, zip code, citizenship, educational history, and other information collected during your visit to Finaid’s website, may be shared with colleges, universities, potential employers, recruiters/headhunters, data aggregators, marketers, and other organizations. You may opt out of the sale of your data when you are first prompted, or by sending a request to [support@finaid.org](mailto:support@finaid.org).

Our use of tracking technologies may be considered a “sale” under California law. You can opt-out of being tracked by these third parties by clicking “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” link at the bottom of our website and selecting your preferences, or by broadcasting the global privacy control signal. Read more about our use of tracking technologies in the Cookies and Online Advertising Section below.

**Information Shared with Business Partners**

Regardless of your decision regarding the sharing of your personal information, Finaid may share broad aggregate demographic data and related usage information with Finaid’s business partners. When your personal information has been aggregated, it can no longer be attributed to a specific individual, meaning it is data that does not contain individual-level information that can be tied back to a specific individual.

I**nformation Shared Per Legal Requirement**

While Finaid strives to protect its users’ personal information, Finaid discloses personal information to third parties if legally required to do so, if a governmental entity requests Finaid to do so, or if Finaid believes in good faith that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal processes; (b) protect the rights or property of Finaid or affiliated companies; (c) prevent a crime or protect national security; or (d) protect the personal safety of users or the public.
