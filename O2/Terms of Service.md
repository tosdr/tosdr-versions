**Interactive services**

We may from time to time provide interactive services on our site, including, without limitation:

* Chat rooms.
    
* Bulletin boards.
    

(**interactive services.**)

Where we do provide any interactive service, we will provide clear information to you about the kind of service offered, if it is moderated and what form of moderation is used (including whether it is human or technical).

Where relevant we will do our best to assess any possible risks for users (and in particular, for children) from third parties when they use any interactive service provided on our site, and we will decide in each case whether it is appropriate to use moderation of the relevant service (including what kind of moderation to use) in the light of those risks. However, we are under no obligation to oversee, monitor or moderate any interactive service we provide on our site, and we expressly exclude our liability for any loss or damage arising from the use of any interactive service by a user in contravention of our content standards, whether the service is moderated or not.

The use of any of our interactive services by a minor (under 18) is subject to the consent of their parent or guardian. We advise parents who permit their children to use an interactive service that it is important that they communicate with their children about their safety online, as moderation is not fool proof. Minors who are using any interactive service should be made aware of the potential risks to them.

Where we do moderate an interactive service, we will normally provide you with a means of contacting the moderator, should a concern or difficulty arise.

**Content standards**

These content standards apply to any and all material which you contribute to our site (**Contribution**), and to any interactive services associated with it.

The Content Standards must be complied with in spirit as well as to the letter. The standards apply to each part of any Contribution as well as to its whole.

O2 will determine, in its discretion, whether a Contribution breaches the Content Standards.

A Contribution must:

* Be accurate (where it states facts).
    
* Be genuinely held (where it states opinions).
    
* Comply with the law applicable in England and Wales and in any country from which it is posted.
    

A Contribution must not:

* Be defamatory of any person.
    
* Be obscene, offensive, hateful or inflammatory.
    
* Bully, insult, intimidate or humiliate.
    
* Promote sexually explicit material.
    
* Include child sexual abuse material.
    
* Promote violence.
    
* Promote discrimination based on race, sex, religion, nationality, disability, sexual orientation or age.
    
* Infringe any copyright, database right or trade mark of any other person.
    
* Be likely to deceive any person.
    
* Breach any legal duty owed to a third party, such as a contractual duty or a duty of confidence.
    
* Promote any illegal content or activity.
    
* Be in contempt of court.
    
* Be threatening, abuse or invade another's privacy, or cause annoyance, inconvenience or needless anxiety.
    
* Be likely to harass, upset, embarrass, alarm or annoy any other person.
    
* Impersonate any person or misrepresent your identity or affiliation with any person.
    
* Give the impression that the Contribution emanates from O2, if this is not the case.
    
* Advocate, promote, incite any party to commit, or assist any unlawful or criminal act such as (by way of example only) copyright infringement or computer misuse.
    
* Contain a statement which you know or believe, or have reasonable grounds for believing, that members of the public to whom the statement is, or is to be, published are likely to understand as a direct or indirect encouragement or other inducement to the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism.
    
* Contain any advertising or promote any services or web links to other sites.
    

**Breach of this policy**

When we consider that a breach of this Privacy Policy has occurred, we may take such action as we deem appropriate.

Failure to comply with this Privacy Policy constitutes a material breach of the terms of use upon which you are permitted to use our site, and may result in our taking all or any of the following actions:

* Immediate, temporary or permanent withdrawal of your right to use our site.
    
* Immediate, temporary or permanent removal of any Contribution uploaded by you to our site.
    
* Issue of a warning to you.

* Further legal action against you.
    
* Disclosure of such information to law enforcement authorities as we reasonably feel is necessary or as required by law.
    

We exclude our liability for all action we may take in response to breaches of this Privacy Policy. The actions we may take are not limited to those described above, and we may take any other action we reasonably deem appropriate.

**Which country's laws apply to any disputes?**

If you are a consumer, please note that these terms of use, their subject matter and their formation, are governed by English law. You and we both agree that the courts of England and Wales will have exclusive jurisdiction except that if you are a resident of Northern Ireland you may also bring proceedings in Northern Ireland, and if you are resident of Scotland, you may also bring proceedings in Scotland.

If you are a business, these terms of use, their subject matter and their formation (and any non-contractual disputes or claims) are governed by English law. We both agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.
