### About Us:

Share My Lesson is a website offering free lesson sharing, funded by the American Federation of Teachers (AFT). Built by educators across the country, we bring together a community of teachers, paraprofessionals, school-related personnel, parents, partners, union members and nonunion members to join in our effort to provide high-quality education to all students. Share My Lesson was created by the AFT and TES Global in 2012. From the beginning, Share My Lesson has been committed to providing our community of members high-quality and effective lessons, useful information to use in the classroom, and professional development. 

Share My Lesson is owned by the American Federation of Teachers, AFL-CIO.

The American Federation of Teachers is a union of professionals that champions fairness; democracy; economic opportunity; and high-quality public education, healthcare and public services for our students, their families and our communities. We are committed to advancing these principles through community engagement, organizing, collective bargaining and political activism, and especially through the work our members do.

#### 1\. Your sharemylesson.com Account

If you create an account on sharemylesson.com, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your account, and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under the account and any other actions taken in connection with the account. You must immediately notify AFT of any unauthorized uses of your account, or any other breaches of security. AFT will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions.

#### 2\. Responsibility of Contributors

If you post resources to sharemylesson.com or otherwise make (or allow any third party to make) material available (hereinafter, Content), you are entirely responsible for the Content of, and any harm resulting from, that Content. That is the case regardless of what form the Content takes, which includes, but is not limited to text, photo, video, audio or code. You must not post Content that is copyrighted unless you are the copyright owner or have permission from the copyright owner to share it. By making Content available, you represent and warrant that your Content does not violate these Terms of Service. By submitting Content to AFT for inclusion on sharemylesson.com, you grant AFT a worldwide, royalty-free and nonexclusive license to reproduce, modify, adapt and publish the Content for the purpose of displaying, distributing, operating and promoting sharemylesson.com. Further, by clicking that you agree to this Terms of Service agreement, you are affirming that you acknowledge, consent and agree that AFT may access the Content if required to do so by law or if based on a good faith belief that such access, preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with the legal process; (b) enforce these Terms and Conditions; (c) respond to claims that any Content violates the rights of any third party; (d) respond to your requests for customer or technical service; or (e) protect the rights, property or personal safety of AFT, its users or any third parties. The rights afforded to AFT under this section may not be exercised by AFT, its affiliates or related entities for any other purpose whatsoever.

The license described in this section of the Terms of Service does not apply to other users on the site that may want to share your Content. In order for users to be able to share their Content with other users, they must grant another license to those users. The section of this Terms of Service titled “Rights in Posted Content” describes how users can license their Content on sharemylesson.com for other users to share. 

#### 3\. Rights in Posted Content

_Content uploaded by a user to sharemylesson.com remains the property of that user._ Nothing in these Terms of Service shall be construed to take that ownership right away from any user. AFT values sharemylesson.com as a community of education professionals and parents who choose to freely share their resources with each other, and AFT will always respect that resources are the property of the educators whose time and talent went into their creation. This is our solemn promise and commitment to you.

In order for users to be able to share their Content with each other, it is necessary for users to license their Content to be shared. A license may grant users and downloaders of Content certain rights to make use of such Content, but can never transfer ownership. AFT has chosen to utilize two of the Creative Commons licenses to enable legal sharing of resources. Creative Commons is a nonprofit organization that enables the sharing and use of creativity and knowledge through free legal tools. Their free, easy-to-use copyright licenses provide a simple, standardized way to give the public permission to share and use your creative work—on conditions of your choice. For example, Creative Commons licenses let you easily change your copyright terms from the default of “all rights reserved” to “some rights reserved.” Creative Commons licenses are not an alternative to copyright. They work alongside copyright and enable you to modify your copyright terms to best suit your needs. More information on the Creative Commons organization and the services it provides may be found here: [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/).

Sharemylesson.com provides users a choice of two Creative Commons licenses to use to license their resources:

1. Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike -CC BY-NC-SA. This license lets others remix, tweak, and build upon your work non-commercially, as long as they credit you and license their new creations under the identical terms. The license deed may be found here: [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/). And the license legal code is here: [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode).
    
2. Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs-CC BY-NC-ND. This license permits others to download your works and share them with others as long as they credit you, but they cannot change them in any way or use them commercially. The license deed may be found here: [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/). And the license legal code is here: [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/legalcode](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/legalcode).
    
3. Public Domain Dedication CC0 1.0 Universal. Allows others to copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission. The license deed may be found here: [https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0). And the license legal code is here: [https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode).
    

If you choose to delete Content and do not reside in a European Union (EU) country, AFT will use reasonable efforts to remove it from sharemylesson.com, but you acknowledge that caching or references to the Content may not be made immediately unavailable. Without limiting any of the foregoing, AFT has the right (though not the obligation) to, at AFT’s sole discretion, (1) refuse or remove any content that, in AFT’s reasonable opinion, violates any AFT policy or is in any way harmful or objectionable, or (2) terminate or deny access to and use of sharemylesson.com to any individual or entity for any reason.

Residents of the EU have the “right to be forgotten,” and formal requests for the deletion of content pursuant to the EU’s regulations will be made by you to SML’s compliance officer. By agreeing to these Terms of Service, you acknowledge your responsibility to properly notify SML’s compliance officer in the event you choose to invoke your right as an EU resident to be forgotten. Please read SML’s [Privacy Policy](https://sharemylesson.com/share-my-lesson-privacy-policy) for more information regarding the collection of information.

#### 4\. Responsibility of Visitors

AFT has not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the Content, including computer software, posted to our Services, and cannot therefore be responsible for that material’s content, use or effects.

You are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content. Our Services may contain content that is offensive, indecent or otherwise objectionable, as well as content containing technical inaccuracies, typographical mistakes and other errors. Our Services may also contain material that violates the privacy or publicity rights, or infringes the intellectual property and other proprietary rights, of third parties, or the downloading, copying or use of which is subject to additional terms of service, stated or unstated. AFT disclaims any responsibility for any harm resulting from the use by visitors of our Services, or from any downloading by those visitors of Content posted there.

8. upload, post, email or otherwise transmit any material that contains software viruses or any other computer code, files or programs designed to interrupt, damage, destroy or limit the functionality of any computer software or hardware or telecommunications equipment;

You acknowledge that AFT does not pre-screen Content that you post on the Service, but that AFT and people designated by it shall have the right (but not the obligation) to monitor communications that occur through, and posts made to, the Service. If AFT determines, at its sole discretion, that you or another user has breached these Terms of Service or that any Content is inappropriate or otherwise objectionable, AFT may refuse to accept or may remove any Content from the Service, without any liability to you or a third party. AFT reserves the right to investigate and take appropriate legal action against anyone who, at AFT’s sole discretion, violates or is suspected of violating this section.

Any individual that AFT believes has violated SML’s Terms of Service, may have their account suspended or terminated. If AFT believes an individual has violated SML’s Terms of Service more than once, that SML user account will be terminated, suspended, or any other action AFT and SML deem necessary to enforce SML’s Terms of Service. This, however, does not reduce SML’s right to terminate or suspend an account without cause.

#### 6\. Content Posted on Other Websites

We have not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material, including computer software, made available through the resources or websites to which sharemylesson.com links, and that link to sharemylesson.com. AFT does not have any control over those non-sharemylesson.com websites, and is not responsible for their contents or their use. By linking to a non-sharemylesson.com website, AFT does not represent or imply that it endorses such website. You are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content. AFT disclaims any responsibility for any harm resulting from your use of non-sharemylesson.com websites and webpages.

If you believe that your Content was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner’s agent, or pursuant to applicable law, to make such content available to SML for use on the Service, you may send a counter-notice containing the following information to our Designated Agent:
