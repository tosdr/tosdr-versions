1\. Personal Information Collection and Use
-------------------------------------------

This Privacy Policy covers our use of Personal Information. "**Personal Information**," means any information that relates to you and can -- either on its own or in combination with other information -- identify you as an individual. Personal information does not include information that has been de-identified or aggregated such that you can no longer be identified.

The types of information we collect depends on your level of engagement with the Services. The more you interact with the Services, the more information we need to provide the Services. This Section explains how we collect and use personal information based on your level of engagement with the Services.

### A. All Users of the Redfin Sites and Applications

From registered and unregistered users of the Sites, we automatically receive and record information whenever you interact with the Sites. This includes IP address data from our server logs, cookie information, browser information, information about your activity while on the Sites (such as the pages you request, properties that you view or save, and property that you claim), and the URL of the site you came to the Sites from. We also may collect the mobile device ID (such as the ID for Advertising on iOS and Android ID on Android) from users of the Redfin Applications. If permitted by the settings on your device and/or with your consent, we will also collect your geo-location information. We use this to provide you with location-specific information, such as homes for sale near your current location as determined by your geolocation, and information about listing your home for sale based on your geolocation. We may also approximate your location based on your IP address, to customize your experience on our Sites.

We may also use the information listed above to help diagnose problems and performance with the Services, analyze trends, customize your experience, and administer the Services. We may provide IP addresses to third-parties to help us analyze website user survey data. We may also use the information described in this section to better target information about Redfin's Sites and Services, for example, by displaying more accurate or relevant information on our Sites, matching you to a public record listing of a property, tailoring the advertising we display on third party websites and platforms, and sending better targeted and tailored messages, including via email and/or push notifications.

### B. Registered Users of the Redfin Sites and Applications

We are required to collect certain information, including your name and email address, as a condition of our licenses with the multiple real estate listing services (the "**MLSs**") in order to allow you to access the full MLS listings. You give us this information when you create your Redfin account. When you give us this information at one of our events, or upon your request, we will create a Redfin account for you, and you agree that this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use apply. In addition, when you are signed into your Redfin account and using Redfin through Facebook, Twitter, or any other third-party authorization service, we may make use of the information that they provide us to further customize your Redfin experience. We may share Personal Information with such third parties to deliver Redfin tailored content both on our Services and on third party sites (e.g., social media sites).

* **My Redfin**: My Redfin is a feature that allows you to upload notes and photos about a property, save searches, add favorites and x-outs, and otherwise organize homes that may interest you. We save all of this "My Redfin" information for use later in connection with our Services. It is stored with your Redfin account information.
    
* **Account Password Security**: Your Redfin account password is encrypted on our server. It is your responsibility not to disclose your password to other people and to ensure you maintain its security.
    
* **Account Updates**: By visiting your [My Redfin: Account Settings](https://www.redfin.com/myredfin/settings), you can correct, amend, add or delete Personal Information associated with your account. However, even after you update information, we may maintain a copy of the original information in our records as required by applicable law or other legal obligation.
    

### C. Home Tours, Real Estate Classes, and other In-Person Meetings

When you submit a home tour request, we will ask for your tour date and time preferences, as well as your phone number. We may ask for similar information when you request or attend a home buying or selling class, or when you request or attend a strategy session or similar in-person meeting with a Redfin agent. We may also ask some questions so that our agent can verify your identity, and such information will be used to register you for a Redfin account. When you meet up with one of our agents, the agent may ask you to verify your identity and may even ask to see a photo ID.

### D. Redfin Clients

When you are getting ready to buy or sell a home and you start working with our coordinators and agents, you become a Redfin client. As part of the home purchase or sale process, you will need to provide a lot of information as is customary for a home purchase or sale transaction. This information can include, without limitation, your name, address, phone number, email address, financial or payment information, including without limitation, buyer loan pre-approval documentation and seller property information. We ask you, as a buyer, for loan pre-approvals from a mortgage broker or lender to determine which homes are in your price range and to help you make an offer more quickly when you do find a home. You, as a seller, may be legally required to disclose certain information about your property to prospective buyers. Once you sign a listing agreement or buyer agreement with us, your relationship with Redfin is governed by that agreement, as well as our online [Terms of Use](https://www.redfin.com/about/terms-of-use) and this Privacy Policy.

### E. Communications with Redfin

Redfin may collect Personal Information from you such as email address, phone number, or mailing address when you request information about our Services, register for our newsletter, request customer or technical support, or otherwise communicate with us.

### F. Marketing

We may send marketing materials to Redfin account holders and clients using various communication channels, including without limitation, email, text messages/SMS, push notifications, telephone calls, and direct mail. Individuals may also subscribe to Listing Alert Emails or other notifications with information such as customized summaries of homes for sale. Redfin may send you Redfin-related news and surveys in accordance with applicable law.

### G. Call Recording

We may record any telephone calls between you and our agents or other representatives for training and quality assurance purposes.

### H. Surveys

Redfin may contact you to participate in surveys. If you decide to participate, you may be asked to provide certain information, which may include Personal Information.

### I. Sharing with Friends or Colleagues

Redfin's Services may allow you to forward or share certain content with a friend or colleague, such as an email inviting your friend to use our Services. Email addresses that you may provide for a friend or colleague will be used to send your friend or colleague the content or link you request in accordance with applicable law.

### J. Interactive Features

Redfin may offer interactive features such as chat services, forums, and social media pages. We may collect the information you submit or make available through these features. Any content you provide on the public sections of these channels will be considered "public" and will not be subject to the privacy protections referenced herein.

### K. De-Identified and Aggregated Information

We may use Personal Information and other information about you to create de-identified and/or aggregated information, such as de-identified demographic information, de-identified location information, de-identified or aggregated trends, reports, or statistics, information about the computer or device from which you access our Services, or other analyses we create. De-identified and aggregated information is used for a variety of functions, including the measurement of visitors' interest in and use of various portions or features of the Sites and Services. De-identified and aggregated information is not Personal Information, and we may use and disclose such information in a number of ways, including research, internal analysis, analytics, and any other legally permissible purpose.

### L. Conferences and Trade Shows

### O. Other Uses of Information

In addition to the specific collection and uses listed above, we may use any of the Personal Information we collect for the following business purposes:

While we do not exchange your Personal Information with others for monetary consideration, we may share your Personal Information with the following categories of third parties as part of our Services to you or to assist us in conducting our marketing and advertising, or for other business or commercial purposes listed above in this Privacy Policy.

### A. Public Record Information

Please be aware that home sales and purchases may be a matter of public record, and your name and address, the price you paid, your property taxes, and other information may be available from public sites regardless of the brokerage(s), if any, who assist in the transaction. We post on our Sites some information that typically becomes part of the public record of a home sale or purchase.

### B. Non-Public Record Information

We share information obtained from you, MLSs and other third-party sources that is not on the public record to facilitate your home purchase or sale transaction. This includes:

* **Service Providers to all Redfin Clients**: Our agents work with third parties to process your home search and sale transaction and must share your information with those third parties. Examples include MLSs and providers of software used for document preparation and electronic signing.
    
* **Partner Agents**: A Partner Agent is employed by or works with another brokerage and is not a representative or employee of Redfin. Partner Agents have contracted with us to provide Redfin-quality service to a wider range of customers. We'll refer you to a Partner Agent at our discretion. If you are referred to a Partner Agent for your home purchase or sale transaction, we share your information with that Partner Agent so they can assist you. Redfin is not responsible for the work performed or the services provided by Partner Agents in any manner.
    
* **Home Seller Service Providers**: As is customary as your home sales agent, we share your listing information with MLSs and other listing websites, such as Realtor.com, Trulia.com and Zillow.com. As a result, your listing may appear on more than one website. We may also share your listing and contact information with listing vendors such as photographers, home staging experts and home repair professionals like plumbers and electricians, as needed.
    
* **Home Buyer Service Providers**: As is customary as your home purchase agent, we must share your buying information with inspectors, title companies, escrow agents, closing attorneys, lenders, and other third parties as needed to process your transaction.
    
* **Potential Buyers**: By law, we are required to disclose certain information about your property to potential buyers.
    

### C. Negotiations

We also post price offers and counteroffers on our Sites. We do not post your name on our Sites without your permission, but if the sale is closed, the price and the fact that you bought or sold your house at that price may be a matter of public record.

### D. Redfin Corporate Family

We may share your information with members of the Redfin family of entities for various purposes, including to: (i) provide the Services to you; (ii) help detect and prevent potentially illegal and fraudulent acts and other violations of our policies and agreements; (iii) help with marketing initiatives; and (iii) manage and improve Redfin products, Sites, Services and tools.

### E. Redfin Requests

Through the Services, you can make a request to tour a home, get in contact with a real estate agent, receive help selling or buying a home, or submit other requests. When you make such a request through Redfin, you authorize Redfin to share your Personal Information including your contact information, home search history, favorites and saved searches, with a real estate professional (a Redfin Agent or staff member, or a Partner Agent) for the purpose of responding to your request.

### F. Service Providers

We may share your Personal Information with third-party service providers that assist us in providing the Services. We use reasonable efforts to do so with the appropriate contractual protection in place to ensure that your Personal Information is protected and used only in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

### I. Targeted and Interest-Based Ad Providers

We may share the information that we collect about you with others (including advertising networks and service providers) to tailor and serve you ads on our Services, as well as other websites and social media networks. This practice is commonly referred to as "interest-based advertising" or "online behavioral advertising."

This allows Redfin to target our advertising to you through demographic, behavioral and contextual means. As a result, you may see ads for Redfin on other websites and social media.

### L. Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others

We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate: (i) to respond to claims or legal processes (including subpoenas); (ii) to protect our property, rights and safety and the property, rights and safety of a third party or the public in general; and (iii) to stop any activity that we consider illegal, unethical or legally actionable.

**Disclosures of Personal Information for a Business Purpose**

We may disclose your Personal Information to the third parties or others as described above in this Privacy Policy, for any of the business purposes described above in this Privacy Policy.

In the preceding twelve (12) months, we have disclosed the following categories of Personal Information in our role as a business for a business purpose:

* Internet or other electronic network activity information;
* Geolocation data;
* Audio, electronic, visual or similar information;
* Inferences; and
* Sensitive personal information

**Sensitive Personal Information**

Our collection, use, and disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information is generally limited to what is reasonable and proportionate for the following purposes:

* To perform the services or provide the goods as reasonably expected by you;
* To detect security incidents that compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality of sensitive Personal Information that is stored or transmitted;

**Sales and Sharing of Personal Information**

The CCPA defines “sale” broadly as “disclosing or making available Personal Information to a third party in exchange for monetary or other valuable consideration,” and “sharing” as “disclosing or making available personal information to a third party for purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising.” While we do not disclose personal information to third parties in exchange for monetary consideration, we may be considered to be “selling” or “sharing” certain categories of Personal Information to third parties through our use of ad companies, analytics providers, and social networks (through third party tags on our Sites) to improve and measure our ad campaigns and reach users with more relevant ads and content.

The categories of Personal Information that we may have “sold” or “shared” in the prior twelve (12) months include:

* identifiers;
* internet or other electronic network activity information;
* geolocation information; and
* inferences.

The categories of third parties under the CCPA to whom we have disclosed this information are:

* data analytics providers;
* advertising networks; and
* social networks.

We do not sell or share Personal Information about individuals we know are under age sixteen (16).

**Your CCPA Rights and Choices**

The CCPA provides consumers (California residents) with specific rights regarding their Personal Information. This section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights. Subject to certain exceptions, consumers have the right to make the following requests:

**_Right to Know/Access_**. You have the right to request (up to twice per year subject to certain exemptions), free of charge, that we disclose information about our collection and use of your Personal Information, including:

* The categories of Personal Information we collected about you;
* The categories of sources from which the Personal Information is collected;
* The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that Personal Information;
* The categories of third parties with whom we disclose Personal Information; and
* The specific pieces of Personal Information we have collected.

**_Right to Correct_**. Subject to certain conditions and exceptions, you have the right to request that we correct inaccuracies in your Personal Information.

**_Right to Delete_**. Subject to certain conditions and exceptions, you have the right to request that we delete your Personal Information. Once we receive and confirm your request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your Personal Information from our records, unless an exception applies.

**_Right to Opt-Out of Sales and Sharing_**. To exercise your right to opt-out of the “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information, please visit our _Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information_ page [here](https://www.redfin.com/about/privacy/cookie).

You also have the right to opt-out of “sales” and “sharing” of your Personal Information through the use of an opt-out preference signal. If our Site detects that your browser or device is transmitting an opt-out preference signal, such as the “global privacy control”—or GPC— signal, we will opt that browser or device out of cookies on our Site that result in a “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information. If you come to our Site from a different device or from a different browser on the same device, you will need to opt-out, or use an opt-out preference signal, for that browser and/or device as well.

Please note that, if you have entered your email address on our site, to fully opt-out of “sales” and “sharing” of Personal Information you will also need to use the LiveRamp opt-out tool by clicking [here](https://optout.liveramp.com/opt_out).

**_Right to Limit Use and Disclosure_**. We do not engage in uses or disclosures of “sensitive personal information” that would trigger the _Right to Limit Use of Sensitive Personal Information_ under the CCPA.

**_Right to Non-Discrimination_**. We will not discriminate against you in terms of price or service level for exercising any of the rights described in this section.

**_Authorized Agent_**. You may designate someone as an authorized agent to submit requests and act on your behalf. Authorized agents will be required to provide proof of their authorization in their first communication with us, and we may also require that you directly verify your identity and the authority of your authorized agent.

Businesses operating as an authorized agent on behalf of a California resident must provide both of the following:

* (1) Certificate of good standing with its state of organization; and
* (2) A written authorization document, signed by the California resident, containing the California resident’s name, address, telephone number, and valid email address, and expressly authorizing the business to act on behalf of the California resident.

Individuals operating as an authorized agent on behalf of a California resident must provide either of the following:

* (1) A notarized power of attorney signed and dated by the California resident naming the authorized agent as the California resident’s representative; or

We reserve the right to reject (1) authorized agents who have not fulfilled the above requirements, or (2) automated CCPA requests where we have reason to believe the security of the requestor’s personal information may be at risk.

**_Verification_**. Before responding to your request, we must first verify your identity using the Personal Information you recently provided to us. You must provide us with your full name, email address you used to contact us, and your address (if applicable). We will take steps to verify your request by matching the information provided by you with the information we have in our records. In some cases, we may request more information to verify your identity or where necessary to process your request. If we are unable to verify your identity after a good faith attempt, we may deny the request and, if so, will explain the basis for denial.

**California “Shine the Light” Disclosure**

California's "Shine the Light" law (Civil Code Section § 1798.83) permits users of our Sites and Services who are California residents to request, once per calendar year, certain information regarding our disclosure of Personal Information (if any) to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please contact us using the contact information provided below. Please include in your request a current California address and your attestation that you are a California resident.
