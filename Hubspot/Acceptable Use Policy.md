HubSpot Acceptable Use Policy
-----------------------------

Last Modified: September 18, 2024

This HubSpot Acceptable Use Policy ("AUP") applies to the use of any product, service or website provided by us (HubSpot), whether we provide it directly or use another party to provide it to you (each, a "HubSpot Service"). This AUP is designed to ensure compliance with the laws and regulations that apply to the HubSpot Service. This AUP also protects the interests of all of our clients and their customers, as well as our goodwill and reputation. These terms are so important that we cannot provide the HubSpot Service unless you agree to them. By using the HubSpot Service, you are agreeing to these terms. 

1\. [Reporting Suspected Violations](#Reporting-Suspected-Violations)

2\. [Prohibited Email Actions](#Prohibited-Email-Actions)

3\. [Email Opt-Out Requirements](#Email-Opt-Out-Requirements)

4\. [Telephone, Texting, and Messaging](#Telephone-Marketing)

5\. [No Disruption](#No-Disruption)

6\. [Proper Usage of the HubSpot Service](#Proper-Usage-of-HubSpot-Service)

7\. [Restricted Industries](#Restricted-Industries)

8\. [HubSpot Trademark Use](#HubSpot-Trademark-Use)

9\. [Developer Terms](#Developer-Terms)

10\. [General Terms](#General-Terms)

If you are using any HubSpot Service, this AUP applies to you. Every customer and user agrees to abide by this AUP and is responsible for any violations. You are not allowed to assist or engage others in a way that would violate this AUP. We will enforce and ensure compliance with this AUP by using methods we consider to be appropriate, such as complaint and email failure monitoring.  We may also suspend or terminate your use of HubSpot Services pursuant to our Customer Terms of Service for violations of this AUP. 

We periodically update these terms and we will let you know when we do through the Notification app in your HubSpot account (if you have one), or by posting a revised copy on our website. You agree to review the AUP on a regular basis and always remain in compliance.

### 1. **Reporting Suspected Violations**

We encourage recipients of email messages sent using the HubSpot Service to report suspected violations of this AUP to us by forwarding a copy of the received email with FULL headers to abuse@hubspot.com. We have a policy to investigate all of these reports and to respond in the way we consider appropriate. 

If you know of or suspect a violation of this AUP, you will promptly notify us in writing of the known or suspected violation of this AUP.

### 2. **Prohibited Email Actions** 

a. You may not use HubSpot to send spam. Spam can be in the form of bulk email or one to one commercial emails.

Bulk email is spam when it is unsolicited. Unsolicited means the recipient has not granted verifiable permission for the message to be sent. Bulk means that the message is sent as part of a larger collection of messages that have substantively similar content.  
One-to-one commercial emails are spam when they violate CAN-SPAM. One-to-one commercial emails are also considered Spam if the data processed for purposes of sending that email is in scope of the General Data Protection Regulation (‘GDPR’) and you fail to provide notice to individuals and establish a lawful basis of processing.

You may not use the HubSpot Service in any way (directly or indirectly) to send, transmit, handle, distribute or deliver: (i) spam in violation of the CAN-SPAM Act (referenced below) or any other law; (ii) email to an address obtained via Internet harvesting methods or any surreptitious methods (e.g., scraping or harvesting); (iii) email to an address that is incomplete, inaccurate and/or not updated for all applicable opt-out notifications, using best efforts and best practices in the industry, (iv) commercial electronic messages in violation of Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (referenced below), or (v) in violation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).   

b. You may not use any misleading or false names, addresses, email address, or subject line. 

Email sent, or caused to be sent to or through the HubSpot Service may not: (i) use or contain invalid or forged headers; (ii) use or contain invalid or non-existent domain names; (iii) employ any technique to otherwise misrepresent, hide or obscure any information in identifying the point of origin or the transmission path; (iv) use other means of deceptive addressing; (v) use a third party's internet domain name without their consent, or be relayed from or through a third party's equipment without the third party’s permission; (vi) contain false or misleading information in the subject line or otherwise contain false or misleading content; or (vii) use our trademark(s), tagline(s), or logo(s) without our prior written consent and only then pursuant to our trademark usage guidelines.

If you use email, we recommend that you adopt the Messaging, Malware and Mobile Anti-Abuse Working Group (M3AAWG) Sender Best Communications Practices (BCP), which were created and agreed upon with collaborative input from both volume email senders and Internet Service Providers. The Sender Best Communications Practices document is available [here](https://www.m3aawg.org/sites/default/files/document/M3AAWG_Senders_BCP_Ver3-2015-02.pdf). You will use commercially reasonable efforts to follow these practices.

c. You may not email purchased lists. 

You are prohibited from using the HubSpot Service to engage in email practices that are likely to have high levels of bounces, increased spam complaints, and the potential for blocklisting by anti-spam providers, including but not limited to the following:    
(i) emailing purchased, rented, or borrowed lists;   
(ii) email appending and/or sending non-permission based email where prohibited (for example, in violation of the consent requirements outlined in Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) and the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), among others);   
(iii) engaging with email recipients or content lists that are likely to result in an excessive number of unsubscribe requests or Spam complaints or notices, as determined by acceptable industry practices.  

### 3.  **Email Opt-out Requirements** 

You warrant that each email you send or is sent for you using the HubSpot Service will contain:

a. header information that is not false or misleading; and

b. an advisement that the recipient may unsubscribe, opt-out or otherwise demand that use of its information for unsolicited, impermissible and/or inappropriate communication(s) as described in this AUP be stopped (and how the recipient can notify you that it wants to unsubscribe, opt-out, or stop this use of its information). 

These requirements may not apply if the email sent is a transactional email and these requirements are not otherwise required by law. You warrant that you will promptly comply with all opt-out, unsubscribe, "do not call" and "do not send" requests.

### 4.  **Telephone, Texting, and Messaging**

If you use the HubSpot Subscription Service to place telephone calls, text messages, or other supported messaging, you must comply with all applicable (i) laws relating to telephone calling, texting, and any other message marketing, including applicable local, state, national or international laws (e.g., the CAN-SPAM Act, TRAI, TCPA or other similar laws and regulations applicable to you); (ii) laws related to the recording of phone calls and ensure all proper consent to record is obtained prior to making any such recording; (iii) policies and guidelines of third party service providers, such as network operators and carriers; and (iv) industry standards, including those applicable guidelines published by the CTIA and the Mobile Marketing Association.  

You are prohibited from using or permitting access to use the HubSpot Subscription Service to make emergency calls or to provide or seek emergency services.

You are solely responsible for any penalties or fines incurred as a result of your non-compliance with third party service providers’ policies and guidelines. In addition to the other termination and suspension rights in this AUP, HubSpot may suspend or terminate your access to the Telephone and Texting services if (i) HubSpot receives repetitive complaints from your recipients or third party service providers; or (ii) HubSpot receives an instruction from a third party service provider to suspend or terminate your access to the service.

### 5. **No Disruption**

You agree not to:

a. use the HubSpot Service in a way that impacts the normal operation, privacy, integrity or security of another's property.  Another’s property includes another’s account(s), domain name(s), URL(s), website(s), network(s), system(s), facilities, equipment, data, other information, or business operations;

b. use or launch any automated system, including, "robots," "spiders," or "offline readers," that sends more request messages to our servers in a given period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional browser (also for example, scraping or harvesting);

c. use the Subscription Service in any manner that damages, disables, overburdens, or impairs any of our websites or interferes with any other party's use of the Subscription Service;

d. attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Subscription Service; 

e. access the Subscription Service using another User's unique login credentials, including reusing or sharing unique login credentials among multiple users;

f. allow any Users to access the HubSpot Service from an embargoed country, or allow access to the HubSpot Service to anyone included in the U.S. Commerce Department's Denied Persons List, Entry List, the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals, or other similarly sanctioned individuals;

g. access the Subscription Service other than through our interface; 

h. use the HubSpot Service to gain unauthorized access to, use, monitor, make an unauthorized reference to, another’s property, unless you have the appropriate express prior consent to do so; or

i. use the HubSpot Service in a way that causes or may cause any HubSpot IP addresses, HubSpot domains, or HubSpot customer domains to be blacklisted. 

Examples of prohibited actions include (without limitation) include hacking, spoofing, denial of service, mailbombing and/or sending any email that contains or transmits any virus or propagating worm(s), or any malware, whether spyware, adware or other such file or program.  

These restrictions apply regardless of your intent and whether or not you act intentionally or unintentionally.

### 6. **Proper Usage of the HubSpot Service**

You will respect the limits that apply to your use of the HubSpot Service as specified in the Product and Services Catalog available at [http://legal.hubspot.com/hubspot-product-and-services-catalog](https://legal.hubspot.com/hubspot-product-and-services-catalog) (the “Service Limits”). We may update or change these Service Limits by updating [http://legal.hubspot.com/hubspot-product-and-services-catalog](https://legal.hubspot.com/hubspot-product-and-services-catalog), so we encourage you to review this page periodically.

If you store any information belonging to a sensitive category of information under applicable law relating to privacy or data protection, you must adhere to the standards and obligations reflected in the HubSpot Sensitive Data Terms available at [https://legal.hubspot.com/sensitive-data-terms](https://legal.hubspot.com/sensitive-data-terms).  For the avoidance of doubt, you may not (directly or indirectly) use the HubSpot Service in a way that i) uses Permitted Sensitive Data in a service or feature not expressly permitted by HubSpot Sensitive Data Terms, ii) includes any Prohibited Sensitive Data, iii) otherwise stores or uses Permitted Sensitive Data in an unprotected manner or in violation of applicable regulation.  

In addition, and without limiting the other requirements in this AUP, you may not (directly or indirectly) use the HubSpot Service with content, or in a manner that:

* harvests or otherwise collects information about others, including e-mail addresses, without their consent;
* violates the usage standards or rules of an entity affected by your use, including without limitation any ISP, ESP, or news or user group (and including by way of example and not limitation circumventing or exceeding equipment use rights and restrictions and/or location and path identification detail);
* is legally actionable between private parties;
* is not a good faith use of the service, such as uploading Contacts in excess of your Contact tier, emailing those Contacts and then purging them shortly thereafter; and/or
* is in violation of any applicable local, state, national or international law or regulation, including all export laws and regulations and without limitation the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act (CAN-SPAM Act) (15 U.S.C. § 7701 et seq.), the U.S Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (47 U.S.C. § 227), the Do-Not-Call Implementation Act of 2003 (15 U.S.C. § 6152 et seq.; originally codified at § 6101 note), the General Data Protection Regulation (2016/679), the Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and Council of 8 June 2000, on certain legal aspects of information society services, in particular, electronic commerce in the Internal Market ('Directive on Electronic Commerce'), along with the Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and Council of 12 July 2002, concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector ('Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications'), regulations promulgated by the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission, any rules of national or other securities exchange, including without limitation, the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) (S.C. 2000, c. 5), Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) (S.C. 2010, c. 23), Japan’s Act on Regulation of Transmission of Specified Electronic Mail (Act No. 26 of April 17, 2002) and any regulations having the force of law or laws in force in your or your email recipient's country of residence;
* encourages, promotes, facilitates or instructs others to engage in illegal activity;
* promotes, encourages, or facilitates: hate speech, violence, discrimination based on race, color, sexual orientation, marital status, gender or identity expression, parental status, religion or creed, national origin or ancestry, sex, age, physical or mental disability, veteran status, genetic information, citizenship and/or any other characteristic protected by law. 

Organizations or individuals who promote, encourage, or facilitate hate speech, violence, discrimination, either through their own content or through distribution of user generated content, are prohibited from using the HubSpot Service, regardless of whether the HubSpot Service is used specifically for the prohibited activities. Violation of these standards may result in termination of your use of the HubSpot Service.

You are responsible for moderating user generated content or user activity on your platform or service. User generated content that violates these standards may result in termination of your use of the HubSpot Service.

### 7. **Restricted Industries**
