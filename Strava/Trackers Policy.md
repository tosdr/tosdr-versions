=============

Effective Date: December 12, 2023

Set your cookies preferences
----------------------------

We use Non-Essential Third-Party Cookies to improve your experience, perform analytics, and serve relevant ads. Please select your Non-Essential Third-Party Cookies preferences below. If you click “Accept” we will use Non-Essential Third-Party Cookies. If you click “Deny,” we will not use Non-Essential Third-Party Cookies. You can change this preference at any time.

What is a cookie?
-----------------

A cookie is a piece of data that may be stored in the browser you use to access Strava, which enables features and functionality. It allows our website to “remember” your activity or preferences over a length of time or during a particular session. If you're signed in to Strava, cookies allow us to show you the right information and personalize your experience.

Some of the cookies we use are set by us (strava.com) to facilitate our provision of the service. These are known as First Party Cookies. We also utilize Third-Party Cookies, which are set by other sites (for example, google.com) and employed on our website, and are explained further below.

How does Strava use cookies?
----------------------------

We use session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies are temporary cookies that are not stored in your browser beyond the session in question. They are used for authentication and security purposes and to ensure the effective and necessary functioning of the Strava features which you are utilizing. We may also use a session cookie to remember your preferences when viewing the site. These session cookies are erased when you exit your browser.

Persistent cookies are those placed on your browser for a pre-determined length of time when you visit this site. They expire on a set expiration date, or when they are deleted manually. To learn more about how you can delete cookies manually, read the section below entitled “Managing and refusing the use of cookies.”

First-Party Cookies
-------------------

We develop and use cookies via our website to authenticate users, block malicious use of login credentials and shield unauthorized access to member data. We also develop and use cookies to collect information on website and app usage in order to understand and improve Strava. These cookies also help us learn how well our website and app operate across different locations and identify any issues in the operation and provision of our products.

Third-Party Cookies
-------------------

We also permit the setting of Third-Party Cookies on our website. Some of these cookies are necessary to provide you with services you have requested (“Essential Third-Party Cookies”), whereas others are not necessary to provide you with services you have requested (“Non-Essential Third-Party Cookies”).

### _Essential Third-Party Cookies_

We use Essential Third-Party Cookies to allow you to navigate our site and use its services and features. For example, we allow you to sign up and log in using accounts you create with third-party products and services, such as Facebook, Google, or Apple (collectively, “Third-Party Accounts”). When you sign up or log in using Third-Party Accounts, we use Essential Third-Party Cookies which are necessary to authenticate you.

### _Non-Essential Third Party Cookies_

We use Non-Essential Third-Party Cookies to assist us in measuring and understanding how our products are used and how they can be optimized. We may also receive other analytics information from these third parties.

Some of these cookies are advertising cookies, which we employ to serve relevant ads to users who have already visited our website. We use the following cookies for advertising purposes: Meta Pixel, Google Ads, Snap and Branch.

Other cookies are used to assess performance and analytics, or to perform business research. We use the following cookies for performance, analytics and research purposes: Meta Pixel, Google Analytics, Snap and Branch.

Managing and refusing the use of cookies
----------------------------------------

When you first visit our site, you will see a banner asking whether you would like to accept the use of cookies. By clicking “I accept,” you agree to the use of all cookies as described here, including Non-Essential Third-Party Cookies.

We will only use Non-Essential Third-Party Cookies if you click “I accept” on the cookies banner, or in your cookies preferences. You can manage your cookies preferences at any time by toggling the radio button at the top of this policy. If you click “deny” in your cookies preferences or on the cookies banner, we will not use Non-Essential Third-Party Cookies.

Most browsers allow you to choose whether you wish to accept cookies. Different browsers make different controls available to you and so we provide links below to popular browser instructions on how you can do this. Generally, your browser will offer you the choice to accept, refuse or delete all cookies, or third-party cookies on a website, or those from specific websites. However, if you restrict our capability to set cookies, you may limit the full functionality of Strava, which will make some of our services and features unavailable to you.

Do Not Track (DNT)
------------------

We may not recognize Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) signals from your web browsers or device. This is because there is not yet a universally accepted standard on how to interpret and respond to DNT signals, which often conflict with other settings. If and when a standard is established, we will re-examine how we can appropriately respond to DNT signals.

Changes to this policy
----------------------

This policy may change from time to time, so it should be reviewed frequently for the most up to date cookie information. We will notify you of any changes by updates to this page.

If you have questions about this policy, you may reach us at DPO@strava.com.
