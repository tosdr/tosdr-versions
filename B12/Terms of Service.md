7. Payments and Billing.

a. Paid Services. Certain of our Services are or may in the future become subject to

payments (the “Paid Services”). Please see our Paid Services page

(https://www.b12.io/pricing) for a description of the currently available Paid Services and

to sign up for Paid Services. Please note that any payment terms presented by B12 to you

in the process of using or signing up for a Paid Service are deemed part of these Terms of

Services. All amounts are stated in, and shall be paid in, U.S. dollars. B12 does not

transmit invoices automatically, but they can be provided in PDF format from our billing

department upon your request to billing@b12.io.

b. Payment; Late Fees. By signing up to receive any Paid Services, you agree to pay B12,

in accordance with all applicable payment terms set forth on B12’s Paid Services page

and herein, the Fees for such Paid Services, and you authorize B12, through the Payment

Processor (defined below), to charge your chosen payment provider (“Payment Method”)

for the applicable Fees and agree to make payment using that selected Payment Method.

Unpaid invoices are subject to a finance charge of 1.5% per month on any outstanding

balance, or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is lower, plus all expenses of

collection (including, without limitation, reasonable attorney’s fees). If our collection

efforts fail, unpaid debts will be reported to all available credit reporting agencies. Any

account that is 15 days past due is subject to suspension of the Services. Any account that

is 30 or more days past due may be terminated.

c. Taxes. Fees are exclusive of any taxes. You shall be responsible for all taxes, tariffs,

levies and duties associated with the Services other than U.S. taxes based on B12’s net

income.

d. Billing. B12 uses a third party payment processor (the “Payment Processor”) to bill you

through a payment account linked to your Account on the Services (your “Billing

Account”) for use of the Paid Services. The processing of payments will be subject to the

terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor in addition to these

Terms of Service. B12 is not responsible for the acts, omissions or errors by the Payment

Processor but B12 reserves the right to correct any errors or mistakes that the Payment

Processor makes, even if the Payment Processor has already requested or received

payment. The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be

determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or

other provider of your chosen Payment Method. If B12, through the Payment Processor,

does not receive payment from you, you agree to pay all amounts due on your Billing

Account upon demand.

e. Auto Renewal. Fees for Paid Services ordered on a subscription or auto-renewing basis

will be automatically charged their agreed upon subscription amount on the agreed upon

schedule. When signing up for a Paid Service, you will be able to select a recurring

billing level and renewal term (“Subscription”). Unless you cancel or change your

Subscription in accordance with these Terms of Service, any Subscription you have

signed up for will be automatically extended for successive renewal periods of the same

duration as you selected, at the then current non-promotional rate. By signing up for a

Subscription, you agree that B12 may submit the charges associated with such

Subscription for payment on the applicable schedule and you will be responsible for such

charges. Your charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise

described when you select to use the Subscription. BY SIGNING UP FOR A

SUBSCRIPTION YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT B12 MAY SUBMIT

PERIODIC CHARGES (E.G., MONTHLY) WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION

FROM YOU, UNTIL YOU PROVIDE PRIOR NOTICE (RECEIPT OF WHICH IS

CONFIRMED BY B12) THAT YOU HAVE TERMINATED THIS AUTHORIZATION

OR WISH TO CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD. SUCH NOTICE WILL NOT

AFFECT CHARGES SUBMITTED BEFORE B12 REASONABLY COULD ACT. TO

TERMINATE OR ALTER YOUR SUBSCRIPTION PLEASE CONTACT OUR

SUPPORT TEAM AT HELLO@B12.IO. This does not waive our right to seek payment

directly from you.

f. Current Information Required. YOU MUST PROVIDE CURRENT, COMPLETE

AND ACCURATE INFORMATION FOR YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT. YOU MUST

PROMPTLY UPDATE ALL INFORMATION TO KEEP YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT

CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE (SUCH AS A CHANGE IN BILLING

ADDRESS, CREDIT CARD NUMBER, OR CREDIT CARD EXPIRATION DATE),

AND YOU MUST PROMPTLY NOTIFY B12 OR OUR PAYMENT PROCESSOR IF

YOUR PAYMENT METHOD IS MODIFIED OR CANCELED (E.G., FOR LOSS OR

THEFT) OR IF YOU BECOME AWARE OF A POTENTIAL BREACH OF

SECURITY, SUCH AS THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR USE OF YOUR

ACCOUNT CREDENTIALS OR PASSWORD. CHANGES TO SUCH

INFORMATION CAN BE MADE AT HTTPS://B12.IO/ACCOUNTS/SETTINGS. IF

YOU FAIL TO PROVIDE ANY OF THE FOREGOING INFORMATION, YOU

AGREE THAT B12 MAY CONTINUE CHARGING YOU FOR ANY USE OF PAID

SERVICES UNDER YOUR BILLING ACCOUNT UNLESS YOU HAVE

TERMINATED YOUR PAID SERVICES AS SET FORTH ABOVE.

g. Cancelling or Changing Paid Services. To change or cancel your Paid Services at any

time, contact B12 at hello@b12.io. Any request for cancellation must be sent at least ten

(10) business days prior to the end of the Subscription term to allow for adequate

processing time. Your nontermination or continued use of the relevant Paid Service

reaffirms that B12 is authorized to charge your Payment Method the Fees for such Paid

Service, including any associated fees (e.g. overage fees or late fees, to the extent

applicable). If you terminate a Subscription, you may use the applicable Paid Service

until the end of your then current Subscription term; however, your Subscription, and

therefore access to the Paid Services, will not be renewed after your then current

Subscription term expires. You will not be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of

any Fees paid for the then current Subscription period.

h. Change in Amount Authorized. If the amount to be charged to your Billing Account

varies from the amount you preauthorized (other than due to the imposition or change in

the amount of state sales taxes), you have the right to receive, and B12 shall provide,

notice of the amount to be charged and the date of the charge before the scheduled date of

the transaction. Any agreement you have with your payment provider will govern your

use of your Payment Method. You agree that B12 may accumulate charges incurred and

submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each billing cycle.

i. No Refunds. Payment obligations are noncancelable. Except as expressly set forth in

these Terms of Service, B12 will not, under any circumstances, issue refunds or prorate

any Fees for early cancellation or termination of the Services, or for any other reason.

j. Chargeback Policy; Disputes. If you have a question about charges made to your

Account, please contact B12 immediately at hello@b12.io. If the charges were made in

error, B12 will credit your Billing Account or Payment Method for the appropriate

amount. Please note that B12 has a zero tolerance policy for chargebacks. Any customer

who disputes a credit card payment that is found to be valid may be permanently banned

by B12 from use of any and all B12 Services.

claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of

executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his

settlement with the debtor”.

ARBITRATION CLAUSE \& CLASS ACTION WAIVER – IMPORTANT – PLEASE REVIEW

AS THIS AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS



13. Arbitration.

a. ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND B12 (WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DISPUTE

INVOLVES A THIRD PARTY) WITH REGARD TO YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH

B12, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DISPUTES RELATED TO THESE

TERMS OF SERVICE, YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, AND/OR RIGHTS OF

PRIVACY AND/OR PUBLICITY, WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING,

INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION IN NEW YORK, NEW YORK UNDER THE

STREAMLINED ARBITRATION RULES AND PROCEDURES (“RULES”) OF

JAMS, INC. (“JAMS”) THEN IN EFFECT, BY ONE COMMERCIAL ARBITRATOR

WITH SUBSTANTIAL EXPERIENCE IN RESOLVING INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY AND COMMERCIAL CONTRACT DISPUTES, WHO SHALL BE

SELECTED FROM THE APPROPRIATE LIST OF JAMS ARBITRATORS IN

ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH RULES, AND YOU AND B12 HEREBY EXPRESSLY

WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY. DISCOVERY AND RIGHTS TO APPEAL IN

ARBITRATION ARE GENERALLY MORE LIMITED THAN IN A LAWSUIT, AND

OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU AND B12 WOULD HAVE IN COURT MAY NOT BE

AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.

b. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local “small claims” court, if

permitted by that small claims court’s rules and if within such court’s jurisdiction, unless

such action is transferred, removed or appealed to a different court. You may bring

claims only on your own behalf. Neither you nor B12 will participate in a class action or

classwide arbitration for any claims covered by this agreement. YOU ARE GIVING UP

YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS

MEMBER ON ANY CLASS CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST B12 INCLUDING

ANY RIGHT TO CLASS ARBITRATION OR ANY CONSOLIDATION OF

INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS. You also agree not to participate in claims brought in a

private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving

another person's account, if B12 is a party to the proceeding. This dispute resolution

provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and not by any state law

concerning arbitration. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered

in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law

notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or

awards that conflict with these Terms of Service. You agree that regardless of any statute

or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of, related to or connected

with the use of the Services or these Terms of Services must be filed within one (1) year

after such claim of action arose or be forever banned.

c. Severability. If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of

third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding

language in this Arbitration section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will

survive the termination of your relationship with B12.

14. Governing Law and Jurisdiction.

These Terms of Service shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws

of the State of New York, including its conflicts of law rules, and the United States of

America. You agree that, subject to Section 13, any dispute arising from or relating to the

subject matter of these Terms of Service shall be resolved in New York County, New

York.



15. Modification.

B12 reserves the right, in our sole discretion, to modify or replace any of these Terms of

Service, or change, suspend, or discontinue the Services (including without limitation, the

availability of any feature, database, or content) at any time by posting a notice on the

Site or by sending you notice through the Services, via email or by another appropriate

means of electronic communication. B12 may also impose limits on certain features and

services or restrict your access to parts or all of the Services without notice or liability.

While B12 will provide timely notice of modifications, it is also your responsibility to

check these Terms of Service periodically for changes. Your continued use of the

Services following notification of any changes to these Terms of Service constitutes

acceptance of those changes, which will apply to your continued use of the Services

going forward. Your use of the Services is subject to the Terms of Service in effect at the

time of such use.



16. Miscellaneous.

Entire Agreement and Severability. These Terms of Service are the entire agreement

between you and B12 with respect to the Services, including use of the Website, and

supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral,

written or electronic) between you and B12 with respect to the Services. If any provision

of these Terms of Service is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be

limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms of Service will

otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. The failure of either party to

exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any

further rights hereunder



17. Force Majeure.

B12 shall not be liable for any failure to perform our obligations hereunder where such

failure results from any cause beyond our reasonable control, including, without

limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation, fire, flood,

governmental acts or orders or restrictions, recognized health threats as determined by the

World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control, or local government

authority or health agencies (including but not limited to the health threats of COVID-19,

H1N1, or similar infectious diseases), curtailment of transportation facilities and the

failure of suppliers.
