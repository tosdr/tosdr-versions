as described in this Privacy Policy.



What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?



This Privacy Policy covers the treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) gathered when you

are using or accessing the Services. This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any Personal Information that our

business partners share with us or that we share with our business partners.



This Privacy Policy does not apply to websites that we develop or maintain on behalf of our clients, as our clients have sole

control over the privacy policies maintained on such websites nor does it apply to the practices of any other third parties

that we do not own or control, including but not limited to any third party websites, plug-ins, services and applications

(“Third Party Services”) that you elect to access through the Services or to individuals that we do not manage or employ.

While we attempt to facilitate access only to those Third Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot

take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party Services. We encourage you to carefully review

the privacy policies of any Third Party Services you access.



What Information Do We Collect?



The information we gather enables us to improve and continue to operate the Services. In connection with certain aspects of

the Services, we may request, collect and/or display some of your Personal Information. We collect the following types of

information from our users.



Account Information:



When you create an Account, you will provide information that could be Personal Information, such as your username,

password and email address. You acknowledge that this information may be personal to you, and by creating an account on

the Services and providing Personal Information to us, you allow others, including us, to identify you and therefore may not

be anonymous. We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services. You may unsubscribe

from these messages through your Account settings, although we, regardless, reserve the right to contact you when we

believe it is necessary, such as for account recovery purposes.



Financial Information:



We do not currently collect financial information, such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration

date or other financial information); that information is collected and stored by our third party payment processing

company (the “Payment Processor”), and use and storage of that information is governed by the Payment Processor’s

applicable terms of service and privacy policy.



User Content:



Some features of the Services may now or in the future allow you to provide content to the Services, such as written

comments. All content submitted by you to the Services may be retained by us indefinitely, even after you terminate your

account. We may continue to disclose such content to third parties in a manner that does not reveal Personal Information, as

described in this Privacy Policy.



IP Address Information and Other Information Collected Automatically:

GDSVF\&H\2457598.3 2



• We may automatically receive and record information from your web browser when you interact with the Services,

including your IP address and cookie information. This information is used for fighting spam/malware and also to

facilitate collection of data concerning your interaction with the Services (e.g., what links you have clicked on).



• Generally, the Services may automatically collect usage information, such as the number and frequency of visitors to

the Websites. We may use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, but not in a manner that would

identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us and third parties authorized by us to figure out how

often individuals use parts of the Services so that we can analyze and improve them.



Email Communications:



We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. We use this confirmation to improve our customer

service.



Information Collected Using Cookies:



• Cookies are pieces of text that may be provided to your computer through your web browser when you access a

website. Your browser stores cookies in a manner associated with each website you visit. We use cookies to enable our

servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you visit the Websites and otherwise use the Services.



• Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information

collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are. As noted, however, we do use

cookies to identify that your web browser has accessed aspects of the Services and may associate that information with

your Account if you have one.



• Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new

cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of

each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave cookies active, because they enable you

to take advantage of the most attractive features of the Services.



• This Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties. We do not

control when or how third parties place cookies on your computer. For example, third party websites to which a link

points may set cookies on your computer.



Information Related to Advertising and the Use of Web Beacons:



To support and enhance the Services, we may serve advertisements, and also allow third parties to serve advertisements,

through the Services. These advertisements are sometimes targeted and served to particular users and may come from third

party companies called “ad networks.” Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and

research firms.



Advertisements may be targeted to users who fit a certain general profile category and may be based on anonymized

information inferred from information provided to us by a user, including Personal Information (e.g., gender or age), may

be based on the Services usage patterns of particular users, or may be based on your activity on Third Party Services. We

do not provide Personal Information to any ad networks for use outside of the Services.



To increase the effectiveness of ad delivery, we may deliver a file (known as a “web beacon”) from an ad network to you

through the Services. Web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research and reporting

for us and for advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit

other websites. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network’s

servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.



Aggregate Information:



We collect statistical information about how both unregistered and registered users, collectively, use the Services

(“Aggregate Information”). Some of this information is derived from Personal Information. This statistical information is

not Personal Information and cannot be tied back to you, your Account or your web browser.

online activity through its own tracking technologies and subject to its own privacy policy. Last, when you use these tools,

encourage you to read the privacy policies and other policies of the social networks and other Third Party Services you use
