Getaround car rental
--------------------

Rent the perfect vehicle with Getaround car rental services There are a thousand reasons why you may need a rental car. Maybe you‚Äôre moving and need a [cargo van](https://getaround.com/search?category=cargo_van) to move your furniture across town. Perhaps you‚Äôre going on a romantic getaway with your partner and want to rent a [convertible](https://getaround.com/) to cruise around in. Or maybe you‚Äôre going on a business trip and need a luxury rental car to impress your clients! No matter what your needs are, Getaround is the perfect car rental option.

### Why you should choose Getaround car rental

Getaround car sharing is an [environmentally friendly](https://getaround.com/blog/the-impact-of-car-sharing/), convenient, and affordable alternative to traditional car rental. When you rent a car with Getaround, you‚Äôre actively choosing to share an individual owner‚Äôs car when they wouldn‚Äôt be driving it anyway. That helps keep new cars off the road, giving the environment a tiny break it desperately needs.  

Getaround cars are conveniently located across communities, at airports, and in cities around the world. That means [car-sharing guests](https://getaround.com/privacy/) benefit from having affordable and convenient access to nearby rental cars. But there‚Äôs more! Getaround car rental is super flexible. You can rent a car by the hour or by the day. And, if your plans change, no big deal! You can cancel within 1 hour of booking or more than 24 hours before the start of your trip for free.

### How does Getaround car rental work?

Renting a car with Getaround is as easy as one, two, three.  

1)* Download the free Getaround app to your smartphone. Search for the vehicle you‚Äôd like to rent based on location and duration (by the hour or day‚Ä¶), and book the vehicle that best meets your needs.
2)* Start driving! The Getaround app turns your smartphone into a car key. You can unlock the car directly from the app, meaning you have full flexibility to get the car any time after your rental pickup time.

  
The convenience of a Getaround rental car can‚Äôt be beat. Why not give it a shot?

### Types of cars you can rent with Getaround

Getaround offers a huge array of [fleet styles](https://getaround.com/) including trucks, vans, cars, convertibles, SUVs, and so much more. The variety of sizes, styles, colors, models, and makes is as large as the community or area where you‚Äôre renting a car. When you search for a car to book on the Getaround app or website, you can filter by your needs.  

In our category filter, you can choose the type of vehicle you need: SUV/Jeep? Coupe/Sedan? Minivan? Pickup truck? The car rental options are endless. In our class filter, you can choose between economy, luxury, and performance. And guess what? You can even filter by transmission (automatic or manual) and by drivetrain (all-wheel drive, anyone?). But it doesn‚Äôt end there! You can even filter by special features. If you‚Äôre going on a ski trip and need a roof rack, you can search specifically for that. Pet-friendly cars, cars with bike racks, and cars with Bluetooth‚Ä¶ You can request whatever you need from your Getaround rental car.  

Whether you‚Äôre [going on a road trip with friends](https://getaround.com/blog/road-tripping-with-getaround/) or taking a weekend getaway, Getaround car rental meets all your vehicle rental needs.
