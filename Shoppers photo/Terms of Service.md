SHOPPERS/PHARMAPRIX PHOTO TERMS OF USE
--------------------------------------

  
  
  
  
**SITE TERMS OF USE**  
  
**Last Updated: July 23, 2020**  
  
**WELCOME**

Loblaw Companies Limited and/or a Loblaw Companies Limited subsidiary (individually and collectively, "Loblaw") is pleased to provide this mobile application or website (individually and collectively, the “Application”) to its users (“you”) for personal, non-commercial use. By installing, accessing or using the Application, you agree unconditionally and without any reservation to be legally bound by all the terms set out below (“Terms of Use”), and to comply with all applicable laws and regulations.

If you do not accept and agree to be legally bound by and comply with the Terms of Use, please do not access or use the Application.

In the event that any Loblaw subsidiary website contains terms and conditions for the use of that website which conflict with or are inconsistent with the Terms of Use, those terms and conditions for use of that website will prevail and govern to the extent of the conflict or inconsistency in connection with the use of that website.

**UPDATES TO THE TERMS OF USE**

We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify all or a portion of the Terms of Use at any time without further notice and without incurring any liability or obligation. If we do this, we will post the changes to the Terms of Use on the Application by indicating at the top of this page the date on which the Terms of Use were last revised and are effective. Your continued access to and/or use of the Application after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of, and agreement to be legally bound by, the Terms of Use as revised. It is your sole responsibility to regularly check the Application to determine if there have been any changes to the Terms of Use and to review such changes.

**ONLINE PURCHASES**

For information relating to purchases made from the Application, please refer to the Price List, Help Centre and Photo Terms and Conditions. By using the Application and making purchases from the Application, you signify that you have read, fully understand and agree to be legally bound by the Terms of Use, the shipping & handling information and the returns & exchanges policy.

Not all stores carry the complete range of our products. Also, some of our products are available for a seasonal or limited time only.

The prices shown on the Application may differ from those for purchases made through other channels. Any shipping and applicable taxes will be calculated and displayed when completing checkout and prior to submission of your order. Although we make our best effort to ensure pricing is accurately reflected for each item on the Application, it is always possible that some of the products listed on the Application may be incorrectly priced. In those circumstances, we reserve the right to apply the correct current price to the item at checkout. If you are not satisfied with the current price, you have the right to remove the product from your order.

You have a legal obligation to pay for any orders indicated to be made by you. You may only place an online order if you are over the age of majority in the province or territory where you reside.

**FEATURES OF THE APPLICATION AND SECURITY**

We take great pride in the Application, and every effort has been made to help ensure that the information contained on the Application is correct. Unfortunately, however, there may sometimes be information on the Application that contains typographical errors, inaccuracies, or omissions – including those that may relate to product descriptions, pricing, promotions, offers, and/or availability. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we reserve the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions and to change or update information or modify or cancel orders if any information on the Application is inaccurate at any time without prior notice (including after you have submitted your order).

Your safe and secure online shopping experience is our top priority. As such, we routinely monitor the Application for suspicious activity. However, the transmission of data or information over the internet or other forms of networks may not be secure, and is subject to possible loss, interception or alteration while in transit. We do not assume any liability for any damage you may experience or costs you may incur as a result of any electronic transmissions over the internet or otherwise on or within the Application, such as transmissions involving the exchange of electronic messages of any kind (including those which may contain your personal information). In no event will the information you provide on or through the Application be deemed to be confidential, create any fiduciary obligations to you on our part, or result in any liability to you on our part in the event that such information is inadvertently released by us or accessed by third parties without your consent.

**DISCONTINUANCE OR MODIFICATION OF THE APPLICATION**

You acknowledge and agree that we reserve the right at any time to modify or discontinue the whole, or any part of the Application, including any products offered thereon, without notice, and that we will not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, to you or any other person or entity for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of any such modification(s) or discontinuance.

**PRIVACY**

Without limiting the generality of these Terms of Use, your use of the Application is also subject to the terms of our Privacy Policy, which is hereby incorporated into and made part of this document. Please carefully review our [Privacy Policy](https://www.loblaw.ca/en/privacy.html). By using the Application, you signify that you have read, fully understand and agree to be legally bound by our [Privacy Policy](https://www.loblaw.ca/en/privacy.html).
