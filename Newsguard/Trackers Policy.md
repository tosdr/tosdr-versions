Cookie Notice
=============

_Last Updated: October 17, 2019_

Like most businesses, NewsGuard Technologies, Inc. (“NewsGuard”, “we”, “us” or “our”)  employs cookies and similar technologies.

This Cookie Notice tells you about our use of cookies and similar technologies on our browser extension and website [www.newsguardtech.com](http://www.newsguardtech.com/) (together our “Services”).  For further information about how we use, store, disclose and process personal information that we obtain through or in connection with the use of our Services, please visit our Privacy Policy. 

When you first access our website from certain jurisdictions, you will receive a message advising you that cookies and similar technologies are in use.  By clicking “**accept**”, you signify that you understand and agree to the use of these technologies, as described in this Cookie Notice.

You do not have to accept cookies and consent can be withdrawn at any time (See ‘How to Control Cookies’, below). You can change your browser or device settings to refuse or restrict cookies, and you may delete them after they have been placed on your device at any time.

**1\. What are cookies?**

Cookies are small files containing a string of characters which we may store on your computer or mobile device when you visit our Services.  When you visit our Services, the cookies allow us to recognize your browser. Cookies may store your preferences and other information but cannot read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites.

Cookies set by a website owner (in this case, NewsGuard) are called “**first party cookies**”. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner (e.g. Google) are called “**third party cookies**”.  Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the Services (e.g. analytics).

**2. The Cookies We Use**

The information that we collect with cookies allows us to statistically analyze usage of our Services, and to improve and customize our content and other offerings. However, we only disclose information collected with cookies to third parties on an aggregated basis without the use of any information that personally identifies you. 

The specific types of first party and third party cookies placed by our Services and the purposes they perform are described in the table below:

They can be deleted or blocked using your browser settings, however (see Section 3, How to Control Cookies, below). |
| **Performance and Functionality Cookies** These are used to recognize you when you return to our website. This enables us to personalize our content for you and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region), but are non-essential to the performance of the website. | NewsGuard | These cookies can be deleted or blocked using your browser settings (see Section 3, How to Control Cookies, below). |
| **Analytical Cookies** These cookies collect information about how users access and move through the Services. These cookies also collect geolocation information (this is limited to the region from which you access our website or use our browser extension) and information about the computer, mobile device or other device you use to access the Services, such as web browser type, language and version, screen size and other transactional information. We use this information in aggregate form to help us to improve the way our Services work. | Google Analytics | These cookies can be deleted or blocked using your browser settings (see Section 3, How to Control Cookies, below).
