When we provide you with services, we may share your personal data for several reasons which are detailed below. Whenever we share your personal data, we put safeguards in place which require these other organisations to keep your data safe and to ensure that they do not use your personal data for their own marketing purposes unless you have given us your consent to do so. We will never sell your personal data to a third party.

We may share your personal data in the following circumstances:

1. **To provide our services** – we work with a number of trusted service providers who carry out services on our behalf, such service providers include website and database hosting (Amazon Web Services) and our certificate provider, Trinity College.
2. **To comply with legal requests and prevent crime** - There may be scenarios where we are subject to a legal obligation to disclose or share your personal data, such as with law enforcement agencies, regulatory bodies or public authorities in order to prevent or detect crime. We will only ever disclose your personal data to these third parties to the extent we are required to do so by law.
3. **If our Group Structure changes** - We may also share your personal data if we choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business and/or group, or our assets in the future. Or we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. During any such process, we may share your data with other parties. We will only do this if they agree to keep your data safe.

9\. International Transfers
---------------------------

Your Personal Data may be processed outside of the UK, this is because some of the organisations we use to provide our service to you are based internationally.

We have taken appropriate steps to ensure that the Personal Data processed outside the UK has an essentially equivalent level of protection to that guaranteed in the UK.

We do this by ensuring that:

* Your Personal Data is only processed in a country which the Secretary of State has confirmed has an adequate level of protection (an adequacy regulation), or
* We enter into an International Data Transfer Agreement (“IDTA”) with the receiving organisation and adopt supplementary measures, where necessary.

10\. Your rights and how to complain

You have certain rights in relation to the processing of your Personal Data, including to:

* ##### Right to be informed
    
    You have the right to know what personal data we collect about you, how we use it, for what purpose and in accordance with which lawful basis, who we share it with and how long we keep it. We use our privacy notice to explain this.

### How to exercise your rights

If you wish to exercise your rights, you may contact us using the details set out below within the section called ‘How to contact us and our Data Protection Officer’. We may need to request specific information from you to confirm your identity before we can process your request.

11\. Children’s Privacy and Safeguarding
----------------------------------------

We understand the importance of ensuring children’s data is kept safe and do all we can to make sure it is not compromised. We have security measures and procedures in place should we become aware of any compromise to a child’s data and will inform relevant parties as needed and required under data protection legislation.

Rocksteady Music School has a statutory and moral duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of all children receiving education and training with us. More information can be found in our [Safeguarding Notice](https://www.rocksteadymusicschool.com/safeguarding-policy).

We record our band sessions in the form of video, audio, and photographic images. We do this for the following purposes:

* Showcasing your child’s educational experience with us as part of the service we provide
* Assisting with lesson planning and development
* Training

We don’t record every session or performance piece and where we record/photograph sessions for our ‘Backstage’ feature, consent is gathered from parents/guardians/carers.

Where schools have enrolled children via our bursary and funded schemes, we will not record/take photos unless direct consent has been provided to us from a parent/guardian/carer. Any consent withdrawals, concerns or complaints will be passed onto the school as necessary.

Our website utilises cookies and similar technologies. You can find out more by viewing our [cookie notice available here](https://www.rocksteadymusicschool.com/cookie-policy/).

14\. Security and storage of information
----------------------------------------

We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions, and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

If we become aware of any loss, misuse, alteration of personal data we will work closely with our IT team, Data Protection Officer (DPO) and other parties as necessary to investigate the incident at hand. We have put into place the relevant procedure and policies in place to investigate, mitigate and report (when needed to relevant parties) such instances.

15\. Data Retention
-------------------

We will not keep Personal Data longer than is necessary, for the purpose or purposes for which they were collected. Retention periods will vary according to the types of personal information we hold and for what purposes.
