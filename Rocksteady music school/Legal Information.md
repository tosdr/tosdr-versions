We will never sell your personal data to a third party.

We may share your personal data in the following circumstances:

1. **To provide our services** – we work with a number of trusted service providers who carry out services on our behalf, such service providers include website and database hosting (Amazon Web Services) and our certificate provider, Trinity College.
2. **To comply with legal requests and prevent crime** – There may be scenarios where we are subject to a legal obligation to disclose or share your personal data, such as with law enforcement agencies, regulatory bodies or public authorities in order to prevent or detect crime. We will only ever disclose your personal data to these third parties to the extent we are required to do so by law.
3. **If our Group Structure changes** – We may also share your personal data if we choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business and/or group, or our assets in the future.

9\. INTERNATIONAL  
TRANSFERS
-----------------------------

Your Personal Data may be processed outside of the UK, this is because some of the organisations we use to provide our service to you are based internationally.

We have taken appropriate steps to ensure that the Personal Data processed outside the UK has an essentially equivalent level of protection to that guaranteed in the UK.

We do this by ensuring that:

* Your Personal Data is only processed in a country which the Secretary of State has confirmed has an adequate level of protection (an adequacy regulation), or
* We enter into an International Data Transfer Agreement (“IDTA”) with the receiving organisation and adopt supplementary measures, where necessary.

10\. YOUR RIGHTS AND

AND SAFEGUARDING

We understand the importance of ensuring children’s data is kept safe and do all we can to make sure it is not compromised. We have security measures and procedures in place should we become aware of any compromise to a child’s data and will inform relevant parties as needed and required under data protection legislation.

* Training

We don’t record every session or performance piece and where we record/photograph sessions for our ‘Backstage’ feature, consent is gathered from parents/guardians/carers.

Where schools have enrolled children via our bursary and funded schemes, we will not record/take photos unless direct consent has been provided to us from a parent/guardian/carer. Any consent withdrawals, concerns or complaints will be passed onto the school as necessary.

They will only process your personal data on our instructions, and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

If we become aware of any loss, misuse, alteration of personal data we will work closely with our IT team, Data Protection Officer (DPO) and other parties as necessary to investigate the incident at hand. We have put into place the relevant procedure and policies in place to investigate, mitigate and report (when needed to relevant parties) such instances.
