**Privacy Policy For Worldchannel.org Visitors**
================================================

Thank you for visiting worldchannel.org. As an extension of our broadcast mission, we want your visit to worldchannel.org to enlighten, inform, and entertain you. We know you don't want the information you provide us shared indiscriminately. Here we explain what information World Channel and our third-party vendors acting on our behalf to help deliver the services and operate and analyze use of the Website), collect, what we do with the information, and what controls you have over the information collected.

We're committed to ensuring the privacy of your personally identifiable information (or personal data), and to protecting your ability to make financial transactions and transmit your personal data with full confidence. We will deal with your personal data in compliance with all current applicable data protection laws.

The privacy policy explains how we will process the data relating to you that you provide to us (or that we may collect) when you visit our website at worldchannel.org.

The Website is operated by the WGBH Educational Foundation (GBH), a nonprofit organization registered in the US commonwealth of Massachusetts with registered office at One Guest Street, Boston, MA 02135. Where we decide the purpose and means for the processing of the personal data that you provide or that we otherwise obtain about you, we are the “data controller”. As data controller, we will comply with all applicable data protection laws.

This privacy policy should be read together with our [Terms of Use](https://worldchannel.org/about/terms-use/). Please read these carefully, and if you have any questions or concerns, please [contact us.](https://worldchannel.org/about/contact-us/)

Our Website links to numerous other sites, such as PBS, NPR and Public Interactive, and may contain hyperlinks to other third party websites. These third party websites operate independently from us, and we cannot accept any responsibility or liability for the privacy practices of such third parties nor the availability of these external sites or resources.  The appearance of such links on our Website is not an endorsement.  Should you use any of these websites, such use is at your own risk and we would advise that you consult those websites to learn more about their policies.

1\. INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU& HOW WE USE IT

When you visit our Website or otherwise interact with us, we may collect and process information about you, which will take the form of either personally identifiable information (PII) (also called personal data in the UK) or non-personally identifiable information (Non-PII) (which amounts to anonymous data from which you cannot be identified). This privacy policy is concerned with our collection, use, storage and other processing of your personal data.

Personal data includes personal information such as your name, postal address, e-mail address, telephone number(s), credit card or bank account information and/or other identifying information. If you visit or use our Website, we may ask that you voluntarily supply some personal data, such as when you register for our website, make a donation, complete a survey, register for an online discussion, or enter a contest.

In addition to any personal data that you voluntarily provide to us, we may also collect personal data about you from others or by other means, such as via data analytics.

Support of WGBH:

On certain pages within the Website we may now or in the future offer visitors the opportunity to make a donation in support of World Channel or our programming. If you visit our site and choose to make a donation, we will collect and store personal data about you, which may include your telephone number, e-mail address, and billing address. We will ask for your credit card number to process your donation, but we do not store it.

Forums, Feedback Content Submissions and Social Media:

On certain pages within the website you can submit your own content (“User Generated Content”) to be published, make community postings, comments, suggestions, and vote. If you do so, we may collect your name, IP address, and e-mail addresses in connection with these activities along with any other personal data (including any sensitive personal data) that you may voluntarily share. We will indicate which information is required and which is optional. We may contact users regarding their submissions in certain circumstances. Before you submit any User Generated Content, you are advised to read our [Terms of Use](https://worldchannel.org/about/terms-use/), including the section relating to User Generated Content, so that you understand and comply with our rules and requirements.

Our Website also contains links to WGBH’s social media pages on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.  Should you visit those social media pages and choose to follow or connect with us on social media, we may receive personal information from the social media providers (depending on your social media privacy settings), including your name (and/or your social media unique user name), email and/or postal address, telephone number(s), IP address, gender and/or age and your general interests and preferences (e.g. Likes, Shares, Posts). We may use this information to find out more about our digital community so that we can better understand and serve our members and other visitors to our Website.

When you share your personal information on these social media sites, this may be shared with that social media provider which may then process that information to enable them to provide targeted marketing messages where you have indicated your agreement (for example, via your privacy settings) to receive these messages from them or where it is otherwise lawful to do so.

If we receive any personal information about you from these third party social media sites, we will only process your information for the purposes of direct marketing in accordance with laws relating to marketing directly to individuals, such as where you have provided your consent or where it is otherwise lawful for us to do so.

We may also process personal information collected via social media to improve our marketing, including the creation of custom audiences and lookalike audiences. This allows us to offer more relevant marketing to potential new customers and service users without using information that personally identifies you.

Your participation and contribution in our Recordings and Projects:

On occasion, we may inform visitors about upcoming projects including those for which we may be inviting individuals to become participants. If you contact us in relation to participating in a World Channel project, we will likely collect, use and store your contact details (such as email address or phone number used to contact us) as well as any other information that may be provided voluntarily at that time. We encourage public engagement and we will use our best endeavours to reply to all such requests that we receive.  If you are selected to become a participant in connection with any of World Channel’s projects, we will contact you directly to provide more detailed information about that opportunity and the use of participants’ contributions.

Your submission of others’ Personally Data:

On certain pages within the Website you can submit information about other people. For example, you may submit a person’s name and email address to send an article. If you do submit someone else’s personal data, it is your responsibility to ensure that you have that individual’s consent to do so. We cannot accept any responsibility or liability for this, and as such you do so at your own risk. This information will only be used for your intended purpose.

Contests, Sweepstakes, Surveys and Special Offers:

On occasion, we may collect personal information from our Website users in connection with optional sweepstakes, surveys, contests or special offers. We will indicate which information is required and which is optional. Such information will only be used and otherwise processed for the purposes indicated at the time of collection and where you have provided your consent or it is otherwise lawful for us to process this information.

E-Mail and E-mail Newsletters:

We offer several e-mail newsletters and emails.  For example, on our Website, visitors may subscribe to the Thread Newsletter in order to receive our e-mail and e-newsletter updates.  If you subscribe, we may collect personal information from you in connection with this optional, free e-mail and e-newsletter service, such as your name, e-mail address, telephone number(s) as well as your interests and preferences. We will indicate which information is required and which is optional. Such information will only be used for the purposes indicated at the time of collection.

If you have subscribed to or asked to be added to our mailing list, we will provide your details to our third party email service provider, [Iterable](https://iterable.com/trust/privacy-policy/), that helps us to produce and manage our e-mail updates and e-newsletters.

We will always provide a clear and convenient method of unsubscribing to our e-mailings. If you no longer wish to receive a specific newsletter, follow the “unsubscribe” instructions located in each newsletter or email, or by going to the Website's [Contact Us](https://worldchannel.org/about/contact-us/) page and send us a message. We will update our records as soon as possible.

Marketing and Promotional Communications:

On occasion, we may collect personal information from our Website users in connection with optional marketing and promotional communications from World Channel, PBS, or a public broadcasting station. If you opt in to receiving these communications, we will indicate which information is required and which is optional. Such information will only be used for the purposes indicated at the time of collection.

If at any time, you decide that you do not wish to receive promotional or other marketing material from us, then you can opt-out by clicking on the unsubscribe link in those e-mails or contacting us at [worldchannel@wgbh.org](mailto:worldchannel@wgbh.org "mailto:worldchannel@wgbh.org") at any time.

Data Analytics and Cookies In addition to information that you provide to us, as is common practice among web sites, our Website uses “cookies” and similar technologies.

5\. SECURITY OF INFORMATION

We will take commercially reasonable, appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk that could be encountered via the use of our Website and services, taking into account the likelihood and severity those risks might pose to the rights and freedoms of our Website visitors.

In particular, we will take precautions to protect against the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration, and unauthorised disclosure of or access to the personal information transmitted, stored or otherwise processed by us.

Credit card information provided on the Website is protected against unauthorized use by Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) security features. The SSL protocol is the industry standard method for creating an encrypted, secure connection between your web browser and a web server, such as the Website’s server.

Please be aware that, while we make the security of our Website and your personal information a high priority and devote considerable time and resources to maintain robust IT security, no security system can prevent all security breaches. You should, also, keep in mind that no Internet or e-mail transmission is ever fully secure or error free.  Additionally, because most e-mail is not encrypted, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail.  When you choose to share your personal information with us, you accept the aforesaid and provide your information at your own risk.

In such an event, please contact us through our [Contact Us](https://worldchannel.org/about/contact-us/) page at [https://worldchannel.org/about/contact-us/](https://worldchannel.org/about/contact-us/).

If you reside within the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or are providing your personal data from within the EEA, the personal data that we collect from you (or obtain about you) may be transferred to, and stored at, or accessed from a destination outside the EEA.  For example, it may be transferred to and processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers or third party service providers, many of whom may operate from multiple locations including non-EEA based operations or engage sub-processors located outside the EEA

Where such international transfers of personal data occur, we will ensure that appropriate safeguards are put in place that meet the requirements of application data protection laws, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016.

If you would like to find out more about these safeguards or if you have any other queries or comments in relation to this policy, please let us know by emailing us through our [Contact Us](https://worldchannel.org/about/contact-us/) page at [https://worldchannel.org/about/contact-us/](https://worldchannel.org/about/contact-us/).
