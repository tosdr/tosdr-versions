We take no responsibility for your exposure to content on the Website whether it violates our content policies or not. You understand that the information and opinions in content uploaded by third parties represent solely the thoughts of the author and is neither endorsed by nor does it necessarily reflect World Channel’s beliefs or editorial positions. You hereby release and waive any and all claims, causes of action and/or liability against World Channel arising from or in connection with your use of the Website, the Content and/or any other material on the Website. You also agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless World Channel and its trustees, officers and employees from and against any and all causes of action, claims or liability, including costs and attorneys’ fees, arising from or in connection with your use of the Website, your provision of User Generated Content to or on the Website, or failure to abide by applicable law or these Terms.

**DISCUSSION AND COMMENT POLICY**

This is the discussion policy for users of World Channel’s social networking tools. All participants offering comments on worldchannel.org are required to follow these guidelines. Those violating the following guidelines may have their comments removed or blocked.

Our guidelines are intended to facilitate a sense connection and sharing within the World Channel online community. You can contribute to and be part of our community by participating on wgbh.org with these guidelines in mind:

  
1\. Be respectful and civil. If polite language isn’t possible, please don’t post. Engage points, focus on ideas, debate, and discuss. Never resort to name-calling, slander, or obscenities. Messages that include anything World Channel determines to be hate speech, a threat, harassment, or anything illegal will be removed and the poster will be blocked.

  
2\. Post clear, concise comments (posts longer than 200 words tend to be ignored by readers anyway). Long posts may be edited by World Channel. Before submitting, take a moment to re-read your post for clarity, grammar, punctuation, and spelling. And please avoid typing in all caps; it's the online version of shouting.

  
3\. Stay with the topic at hand. Keeping your posts focused contributes to the best possible discussion.

  
4\. Write your own posts. A link or quote from another source can be a meaningful addition to the discussion; copying and pasting an entire article from elsewhere does not contribute in a meaningful way (also see guideline 2, above). In addition, it often violates the author’s copyright. Help keep the conversation lively and focused by posting only one link per comment.

  
5\. Promote the discussion, rather than your own interests. World Channel’s online community is not an appropriate venue for posters’ advertisements, promotions, campaigns, solicitations, or proselytizing. There can be a fine line between discussion and promotion of personal interests; use your best judgment and we’ll use ours.

  
All comments are moderated, and World Channel will not publish comments that don’t meet these guidelines. Our guidelines are adapted in part from NPR’s Guidelines for Commenting. Thanks for being part of World Channel’s community!
