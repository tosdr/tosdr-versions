The Avon Company Terms and Conditions of Use
============================================

Please read these Terms and Conditions of Use (the “Agreement”) carefully before using this website. This Agreement applies to all AVON websites, including, but not limited to, the following: AVON.COM. If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, please do not use any of the AVON WEBSITES. The Avon Company, a corporation formed under the laws of the State of Wyoming, U.S.A. (referred to herein as “AVON,” “we,” “us” and “our”), reserves the right to change this Agreement, in whole or in part, from time to time at our sole discretion, and to provide you with notice of such change by any reasonable means, including without limitation posting the revised version of this Agreement on the AVON WEBSITES. You can determine when this Agreement was last revised by referring to the “LAST UPDATED” legend at the top of this Agreement. You should always check this Agreement prior to using the AVON WEBSITES.

For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms have the following meanings:

* The “AVON Independent Sales Ambassador Contract” means AVON’s Independent Sales Ambassador Contract, collectively with the AVON Independent Sales Ambassador Terms and Conditions attached to or accompanying such contract.
    
* An “AVON Independent Sales Ambassador” is an individual (a) who has agreed, pursuant to the terms of an AVON Independent Sales Ambassador Contract, to be an AVON independent sales ambassador, (b) who remains an active AVON independent sales ambassador in good standing, and (c) whose AVON Independent Sales Ambassador Contract or status as a AVON Independent Sales Ambassador has not been terminated.
    

If you are an AVON Independent Sales Ambassador, you acknowledge and agree that your use of the AVON WEBSITES is subject not only to this Agreement, but also to the terms and conditions contained in your AVON Independent Sales Ambassador Contract and the Avon Privacy Statement.

AVON IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR ALTERATION OF YOUR SUBMISSIONS, TRANSMISSIONS OR DATA OR FOR ANY MATERIAL OR DATA SENT OR RECEIVED OR NOT SENT OR RECEIVED. AVON IS NOT RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY THREATENING, DEFAMATORY, OBSCENE, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONTENT OR CONDUCT OF ANY OTHER PARTY (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY AVON INDEPENDENT SALES AMBASSADOR), OR ANY INFRINGEMENT BY A THIRD PARTY OF ANOTHER’S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, PRIVACY OR OTHER RIGHTS.

You will indemnify and hold the AVON Entities harmless from and against any and all claims, actions, demands, causes of action and other proceedings arising from or related to any of the following (the “Claims”): (a) your misuse of, inability to use, or activities in connection with the AVON WEBSITES; (b) any violation of this Agreement or any other AVON terms, conditions or policies by you or through any account you may have with any AVON WEBSITE; (c) any Transaction; (d) any allegation that any Submission or other materials that you make available through the AVON WEBSITES infringe or otherwise violate the intellectual property, privacy, or other rights of any third party; or (e) your violation of any rights of any AVON WEBSITE visitor, user, or customer, or any other third party; and you agree to reimburse the AVON Entities on demand for any damages, losses, costs, judgments, fees, fines and other expenses they incur (including attorneys’ fees and court costs) as a result of any Claim(s). This provision does not require you to indemnify any of the AVON Entities for any unconscionable commercial practice by such party or for such party’s fraud, deception, false promise, misrepresentation or concealment, suppression or omission of any material fact in connection with any AVON WEBSITE or any content provided hereunder.

**13\. Termination and Enforcement.**

This Agreement is effective until terminated by AVON. You agree that AVON, at its sole discretion, may terminate your access to or use of the AVON WEBSITES, at any time and for any reason, including without limitation if AVON believes that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of this Agreement (including but not limited to your failure to comply with the rules of conduct set forth in Section 5 above). Upon any such termination, your right to use the AVON WEBSITES will immediately cease. You agree that any termination of your access to or use of the AVON WEBSITES may be effected without prior notice and that AVON may immediately deactivate or delete any user name and/or password used by or provided to you, and all related information and files associated therewith, and/or bar any further access to such information or files. You agree that AVON shall not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access to the AVON WEBSITES or to any such information or files, and shall not be required to make such information or files available to you after any such termination. AVON reserves the right to takes steps that AVON believes are necessary or appropriate to enforce and/or verify compliance with this Agreement (including without limitation in connection with any legal process relating to your use of the AVON WEBSITES and/or a third party claim that your use of the AVON WEBSITES is unlawful or violates such third party’s rights).

**14\. Claims of Copyright Infringement.**

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the “DMCA”) provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials available on a AVON WEBSITE infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send AVON a notice requesting that AVON remove the materials or block access to them. If you believe in good faith that someone has wrongly filed a notice of copyright infringement against you, the DMCA permits you to send AVON a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA. See [http://www.copyright.gov/](http://www.copyright.gov/) for details. Notices and counter-notices should be sent to The Avon Company Attn: Office of the General Counsel, One Liberty Plaza, 165 Broadway, NY, NY 10006. We suggest that you consult your legal advisor before filing a notice or counter-notice. Also, please be aware that there are penalties for false claims under the DMCA.

**15\. Filtering.**

Pursuant to 47 U.S.C. Section 230(d), as amended, we hereby notify you that parental control protections (such as computer hardware, software or filtering services) are commercially available that may assist you in limiting access to material that is harmful to minors. Information identifying current providers of such protections is available on the following site: [https://www.techradar.com/news/the-best-free-parental-control-software](https://www.techradar.com/news/the-best-free-parental-control-software). Note that AVON does not endorse, support or approve any of the products or services listed at such site.

**16\. Information or Complaints.**

Under California Civil Code Section 1789.3, California users are entitled to the following consumer rights notice:

If you have a question or complaint regarding the AVON WEBSITES, please send an email to [avon\_privacy@ avonusa.com](mailto:avon_privacy@%20avonusa.com). You may also contact us by writing to The Avon Company Attn: Office of the General Counsel, One Liberty Plaza, 165 Broadway, NY, NY 10006, or by calling us at: Customers: [1-800-500-AVON](tel:1-800-500-AVON) and Ambassadors: [1-866-513-AVON](tel:1-866-513-AVON). California residents may reach the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services of the California Department of Consumer Affairs by mail at 1625 North Market Blvd., Sacramento, CA 95834 or by telephone at [(916) 445-1254](tel:(916) 445-1254) or [(800) 952-5210](tel:(800) 952-5210).

**17\. Agreement To Arbitrate Disputes And Choice Of Law.**

PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND TO HAVE A JURY HEAR YOUR CLAIMS. It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.

**WE BOTH AGREE TO ARBITRATE:** You and AVON agree to resolve any claims relating to this Agreement through final and binding arbitration, except that, to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate AVON’s intellectual property rights (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights). Under such circumstances we may bring a lawsuit solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the AVON WEBSITE, or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute-resolution process described above.

**WHAT IS ARBITRATION:** Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court and seeks to resolve disputes more quickly. Instead of a judge or a jury, the case will be decided by a neutral arbitrator who has the power to award the same damages and relief that a court can. If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision shall be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms shall be enforced.

**ARBITRATION PROCEDURES:** The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute resolution provision. Arbitration shall be initiated through JAMS. Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms shall be referred to and finally determined by arbitration in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures in front of one arbitrator. If there is a conflict between JAMS Rules and the rules set forth in this Agreement, the rules set forth in this Agreement will govern. The JAMS Rules and instructions for how to initiate an arbitration are available from JAMS at [https://www.jamsadr.com](https://www.jamsadr.com/) or [1-800-352- 5267](tel:1-800-352- 5267). To initiate arbitration, you or AVON must do the following things:

1. Write a demand for Arbitration. The demand must include a description of the Claim and the amount of damages sought to be recovered. You can find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at [www.jamsadr.com](https://www.jamsadr.com/).
    
2. Send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee to your local JAMS office or to JAMS, Two Embarcadero Center, Suite 1500, San Francisco, CA 94111
    
3. Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the other party.
    

Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS Rules. If travelling to California is a burden, you may participate in the arbitration by phone or via document submission to the fullest extent allowable by the arbitrator. Each party will bear their own costs of arbitration unless the arbitrator directs that bearing such costs would be an undue burden and in that case, we will pay for your portion of the arbitration administrative costs (but not your attorneys’ fees). Arbitration under this agreement shall be held in the United States in the Central District of California under California law without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. The arbitration may award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive relief). Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

**AUTHORITY OF ARBITRATOR:** The arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and AVON, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the Arbitration Rules, and this Agreement. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and AVON.

**NO CLASS ACTIONS:** You may only resolve disputes with us on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed.

**WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL:** THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and AVON in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND AVON WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT YOU MAY CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY IN DECIDING TO ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE.
