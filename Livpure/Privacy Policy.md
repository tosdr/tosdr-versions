**Good**

I installed it on last week of Dec 2023. Installation was quick and supportive from Livepure team. Untill now, it is working fine. I will update my review after few months based on my experience. It will be unjust to give any review without using for a significant period.

**Very Nice Taste**

No requirement of any external Sediment filter. Very nice taste after filteration.  
No bitterness. Model is also looking elegant in design.  
Overall recommended product.
