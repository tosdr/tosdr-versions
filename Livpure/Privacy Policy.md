[Glitz (UV+UF) Water Purifier](https://livpure.com/products/glitz-water-purifier-uv-uf#judgeme_product_reviews)

Prabhanjan Moleyar

**Happy**

Ordered Livpure Glitz UV+UF filter by calling the number given on the product site. On the website, the product was shown as 'Sold Out' but the customer care executive was able to add to the stock and guided me through the purchase process. Apart from the tracking number provided, there were no updates for a few days, and then suddenly there was an update that the delivery would be made next day. The delivery got delayed by a day as I was not available on site, but I did not have to do any follow-up. The installation request was triggered automatically, I did not have to do anything. Again, the installation was delayed due to my unavailability, but again I did not have to do any follow-up. The system seems to have automatically escalated the delay until the installation was completed. I have used the same filter earlier. The only one negative comment I have is that the tap tends to get cut very easily, but otherwise the filter has been trouble-free.

**Good**

I installed it on last week of Dec 2023. Installation was quick and supportive from Livepure team. Untill now, it is working fine. I will update my review after few months based on my experience. It will be unjust to give any review without using for a significant period.
