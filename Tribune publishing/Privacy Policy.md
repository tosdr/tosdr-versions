* Protect our users and our legal rights, privacy, or safety and that of our subsidiaries, Affiliates, employees, agents, contractors, or other individuals, including by enforcing this Privacy Policy, our [Cookie Policy](https://www.tribpub.com/cookie-policy), our [Subscriber Terms & Conditions](https://www.tribpub.com/subscriber-terms-and-conditions/), and/or our [Central Terms of Service](https://www.tribpub.com/central-terms-of-service/);

6\. How Do We Use Online Analytics & Interest-Based Advertising?
----------------------------------------------------------------

##### 6.1 Our Use of Online Analytics.

We may use third-party web analytics services on our Services, such as those provided by Google Analytics, Adobe Omniture, The Trade Desk, and similar providers. These service providers use the sort of technology described in our [Cookie Policy](https://www.tribpub.com/cookie-policy) and [Section 3.2.3](#Cookies&OtherInformationTechnologiesCookies) of this Privacy Policy to help us analyze how users use the Services, including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive. The information (including your IP address) collected by these technologies will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Services. We also use Google Analytics for certain purposes related to advertising, as described in [Section 6.2](#Our_Use_of_Interest_Based_Advertising) and [Section 8.1](#Managing_Your_Account_Privacy_Rights_&_Choices) of this Privacy Policy and in our [Cookie Policy](https://www.tribpub.com/cookie-policy).

##### 6.2 Our Use of Interest-Based Advertising.

When you use the Services, we may serve you with ads based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, Personal Information and other information that you provide, such as, your age or gender, your searches, demographic and geographic data, User-Generated Content, and other information that you provide to us. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and may be based on your interests.

Also, third parties, including without limitation those whose products or services are accessible or advertised via the Services, may place cookies, web beacons or pixel tags, or other similar tracking technologies (such as mobile ‘SDKs,’ which function like a mobile version of a browser cookie and are embedded in mobile applications) on your computer browser, mobile phone applications, or other device to collect information about your use of the Services, including your Personal Information, in order to: (i) inform, optimize, and serve ads based on past visits to our websites and other sites and mobile applications; and (ii) report how our ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our Websites, Applications, Platform, and the use of our Services. We also allow other third parties to serve interest-based ads to you via the Services, and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services so that interest-based ads may be delivered to you when you are using other websites and mobile applications. We also may share with third-party advertisers a hashed version of your email address, which may be identified by a service provider for purposes of delivering interest-based advertising on the Services, other websites, and/or mobile applications. We likewise may work with platform providers who serve advertising across devices. For instance, we may want to reach our web-based customers when they are on their mobile devices. This is done, generally, by correlating common attributes (such as IP addresses, other browser or device information or hashed email addresses) across devices, to infer a common identity across multiple channels.

The third parties that use these technologies may offer you a way to opt-out of interest-based ad targeting, as is described below the [Cookie Policy](https://www.tribpub.com/cookie-policy) and in [Section 8](#What_Are_Your_Rights_&_Choices) of this Privacy Policy. We do not maintain or control these opt-opt mechanisms, which are provided by non-affiliated third parties. Further, we do not control which third parties choose to participate in these opt-out mechanisms. Please note that opting out of interest-based advertising does not mean that you will no longer see advertising on the Services, but these ads may be less relevant to your interests.

For additional information about your legal rights regarding our collection and sharing, selling, or other disclosure of your Personal Information to third parties, please refer to the following Sections of this Privacy Policy: [Section 8(What Are Your Rights & Choices?)](#What_Are_Your_Rights_&_Choices), [Section 9 (Your California Rights)](#Your_California_Rights), [Section 10 (Use of The Services By Users From Outside The United States)](#Use_Of_The_Services_By_Users_From_Outside_Of_The_United_States), [Section 11 (Your Nevada Rights & Choices)](#Your_Nevada_Rights_&_Choices), [Section 12 (Your Virginia Rights & Choices)](#Your_Virginia_Rights_&_Choices) [Section 13 (Your Colorado Rights & Choices)](#Your_Colorado_Rights_&_Choices), and [Section 14 (Your Connecticut Rights & Choices)](#Your_Connecticut_Rights_&_Choices) and [Section 15 (Your Utah Rights & Choices)](#Your_Utah_Rights_&_Choices)

7\. How Do Third Parties Collect & Use Your Information Through Our Services?

Subject to applicable laws, these third-party entities may use your Personal Information in any way they choose, including to market to you or to share your Personal Information with others. Subject to applicable laws, in those instances, your Personal Information may be covered by those third-party entities’ privacy policies. In some cases, these third-party entities may not have any online presence. Therefore, you should only submit your Personal Information in these cases when you are comfortable doing so given the conditions. If you have questions about the privacy practices of these third-party entities, we encourage you to contact them and review their privacy policies.

You can unsubscribe to these emails by either following the instructions in the email for opting-out of receiving future emails, or by calling the official customer service number listed in the “Contact Us” webpage of the Website of the newspaper publication from which you are receiving emails and making a request to no longer receive emails.
    
2. Promotions Via Mail or Telephone
    
    Sometimes, we may contact you via mail or telephone with promotions for our Services. You can ask us to opt-out these mail or telephone solicitations. In certain jurisdictions, as is discussed elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, you may also have the right to instruct us to not share your Personal Information with third parties for direct marketing purposes. To opt-out of future mail or telephone solicitations regarding the Services, please call the official customer service number listed in the “Contact Us” webpage of the Website of the newspaper publication from which you are receiving mail or telephone solicitations and make a request to no longer receive them.
    
3. SMS/Text Message Alerts
    
    If you receive marketing-related SMS/text message alerts from us in connection with the Services, you can opt-out of receiving them by replying “STOP” or any alternate keyword that we have shared with you. We will work to implement your opt-out request quickly and within the timeframes required by applicable laws. However, please note, that your opt-out request will not prohibit us from sending you important non-marketing SMS/text message alerts about your account or use of the Services.
    
4. Push Notifications
    
    You can opt-out of receiving push notifications from us changing your settings on the device that is sending you push notifications from us, or by uninstalling the Application that is sending you push notifications from us.
    
5. Platform & Web Browser Controls
    * **Cookie Controls & Settings**
        
        As is discussed in [Section 3.2.3](#Cookies&OtherInformationTechnologiesCookies) of this Privacy Policy in and our [Cookie Policy](https://www.tribpub.com/cookie-policy), when you access the Services via the Internet or an Internet-connected device, we may place or collect “cookies” from your web browser or device, and we may use these cookies for various purposes. Depending on the jurisdiction in which you reside, some of these cookies may constitute your Personal Information under applicable law.
        
        Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. However, you can go to the settings menu of your web browser to learn how to delete or reject cookies. Additionally, the Websites on which we provide the Services offer you the capability to choose certain cookie preferences about whether or not your web browser will accept – or instead will block/reject – certain cookies from our Website. To implement your personal cookie preferences for a Website on which you access the Services, please click on the “Cookie Preferences” link at the bottom of the webpage of the Website to access the cookie preferences menu.
        
        Once you have opened the cookie preferences menu, you can choose whether your web browser will accept or block/reject certain types of cookies from the Website. In the cookie preferences menu, you can also opt-out of our “sale” or “share” to third parties of the “Personal Information” (as these quoted terms are defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act) that we collect about you via cookies on that Website. For additional information about opting-out of our “sales” or “shares” of your Personal Information, please refer to Section 9 of this Privacy Policy ([Your California Privacy Rights](#Your_California_Rights)).
        
        Please review, and be aware of, the following regarding your choice to delete, reject, or otherwise opt-out of cookies in connection with your use of the Services:
        
        * If you choose to delete or reject cookies on your web browser or device, this could affect certain features or Services that we provide via our Websites and Applications;
        * These cookie blocking and opt-out mechanisms are unique to your computer, tablet, device, and web browser, which means that you will need to re-implement your cookie blocking our opt-out preferences on each such computer, tablet, device, and web browser that you use;
        * If you clear or delete your cookies on your device or web browser after opting-out of cookies or configuring our cookie preferences menu to block or reject cookies, this will result in the deletion of the opt-out or blocking cookie on your web browser or device, meaning you will need to opt-out or configure our cookie preferences menu again after clearing or deleting the cookies (this may also apply to “Do Not Sell/Share My Personal Information” signals/preferences that you implement via our cookies preferences menu on our Websites); and
        * After you opt-out of cookies or configure your personalized cookie preferences on our Websites to block/reject cookies, you may continue to receive advertising via our Services, but those ads may be less relevant to you.
        
        For additional information about cookies, implementing your personalized cookie preferences on our Websites, and how we collect and use cookies, please refer to our [Cookie Policy](https://www.tribpub.com/cookie-policy). Please also refer to Section 8.2 of this Privacy Policy ([Your Additional Rights and Choices For Third Parties & Our Online Analytics & Interest-Based Advertising Practices](#your_additional_rights_&_choices_for_third)) for additional information about how to opt-out of cookies and similar technologies using third-party opt-out mechanisms.
        
    * **Global Privacy Control (GCP)**
        
        Some web browsers and browser extensions support the [Global Privacy Control](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/) (“GCP”), which can send a signal to the websites you visit that indicates your choice to opt-out of certain types of uses and disclosures of your Personal Information, including sales of your Personal Information. For users of the Services in certain jurisdictions, when we detect a GCP signal, we will make reasonable efforts to respect your privacy-related choices that are identified by the GCP signal we detected and the GCP setting you implemented, as required by applicable laws.
        
    * **Do Not Track (DNT)**
        
        Some web browsers offer a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) setting that can send a signal to the websites that you visit, which indicates that you do not wish to be tracked by the websites. However, unlike the GCP signals described above, there is no common understanding of how to interpret such DNT signals as of the “Last Updated Date” of this Privacy Policy. As such, our Websites and Applications **do not** respond to web browser DNT signals. However, as is discussed above in this Privacy Policy, you may change the privacy preferences in your web browser to prevent or limit the use of cookies or similar technologies. To learn more about managing, blocking, and deleting cookies, please refer to our [Cookie Policy](https://www.tribpub.com/cookie-policy). As is discussed above, blocking or deleting cookies or similar technologies, may affect your browsing experience on our Websites and may prevent you from accessing or using certain of our Services, including some of the personalized features that we provide to users as part of the Services.
        
    * **Mobile Advertising ID Controls for iOS and Android Users**
        
        Mobile devices running on iOS and Android operating systems provide options about how to limit tracking and/or reset advertising IDs.

These third parties that provide the interest-based advertising services and technologies we use on our Services may offer you a way to opt-out of interest-based ad targeting. We do not maintain or control these opt-out mechanisms, which are provided and controlled by non-affiliated third parties. Furthermore, we do not control which third parties participate in these opt-out mechanisms. Please note that opting out of interest-based advertising does not mean that you will no longer see advertising on the Services, but these ads may be less relevant to your interests.

**CCPA/CPRA Rights**

The California Privacy Laws (i.e., the CCPA as amended by the CPRA) grants California residents the rights described below. These rights are not absolute and are subject to certain exemptions. As such, in certain cases, we may deny your requests regarding these rights as permitted by law.

1. **Right to Know.** The right to know what Personal Information we have collected about you, including the categories of Personal Information, the categories of sources from which we collected Personal Information, the business or commercial purpose for collecting, selling or sharing (if applicable), the categories of third parties to whom we sell or share Personal Information (if applicable), and the specific pieces of Personal Information we collected about you;
2. **Right to Delete**. The right to delete Personal Information that we collected about you, subject to certain exceptions;
3. **Right to Correct**. The right to correct inaccurate Personal Information that we maintain about you;
4. **Right to Opt-Out**. If we sell or share your Personal Information, the right for you to opt-out of the sale or sharing;
5. **Right to Limit**. If we sell or disclose your Sensitive Personal Information for purposes other than those allowed by the CCPA and its regulations, the right to limit our use or disclosure of the Sensitive Personal Information; and
6. **Right to Not Receive Discriminatory Treatment**. The right not to receive discriminatory treatment by us for the exercise of the privacy rights the CCPA confers.

You will not receive any discriminatory treatment from us for exercising any of the privacy rights granted to you by the CCPA. Similarly, we will not retaliate against any of our employees, job applicants, and independent contractors for exercising any privacy right available to them under the CCPA.

**Right to Opt-Out**. You have a right to opt-out from the sale or sharing of your Personal Information. As stated above, we do not “sell” your Personal Information in the traditional sense (i.e., for money). However, we may disclose your Personal Information in the following ways that may constitute a “sale” and/or “share” of your Personal Information within the legal definitions of those terms under the California Privacy Laws:

* Like many news media companies, we use services that help us deliver interest-based ads to you on our Websites, Applications, and Platform, such as the services associated with cookies described in this Privacy Policy and our [Cookie Policy](https://www.tribpub.com/cookie-policy). Our use of these services may constitute a “sale” or “share” of your Personal Information for purposes of the California Privacy Laws, because the advertising partners we use that provide these services collect information from our users, including Personal Information, when users visit our Websites, Applications, or Platform (e.g., device data, cookies, online activity, IP address, as described above) to help serve ads to users that are more likely to be of interest to them.

Additionally, if your browser supports it, you can turn on the [Global Privacy Control](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/) (GCP) to opt-out of the “sale” or “sharing” of your Personal Information. Please refer to the “Global Privacy Control (GCP)” discussion above in [Section 8.1](#Managing_Your_Account_Privacy_Rights_&_Choices) of this Privacy Policy for additional information.

**Authorized Agent**. If you are submitting a request on behalf of a California resident, please submit the request through one of the designated methods discussed in this Privacy Policy.

Such customers may exercise this option by submitting a CCPA opt-out request [here](https://my.datasubject.com/16A1AnRt2Fn8i1unj/23233).

Please make all such requests via email to us at [Privacy@tribpub.com](mailto: Privacy@tribpub.com)

**Notice of Financial Incentive**  
We offer programs, benefits, and other offerings to consumers that use the Services like you related to our collection and use of Personal Information that might be deemed a “financial incentive” or “price service difference” under the CCPA as amended by the CPRA.

You may cancel your subscription to any of our newsletters at any time by either following the instructions to cancel your subscription to receive email newsletters provided in the emails that deliver the newsletters to you, or by calling the official customer service number provided in the “Contact Us” webpage of the Website from which you receive emails and making a request to stop receiving the newsletters. Our good-faith estimate of the value of your Personal Information for participating in our newsletter program is the value of the benefit we offer you. We have calculated such value by using the expense related to the benefit.

    We may offer users of the Services the opportunity to participate in surveys about the Services. In exchange for your participation in a survey, you may be offered a financial incentive, such as: free products or services; free or discounted Services that we offer; the opportunity to participate in other promotions; and other discounts or coupons.

The specific terms and conditions applicable to the survey will also tell you how to participate in the survey. You can terminate your participation in the survey at any time as will be explained in the specific terms and conditions applicable to the survey or by unsubscribing to our Services. Our good-faith estimate of the value of your Personal Information for participating in our survey programs is the value of the benefit we offer you. We have calculated such value by using the expense related to the benefit.
* **Limited Time Promotions, Contests, or Sweepstakes**.  
    From time-to-time, we also may offer you incentives limited to a specific time period, such as, limited-time promotions, contests, or sweepstakes. In exchange for your participation in these programs, you may be offered a financial incentive, such as, a prize or discount to receive the Services. As part of these limited-time programs, we may collect and use your personal information, such as, your name; mailing address; email address; telephone number; beliefs; customer records; opinions; preferences; inferences; experiences; Internet or other electronic network activity information and device information; protected class and demographic information; and audio, electronic, visual, and other sensory information.

We have calculated such value by using the expense related to the benefit.
* **Free Internet Browsing of Our Services, Applications, or Websites**.  
    The content of most of our Applications and Websites through which consumers like you can access our Services on the Internet is usually protected by a paywall. This means that, typically, after you have browsed a pre-determined number of free articles or content on our Websites or Applications, the paywall will prevent you from further accessing our content and Services unless you sign up for a paid subscription. However, some of the Websites and Applications for certain of our newspaper publications may choose to either (1) not implement a paywall for any content on its Website or Application at all, or (2) not have the paywall functionality implemented for certain particularly time-sensitive or politically/socially relevant news articles or content. This means that you may be able to access and browse some of our Services on some of our Websites and Applications for free. This may be deemed a “financial incentive” or “price service difference” under the CCPA as amended by the CPRA. By accessing and browsing any of our Services on any of our Websites or Applications for free over the Internet where our paywalls to not limit your access or browsing ability, you may be offered a financial incentive, such as, free access over the Internet to select content, Websites, or Applications that we provide as part of our Services to paying customers. In exchange for your access to certain free content, Websites, or Applications that we provide as part of our Services, we may collect and use your Personal Information, such as: identifiers, IP Address, Internet or other electronic network activity information and device information, and inferences. Participation in our “free access to Services” programs is governed by this Privacy Policy, our [Cookie Policy](https://www.tribpub.com/cookie-policy), o[Subscriber Terms & Conditions](https://www.tribpub.com/subscriber-terms-and-conditions/), and/or our [Central Terms of Service](https://www.tribpub.com/central-terms-of-service/).

10\. Use of The Services By Users From Outside The United States.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Our Services, Websites, Applications, and Platform are not intended to be used by consumers located outside of the United States. In order to ensure our compliance with the consumer privacy laws of non-US countries or jurisdictions (such as the European Union, European Economic Area, and the UK), we block users with IP addresses from these countries and others from accessing our Services, Websites, Applications, and Platform via the Internet. If you are a resident of a non-US country or jurisdiction that has enacted consumer privacy laws (such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“**GDPR**”) or the United Kingdom’s General Data Protection Regulation (the “**UK GDPR**”)) and are currently physically located in that non-US country or jurisdiction, please do not use our Service, Websites, Applications, or Platform. We are not responsible for ensuring our compliance with the consumer privacy laws of non-US countries or jurisdictions (such as GDPR or UK GDPR) for users that use Virtual Privacy Networks (VPNs) or similar technologies to circumvent the controls that we put in place to block access to our Services, Websites, Applications, and Platform in the countries or jurisdictions that we decide to block. In light of these circumstances, please note that the following discussion included in this Section 10 of this Privacy Policy is intended to address unlikely circumstances where: (1) you reside in, and are physically located in, the European Union, European Economic Area, UK, Switzerland, or another country that we block from accessing the Services, Websites, Applications, or Platform via the Internet; and (2) you are nevertheless able to use the Services or access our Websites, Applications, or Platform via the Internet.

If and to the extent that you can access the Services, Websites, Applications, or Platform, under applicable law in the European Economic Area, UK, and Switzerland, Tribune is considered a “data controller” of the Personal Information that we handle under this Privacy Policy. In other words, Tribune is responsible for deciding how to collect, use, and disclose this Personal Information, subject to applicable law. Our contact information appears at the end of this Privacy Policy. Under applicable laws, if you are a resident of certain jurisdictions outside of the United States and use the Services, you may be able to request one or more individual rights set forth in the “Your EU, EEA, UK, and Switzerland Rights & Choices” Section of this Privacy Policy below.

##### 10.1 Your EU, EEA, UK, & Switzerland Rights & Choices.

We are headquartered in the United States, where we store and process information relating to the use of the Services, including your Personal Information. If you are located outside of the United States, your Personal Information is collected in your country and then transferred to the United States – or another country in which we (or our service providers) operate.

If we transfer your Personal Information outside of the European Economic Area, we implement at least one of the following safeguards:

* We transfer your Personal Information to countries that the European Commission has determined provide an adequate level of data protection (a full list of these countries can be found [here).](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions_en)
* We take steps to ensure that the recipient of your Personal Information is bound by contractual obligations, including the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (“**SCCs**”) and additional safeguards to protect your Personal Information (you may review the EU SCCs that came into effect in September 2021 [here](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en)).

The courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies, or security authorities in these countries may sometimes be entitled to access your Personal Information under applicable laws.

If you are a resident of the EU, EEA, UK, or Switzerland, you have certain privacy rights under applicable laws, which include:

* Your right to access and copy certain Personal Information that we maintain about you;
* Your right to correct or update Personal Information that we maintain about you information that is incorrect or outdated;
* Your right to prevent the processing of your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes (including direct marketing processing based on profiling);
* Your right to delete certain Personal Information that we maintain about you;
* Your right to transfer the Personal Information that we hold about you to a third-party service provider;
* Your right to restrict the way we process and disclose certain of your Personal Information; and
* Your right to revoke your consent to the processing of your Personal Information.

If you reside in a country other than one of those listed above, you may be able to make a request to us to exercise one or more of the rights listed above under applicable laws. In order to make such a request to us, you may contact us [Privacy@tribpub.com](mailto:privacy@tribpub.com). So that we may respond to your request, we may need to verify your identity, country of residence, or require that you provide us with additional information.

If applicable, if you think your rights have been violated, you may make a complaint to the data protection supervisory authority in the country in which you reside or seek a remedy through the local court system. However, we encourage you to [first contact us](#How_To_Contact_Us) with any questions or concerns if you feel your rights have been violated.

**Your Additional Marketing & Interest-Based Advertising Choices**  
Our [Cookie Policy](https://www.tribpub.com/cookie-policy) has information about how to manage your cookies and other choices that may be available to you with respect to personalized advertising. Additional information about how to opt-out of cookies and similar technologies that we use on the Services for online analytics and interest-based advertising purposes is also detailed in Section 8.2 of this Privacy Policy ([Your Additional Rights & Choices For Third Parties & Our Online Analytics & Interest-Based Advertising Practices](#your_additional_rights_&_choices_for_third)).

If you reside in the EU, EEA, UK, Canda, or Switzerland you may opt-out of (i.e., withdraw your consent to) receiving marketing emails from us by following the instructions in such emails. You may also withdraw your consent to our use of your email to provide you with special offers via email and through certain other means (such as Social Media) by emailing us at [Privacy@tribpub.com](mailto:privacy@tribpub.com).

**What is Our Legal Basis?**  
In certain jurisdictions, like the European Union and the European Economic Area, we may only collect, use, or share Personal Information about you if we have a valid reason (i.e., a “lawful basis”). A valid reason (i.e., a “lawful basis”) is one of the following:

* You provide us with your consent at the point of collection of your Personal Information;
* The performance of a contract that we have with you;
* Our compliance with a legal obligation that we are subject to;
* Our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of a third party. A “legitimate interest” is a special legal term under international privacy laws, like the GDPR, which essentially means that there are good reasons for the processing of your personal information, and that we take measures to minimize the impact on your privacy rights. The term “legitimate interest” can also refer to our use of your Personal Information in ways that you would reasonably expect and that have a minimal impact on your privacy rights.

We have legitimate interests in gathering and processing Personal Information. Our legitimate interests include, but are not necessarily limited to: administering and conducting business within Tribune; ensuring that our networks, Services, Websites, Applications, Platform, and information are secure; conducting our marketing activities; and preventing fraud.

11\. Your Nevada Rights & Choices.
----------------------------------

Under Nevada law, if you are a resident of Nevada, you may opt-out of our “sale” of your “covered information”, as these terms are defined under Nevada law. For purposes of Nevada law, “covered information” includes your first and last name, address, email address, phone number, Social Security Number, or an identifier that allows a specific person to be contacted either physically or online.

If you are a Nevada resident and have purchased or leased goods or services from us, you may submit a request to opt-out of any potential future “sales” by us of your “covered information” by clicking [here](https://my.datasubject.com/16A1AnRt2Fn8i1unj/23233) or the “Do Not Sell/Share My Personal Information” link on the bottom of the webpage where your Personal Information is being collected.

14\. Your Connecticut Rights and Choices
----------------------------------------

This Section 14 of this Privacy Policy describes the privacy-related rights and choices that residents of Connecticut have, effective July 1, 2023, under the Connecticut Data Privacy Act (**“CTDPA”**).

Effective July 1, 2023, if you are a Connecticut resident, the CTDPA grants you the privacy-related rights described below. These rights are not absolute and are subject to certain exemptions. As such, in certain cases, we may deny your requests regarding these rights as permitted by law.

1. **Right to Opt Out**. As is described in greater detail below in this Section 14, you have the right to opt out of our processing of your Personal Information, if we process your Personal Information for any of the following three purposes: (A) “Targeted Advertising” (as defined by the CTDPA), (B) the “Sale” (as defined by the CTDPA) of your Personal Information, or (C) or “Profiling” in furtherance of “Decisions That Produce Legal or Similarly Significant Effects For a Consumer” (i.e., for you) (as defined by the CTDPA).
2. **Right to Confirm**. You have the right to request our confirmation about whether we process Personal Information about you.
3. **Right to Access**. If we process Personal Information about you, you have the right to access the Personal Information about you that we process.
4. **Right to Data Portability**. If you exercise your right to access your Personal Information that we collect about you, you have the right to obtain the Personal Information we maintain about you in a portable (and to the extent technically feasible) readily available format that allows you to transmit that Personal Information to another entity without hinderance, subject to certain exceptions.
5. **Right to Correction**. You have the right to correct inaccuracies in the Personal Information that we process about you, subject to certain exceptions.
6. **Right to Deletion**. If we process Personal Information about you, you have the right to instruct us to permanently delete that Personal Information, subject to certain exceptions.
7. **Right to Revoke Consent**. Under the CTDPA, in certain circumstances, we are only permitted to process your Personal Information if you have given us your prior informed consent to the processing. For example, we may only process your “Sensitive Data” (as defined by the CTDPA) under the CTDPA if you have given us your prior informed consent to the processing of your Sensitive Data. In circumstances where your prior informed consent is required to allow us to process your Personal Information, and you have previously granted us your prior informed consent, the CTDPA gives you the right to revoke this prior consent. Depending on the circumstances, where applicable, we may treat your revocation of your prior consent like a request to delete your Personal Information and cease further processing activities.
    * You will not receive any discriminatory or retaliatory treatment from us for exercising any of the privacy rights granted to you by the CTDPA.
    * If you are a Connecticut resident, your authorized agent (i.e., a third party acting on your behalf with your express consent) may submit a request to us on your behalf for you to exercise any of the privacy-related rights above under the CTDPA. If you are submitting a request on behalf of a Connecticut resident, please submit the request through one of the designated methods discussed in this Privacy Policy. After submitting the request, if the request is not subject to an exemption or exception, we may require additional information to verify that you have the authority to act on behalf of the Connecticut resident.
    * For a discussion of the categories of Personal Information that we collect and use (i.e., process) about Connecticut residents, the categories of Personal Information that we disclose to third parties, and the categories of third parties with whom we disclose Colorado residents’ Personal Information, please refer to [Section 9 (Your California Rights)](##Your_California_Rights) of this Privacy Policy.
