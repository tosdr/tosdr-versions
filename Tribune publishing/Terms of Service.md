Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in these Subscription Terms have the same meanings as are set forth in the [Central Terms of Service](https://www.tribpub.com/central-terms-of-service/).

1\. Continuous Subscription Terms and Right To Cancel
-----------------------------------------------------

All subscriptions are CONTINUOUS, which means your subscription will continue and you will be billed until you cancel the subscription. By providing your payment method information and clicking “Subscribe”, “Accept”, “Continue”, “Register”, or any similar button or icon on any of our websites for placing or submitting an order for a subscription, you accept a CONTINUOUS SUBSCRIPTION. A CONTINUOUS SUBSCRIPTION means that **your initial subscription will automatically renew until canceled**. You have the right to cancel service at any time by calling the appropriate number or sending an email to the appropriate email address listed in [Section 12 (Contact Us) below](#section12). Depending on your jurisdiction, if you started your subscription online, you may also be able to cancel by selecting “Cancel Subscription” in your account settings online. We do not accept written correspondence sent by U.S. mail or otherwise. You will be charged for any service prior to cancellation.

Your introductory rate is valid for the period specified on the order page. That amount will be the initial charge made to your payment method. After the introductory offer, your payment method will automatically be charged the going rate specified on the Order Page until you notify us to cancel.

2\. Automatic Payment/ Easy Pay

By subscribing, you are signing up for Easy Pay.

You may cancel Easy Pay at any time by calling us at the appropriate number in [Section 12 (Contact Us)](#section12) below or online via your subscriber account. This authority remains in effect until canceled. You will be notified no less than 10 days in advance of any price increase or any variation from the amount associated with your subscription term. Revocation of this automatic payment authorization does not cancel your subscription and you must pay for it by other means

3\. Electronic Communications Disclosure Statement and Consent

4\. Disputes; Mandatory Arbitration; Class Action Waiver
--------------------------------------------------------

PLEASE READ THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION CAREFULLY TO UNDERSTAND YOUR RIGHTS. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE STATED BELOW, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT ANY CLAIM THAT YOU OR WE MAY HAVE AGAINST THE OTHER MUST BE RESOLVED THROUGH BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION, AND NOT IN COURT OR AS PART OF ANY CLASS ACTION. DISCOVERY AND APPEAL RIGHTS ARE MORE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION

The terms of this Section 4 apply to all Disputes, as defined below, even if the acts, omissions, or relationships giving rise to such Disputes occurred prior to this version of the Subscription Terms (or such modification). However, if you or we initiated an arbitration or lawsuit prior to this version of the Subscription Terms (or such modification), that arbitration or lawsuit will continue to be governed by the version of the Subscription Terms applicable when the arbitration or lawsuit was initiated.  
If any provision in this Section 4 is deemed to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that provision shall be severed, with the rest of Section 4 of these Subscription Terms remaining in full force and effect. Each provision of this Section 4 applies to the maximum extent permitted by law whether or not so expressly stated.

1. Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver.
    
    You and we agree that this agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq.) applies.
    
    You and we agree to submit all Disputes between us to individual, binding arbitration under the provisions in this Section 4(A). A “Dispute” means any dispute, claim or controversy (except those specifically exempted below) between you and us that in any way arises out of, relates to or is connected with your subscription, your account, your use or attempted use of our website, your use or attempted use of our services, all marketing from us, these Subscription Terms, the [Central Terms of Service](https://www.tribpub.com/central-terms-of-service/), the [Privacy Policy](https://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy/), or any other agreement between you and us, including any disputes over the validity or enforceability of this agreement to arbitrate. A Dispute shall be subject to these Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver provisions regardless of whether it is based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement or negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory.
    
    You and we understand that there is no judge or jury in arbitration and that court review of an arbitration award may be limited.
    
    1. Informal Negotiation Period. Our customer support department is available to address any concerns you may have. Please reach out to the customer support department at the newspaper to which you are subscribed using the contact information in a href=”#section12″>Section 12 (Contact Us)
    
    . Most concerns are quickly resolved in this manner to our customers’ satisfaction. In an effort to accelerate resolution and reduce the cost of any Dispute between us, you and we agree to first attempt to negotiate the Dispute informally (**“Informal Negotiation”**) for at least thirty (30) days before either party initiates any lawsuit or arbitration (**“Initial Dispute Resolution Period”**). That period begins upon receipt of written notice from the party raising the Dispute. If we have a Dispute with you, we will send notice of that Dispute to your email or residential address you have provided to us. If you have a Dispute with us, you must notify us in writing at the following email address: attorney@tribpub.com using the subject line **“Initial Dispute Resolution Notice.”** Your notice of Dispute must be individual to you and must include, as applicable, your name, the email address associated with your subscription or account, and your residential address. The notice of Dispute also must describe the Dispute, explain the facts of the Dispute as you understand them, and tell us what you want us to do to resolve the problem. The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any Dispute directly through consultation and good faith negotiations, and you agree that a notice of Dispute containing all of the information required above, followed by at least 30 days of good faith negotiation, are preconditions to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. If you or we are represented by counsel, you and we will participate in the consultation and good faith negotiations along with your and our respective counsel. A notice of Dispute will not be valid, will not start the Initial Dispute Resolution Period, and will not allow you or us later to initiate a lawsuit or arbitration, unless it contains all of the information required by this paragraph. If either of us commences an arbitration without having previously complied with these Informal Negotiation requirements, you and we agree that the applicable arbitration provider (or the arbitrator, if one has been appointed) must suspend or dismiss the arbitration until the party that initiated it complies. You and we authorize the arbitration provider (or the arbitrator) to decide summarily whether the party that commenced an arbitration complied with the Informal Negotiation requirements.
    
    The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Negotiation process required by this paragraph.
    
    4. Binding Arbitration. If a Dispute cannot be resolved through negotiations during the Initial Dispute Resolution Period, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to formally resolve the Dispute unless an exception applies as stated below.
        
        Except in the event of a Mass Arbitration (as defined below), the arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) in accordance with the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (**“AAA Rules”**) effective as of the date of the notice of Dispute, as modified by these Subscription Terms. The AAA Rules are available on AAA’s website, [http://www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/), or by calling AAA toll free at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitrator must follow applicable law. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on you and us, and any award of the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
        
        The arbitrator shall determine the scope and enforceability of this arbitration agreement, including whether a Dispute is subject to arbitration. The arbitrator has authority to decide all issues of validity, enforceability or arbitrability, including, but not limited to, where a party raises as a defense to arbitration that the claims in question are exempted from the arbitration requirement or that any portion of these Subscription Terms is not enforceable.
        
        If a lawsuit filed in court includes claims or requests for relief that are arbitrable and claims or requests for relief that are not, you and we agree that any non-arbitrable claims or requests for relief shall be stayed pending the completion of the arbitration of the arbitrable claims or requests for relief.
        
    5. Class and Collective Action Waiver. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING DISPUTES AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION OR CLASS ARBITRATION. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity, including but not limited to requests for public injunctive relief.
    6. Claims Exempt from Arbitration. Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all Disputes through arbitration, either party may bring an action in state or federal court that only asserts claims for patent infringement or invalidity, copyright infringement, piracy, moral rights violations, trademark infringement, and/or trade secret misappropriation (**“Excluded IP Claims”**). Excluded IP Claims also are exempt from the Informal Negotiation provisions in Section 4(A)(i) above. Any claims, disputes, proceedings, or actions for Excluded IP Claims and any other claim for which arbitration is denied shall be filed in the appropriate state or federal court located in Cook County, Illinois.
        
        Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all Disputes through arbitration, either party also may seek relief in a small claims court for any individual disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction. If an arbitration is filed, then before the arbitrator is formally appointed, either party can send written notice to the opposing party and the applicable arbitration provider that it wants the case decided by a small claims court, after which the arbitration provider may close the case.
        
    7. Exception – Mass Arbitration Before NAM. Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to have arbitrations administered by AAA, if 25 or more demands for arbitration are filed relating to the same or similar subject matter and sharing common issues of law or fact, and counsel for the parties submitting the demands are the same or coordinated, you and we agree that this will constitute a **“Mass Arbitration.”** If a Mass Arbitration is commenced, you and we agree that it shall not be governed by AAA Rules or administered by AAA. Instead, a Mass Arbitration shall be administered by National Arbitration & Mediation (**“NAM”**), a nationally recognized arbitration provider, and governed by the NAM rules in effect when the Mass Arbitration is filed as modified by these Subscription Terms, including the NAM Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures, but excluding any rules that permit arbitration on a class-wide basis (collectively, the “NAM Rules”). The NAM Rules are available at [http://www.namadr.com](http://www.namadr.com/) or by calling 1-800-358-2550. You and we agree that if either party fails or refuses to commence the Mass Arbitration before NAM rather than AAA, you or we may seek an order from AAA compelling compliance and directing administration of the Mass Arbitration before NAM. Pending resolution of any such requests, you and we agree that all arbitrations comprising the Mass Arbitration (and any obligation to pay arbitration fees) shall be stayed. If for any reason the provisions in this Section 4(A)(v) are found to be unenforceable, or if for any reason NAM declines to administer the Mass Arbitration, then the Disputes comprising the Mass Arbitration shall be administered by AAA.
    8. 30 Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver provisions in this Section 4(A) by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following email address: attorney@tribpub.com, using the subject line “Arbitration Opt-Out.” The notice must be sent within 30 days of the date on which you purchase your subscription or create your account (or if you already had a subscription or account at the time this version of the Subscription Terms became effective, then within 30 days following the Effective Date); otherwise, you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of this Section 4(A). If you opt out of these arbitration provisions, we also will not be bound by them. Opting out of arbitration will not affect in any way the benefits to which you would otherwise be entitled.
    9. Fees and Costs. Payment of arbitration fees shall be determined by the neutral arbitration provider’s rules, as modified by this agreement. We will reimburse you for any portion of the arbitration filing fees that are more than what you would otherwise have to pay to file suit in a court of law. You will not be required to pay any amounts incurred by us if you do not prevail in arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim was frivolous, in bad faith, or brought for harassment or an improper purpose, in which case the arbitrator may award us our attorney’s fees, expert witness fees, arbitration fees and/or costs.
    10. Survival. The Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver provisions in Section 4(A) shall survive termination of these Subscription Terms and your use of our services.
