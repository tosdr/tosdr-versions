**(iv) Payment information**

We will also collect some purchase information (which is comprised of transaction history, including what you have purchased, the price, and the date). Note that your in-app purchase transactions are processed by third-party payment processors, such as Apple (for purchases on iOS devices), Google (for purchases on Android devices), or Amazon (for purchases on Kindle devices), or others.

**3\. YOUR FACE SCAN AND HOW WE HANDLE THIS BIOMETRIC DATA**

**(a) What we collect**

You have to opt-in to our proprietary method of verifying the existence of a real user behind the account creation to provide a better and safer user experience for you (preventing fake or duplicated accounts creation and to enforce our terms of service). When you consent to biometric verification, our App scans your face and measure up to fifty data points also called facial landmarks. Those multiple coordinates are translated into a unique code, that cannot be reverse engineered and regenerate your facial characteristics. This unique code is generated every time a face scan is used and through a probabilistic analysis our system determines the face matching with the account holder reference. To increase the safety and security of our solution, our system may request you to re-scan your face randomly and even prompt you to follow specific validation steps to prevent the system exploitation by fraudsters and or artificial intelligence generated images.  

We keep the profile picture and the unique code generated as reference for the biometric comparison for as long as you have an active account, we also keep temporarily (up to ninety days) further face scans used for login processes and specific consent collections.  

  

**(b) What we do with your face scan**

Although we associate data from your scan with your account, upon login, to verify your identity, our scan of your face is not shared with any developer or third-party company.  

We do not sell, lease, trade, or otherwise profit from a user’s facial scan.  

We may anonymize your face scan and train our computer vision models to improve our system accuracy and deliver a better service to you.  

  

**(c) How long we retain your face scan**

If the user’s account has been inactive for two years, we will automatically delete any facial images that we have in our possession.  

**4\. HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND OUR LEGAL BASES FOR PROCESSING IT**

In general, we collect, store and use your information to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, fun, and customized experience, and we use it as necessary to provide you with the Service pursuant to the Terms of Use, for our legitimate interest to understand how our users navigate our website and App and to improve our Services, or on the basis of your consent. In litigation or for other legal purposes involving us or a third party, we may also need to transfer your personal information to countries with a lower standard of data protection laws than is applicable in your country of residence. We 

will use information collected from you in any one or more of the following ways:  

* To create your Service accounts and allow access to our Services;  
* To identify and suggest connections with other users;  
* To provide technical support and respond to user inquiries;  
* To prevent fraud or potentially illegal activities, and enforce our Terms of Use;  
* To notify users of in-Service updates;  
* To solicit input and feedback to improve GamerSafer Services and customize your user experience;  
* To inform users about new services or promotional offers;  
* To engage in commonly accepted practices, such as contacting you at the email address we have on file if you are a potential winner in a sweepstakes; and  
* To improve and develop our products and Services.  

One important use of your information is communication. If you have provided your e-mail address to us, we’ll use it to (i) respond to customer support inquiries, (ii) keep you informed of your in-Service activity, notifications about in-Service status and requests, and (iii) provide you with details of our similar Services, unless you have asked us to stop sending you our marketing material or opted out from our electronic marketing communications. If you are not a current user, we will send promotional e-mail messages and promotional messages directly or in partnership with third parties only if you have provided your prior consent in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations for us to do so. 

**5\. SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION**

We will not sell or rent any personal information about you with or without your prior consent.  

We will not share any personal information about you without your prior consent.  

Please be aware that the US and other jurisdictions may have a lower standard of data protection laws than your own jurisdiction. We will share your personal data with third party recipients (i.e., parties other than GamerSafer) including outside the European Economic Area, in the following circumstances:  

**(a) Third party service providers**

We provide your information to third party recipients. These categories of recipients include:  

* Hosting providers to store the personal data you provide and for disaster recovery services, as well as for the performance of any contract we enter into with you; 
* Email delivery providers that provide us with email delivery services;  
* Other gaming related platforms such as game publishers, game developers and Esports organizations (we will not share about you without your prior consent).  

We direct all such third-party recipients to maintain the confidentiality of the information disclosed to them and to not use your information for any purpose other than to provide services on our behalf.  

**(b)  Sale or merger**

In the event that we undergo a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, we may transfer all of your information, including personal data, to the successor organization in such transition. In such case, we will first notify you in accordance with local law requirements, if any, regarding those items of personal data that will be transferred, the name and contact details of the recipient, and inform you of how you can withdraw consent thereto.  

**(c) Safety, security and compliance with law**

Your information, and the contents of all of your online communications and activities (including without limitation service usage, log history, player reports, player analytics, and IP addresses) may be accessed and monitored as necessary to provide the Service and may be disclosed: (i) when we have a good faith belief that we are required to disclose the information in response to legal process (for example, a court order, search warrant or subpoena); (ii) to satisfy any applicable laws or regulations; (iii) where we believe that the Service is being used in the commission of a crime, including to report such criminal activity or to exchange information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction; (iv) when we have a good faith belief that there is an emergency that poses a threat to the health and/or safety of you, another person or the public generally; and (v) in order to protect our rights or property.  

**6\. OUR POLICIES CONCERNING CHILDREN**

We care about Children’s privacy rights and safety; we encourage children to use our Services once the core value of that is to help our gaming partners to create inclusive and secured environments and experiences for all players.  

The Children definition varies per country and sometimes per state, to apply the proper regulation we always consider the location where the user is based (information collected during the account registration process).  

Based on user location and data of birth our registration system will redirect children to a dedicated user registration flow where the parent or legal responsible will be invited to join the account creation and be guided about our services, the data collected, the terms of service, the privacy policy and to provide consent to create the account for the children.  

The registration process will first, collect and verify the adult account and them with the consent advance to children account creation.  

**(a)  Parental Consent and Verifiable Parent Consent**

Balance data minimization and safety is at the core of our services and principles, with that on mind we will conduct, at our best capacity balancing data minimization and safety, the data collection to verify the engagement, support and consent of parents, legal responsible, guardian or other responsible adult to the children account creation and service usage.  

Parental consent flow will be initialized any time the children start any process that could lead to any information usage outside of initial consent provided by the parent. Including but not limited to the connection of the children account with a new 3rd party partner/platform, transactions that our partners needs parental consent, any suspicious activities with the account that could be a threat to the user or to other users.  

The definition of verifiable parental consent varies per country and sometimes per state. In the US we follow FTC guidelines, using “face match to verified photo identification” (FMVPI) as a method to verify the person providing consent for a child to our service. This requires a scan of a government issue ID during the registration process (this information is not stored, and just used to verify the adult account information).  

**(b) Parental Choices and Controls**

At any time, parents can refuse to permit us to collect further personal information from their children in association with a particular account and can request that we delete from our records the personal information we have collected in connection with that account. Please keep in mind that a request to delete records may lead to a termination of an account.  

We offer two methods to allow parents to access, change, or delete the personally identifiable information that we have 

collected from their children:  

1.     Parents can request access to and delete their child’s personal information by logging on to the child’s account through our APP. Parents will need their child’s username and password. The Your Account home page explains how to recover a password if your or the child cannot recall it.  

2.     Parents can contact us to request access to, change, or delete their child’s personal information by sending an email to us at support@gamersafer.com. A valid request to delete personal information will be accommodated within a reasonable time.  

In any correspondence such as e-mail, please include the child’s username and the parent’s email address and parent’s username. To protect children’s privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to help verify a parent’s identity before granting access to any personal information.  

If you believe that we might have information from or about a child that violates that policy, please contact us.  

Even though data privacy regulations have their own age boundaries for child definition, if we have any evidence that an user above that age reference is not fully capable of understanding the implications of consent of their data usage, we may request the support of any other legal responsible, parent or guardian to proceed with the consent.  

Any tentative of system exploitation, personification, fraud or any tentative to imply a different age (from adults or from child) to overcome our verification process is a breach of our Terms of Service. 

**7\. YOUR RIGHTS AND HOW TO ACCESS, UPDATE, AND MANAGE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

**(a) GS CrossLink**  

GS CrossLink is a Service to identify and block malicious hyperlinks or attachments into online platforms wrapped as a bot (i.e. Discord bot) and/or API based Service. This Service collects for various reasons non PII information. 

(i) Analytics Data 

GS Crosslink will collect the following information for analytics events: 

● Resolvable links sent in the platform: This data includes the non-PII user ID for the sender of the link, the non-PII server ID for the platform and the resolved link object; A link object contains the domain of the link, the data generated by GS Crosslink about the link (safety, status, flags etc.) and the target URL; All events of this format logged are resolved first, eliminating the potential for personally identifiable short links from being collected & stored; Query string parameters will also be stripped from the target URL in the link object.  

● Platform server where GS Crosslink is added to and removed from: This data only contains the platform server ID. 

Analytics data is stored indefinitely & encrypted at rest. If you wish for all analytics data from your platform server to be completely anonymized or removed, please reach out to support@gamersafer.com with a relevant data removal request. We currently do not support do-not-track status on a per-server or per-user basis, so if you wish for no more data to be collected you must remove GS Crosslink from your platform. 

(ii) Link Data  

Links sent in the platform and detected by GS Crosslink will have several operations performed on them which extract various elements of data. Links will be resolved meaning a full redirect chain will be retained by GS Crosslink. DNS lookups will be performed on links meaning all DNS data will be collected but not retained by GS Crosslink. This data includes MX servers & other records. DNS data is considered public information, so it is freely collected without restrictions. WHOIS & RDAP records may be collected by GS Crosslink on domains it sees during operation. These records are not retained and contact information is discarded. This data is collected to help GS Crosslink build a profile of links it detects, and none is preserved in data later stored by GS Crosslink.  

(iii) Discord Event Data  

When working with Discord, GS Crosslink is required to collect certain event data from Discord for core functionality. This includes GS Crosslink’s commands run by end users & messages sent by end users. Currently no other events are tracked by GS Crosslink. GS Crosslink does not store full message content, it only retains links detected within message content/embeds and links to attachments sent within messages. Attachments sent in Discord are covered by Discord’s own Data policy, and will have all associated data removed once the attachment is removed from Discord’s CDN. Message content may be sent via a Discord message from the GS Crosslink bot to logs on a per-server/guild basis as configured by the relevant server’s staff. This logging only occurs when GS Crosslink detects a link type that has been configured to be logged in a message.  

(iv) 3rd Party Data  

GS Crosslink collects public data on links & domains from 3rd party providers
