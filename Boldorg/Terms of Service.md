SPECIFIC ADDITIONAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS
----------------------------------------

These Specific Additional Terms and Conditions set forth terms applicable only to (i) using of the Site to enroll as an applicant or (ii) an applicant who is logged in and using the Service.

If you use any of the following parts of the Service, the terms below apply to you in addition to the Terms of Use above:

1. Connected Accounts. Bold offers products and services that allow you to “connect” or “link” external accounts, such as a bank account, a loan, or a credit card account held at another institution. You agree to the following terms and conditions when you connect an account at another institution:

* If you elect to connect or link any such account at another institution, we refer to it as a “Connected Account.”
* Bold will obtain your account information. If you elect to connect an external account to Bold, Bold will obtain limited information from the Connected Accounts sufficient to provide the Service. The specific information Bold obtains may vary by institution and account type. You should assume Bold will obtain from the account any information that is available to you. For example, if you connect a bank account to Bold’s personal finance dashboard tool (described below), Bold can collect any information from the account, including balance and transaction information, such as amount of payments, debits, and deposits. If you connect a loan account at an external institution, Bold can collect loan balance, interest rate on the loan, and your payment history.
* Use of Connected Information. If you elect to connect an account through any Bold service, Bold may use the information from the connected account for any purpose permitted by Bold’s Privacy Policy, including use of the information to identify products and services that may be of interest to you, sharing information with affiliated companies to offer products and services to you, and identifying if you would be likely to be eligible for certain products and services.
* Use of Plaid Services. To connect an account, Bold requires you to use a service offered by Plaid Inc. (“Plaid”). Your use of Plaid’s service is governed by Plaid’s [Privacy Policy](https://plaid.com/legal/#end-user-privacy-policy) and Terms of Use.
* To obtain information from Connected Account, Bold Acts as Your Agent. If you elect to connect an external account to Bold, Bold will connect to the account and obtain information at your direction and as your agent. Bold does not warrant that the information obtained from the external account is accurate, complete, or non-infringing. In addition, Bold will not be liable for the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of any information that you manually input or otherwise submit for purposes of using the Service, including any services offered by third-party vendors or business partners, such as Plaid.

2\. Bold’s Personal Finance Dashboard Tool. If you use Bold’s Personal Finance Platform Tool service, the following terms and conditions also apply to you.

Bold offers personal tools to view, aggregate, and manage your information from multiple accounts. The information compiled includes accounts held at Bold and at external financial institutions, such as a bank account or a loan serviced by another institution. Bold offers these tools under the product name brand of “Personal Finance Dashboard Tool”.

Bold’s Personal Finance Dashboard Tool is intended to only provide organizational and planning services for your financial information.

3\. Bold’s Points Program. If you participate in Bold’s Points Program (the “Program”) whether through your Bold Debit Card or through the Site, the following terms and conditions also apply to you.

* Program Overview. The Program is a free membership-based program offered exclusively by Bold to our membership located in the United States. Individuals who meet the Eligibility Requirements (defined below) and who become members of our Service (“Members”) can earn Program points (“Points”) by engaging in certain “Eligible Activities” including, but not limited to, using Bold’s Service and making purchases with your Bold Debit Card. Please visit our Site for a complete description, including any additional terms and conditions, of the most current Eligible Activities and the process to earn Points.
* Program Rules. These terms and conditions (“Program Rules”), which include all additional policies such as our Privacy Policy, Terms of Use, Bold Debit Card Rewards Program Terms and Conditions, and other policies found on our site (collectively, “Additional Program Terms”) and any other terms and conditions referenced and incorporated herein, all of which may be amended from time-to-time, contain information about the relationship between us with respect to the Program. By participating in the Program, you acknowledge that you have read, understood and unconditionally accept to be bound by the Program Rules. We reserve the right to modify, delete or otherwise change any of the terms and conditions in the Program Rules in our sole and absolute discretion, without further notice or compensation to you, and you waive any right to receive specific individual notice of such modifications. We reserve this right even if such changes affect the value of any Points (defined below) already accumulated. This means that we may make changes that affect, but are not limited to, how to enroll and how Points are earned or used. This also means that we may terminate the Program, or any benefit of the Program, or substitute the Program for a similar or different program at any time. Any updates to these Program Rules will be effective immediately upon posting on our Site, and your continued participation in the Program constitutes your acceptance to such modifications. These Program Rules constitute a legally binding agreement between us. Accordingly, you expressly represent and warrant that you are eligible for the Program (as described below) and will otherwise comply with these Program Rules. If you do not agree to all of the Program Rules now or at any point in the future or you become ineligible for the Program, please contact us to un-enroll.
* Eligibility. Subject to the Bold Debit Card Rewards Program Terms and Conditions (for those Members with a Bold Debit Card), this Program is open to all Bold account holders who are residents of the United States (excluding Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam) who have reached the age of majority in their state of residence. The Program is void where prohibited or restricted by law.
* Points.
    * General. Bold may offer Points to Members for participation in Eligible Activities. Points have no cash value, even if they accrue based on cash spent. Points are not your property and have no property value. Points are issued without separate payment or other consideration by you and exist at the sole discretion of Bold as part of the Program. Points cannot be purchased or sold, redeemed for cash or credit or any other monetary value or currency, or used to pay debts. Points may not be assigned, transferred, traded or pledged to any third party, except as expressly authorized by Bold. Points cannot be transferred by operation of law, such as by inheritance, in bankruptcy or in connection with a divorce. Points that are sold, transferred or assigned may be rescinded or confiscated at Bold’s discretion. Points will be available only to the owner of the Bold account and only if the Member engages in an Eligible Activity. Disputes as to the owner of the Bold account will be decided by Bold in its sole and absolute discretion.
    * Earning Points. Members may earn Points by participating in Eligible Activities, which include using Bold’s Service and making purchases with your Bold Debit Card. In order to receive Points, the individual participating in Eligible Activities must be the Member and registered owner of the Bold account. A complete list of Eligible Activities is available on our site. The list of Eligible Activities and the Points that are awarded for those transactions may change from time to time in Bold’s discretion without notice. Bold reserves the right to modify, suspend, or terminate the Program or any aspect thereof at Bold’s sole discretion. Changes may include, but are not limited to, adjustments to earning rates, redemption values, Eligible Activities, or the accrual or redemption of Points. Notice of such changes will be provided in accordance with applicable laws.
    * Points Credits. Points will be credited to your account within 30 days after completing an Eligible Activity. The award transaction date can in some circumstances differ from the earn transaction date. Bold reserves the right to rescind or adjust at any time any pending or available Points that were awarded in connection with this Program. Points earned through fraudulent activity, sham, inaccurate reporting, mistake or falsified information may also be rescinded by Bold. Points can be accessed on your Bold account dashboard our site. If you believe you did not receive the correct amount of Points for an Eligible Activity, you must contact the Bold Customer Team within ninety (90) days of completing the Eligible Activity. Bold will make the final determination, in its sole and absolute discretion, as to whether Point adjustments of any kind are justified.
    * Promotional Points. From time to time, Bold may offer opportunities to earn Promotional Points that are subject to Additional Program Terms (“Promotional Points”). All applicable Additional Program Terms associated with the specific promotional offer must be met in order to earn Promotional Points. Promotional Points will be posted to your Bold account within 30 days after the end date of the applicable promotion, unless otherwise specified in the promotion-specific Additional Program Terms. Promotional Point offers are not redeemable for cash and are void where prohibited by law.
    * Points Expiration. Bold Points do not expire. However, modifications or changes to the Program, including termination of the Program, may impact an account holder’s ability to earn or redeem Points. Bold reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to amend, modify, or alter the expiration policy, including but not limited to, instituting an expiration period for Points. Notice of such changes will be provided in accordance with applicable laws.
    * Points Transfers. Bold may make available a tool to allow Members to transfer Points to other Members by completing a Points transfer application. To be eligible to receive a Points transfer, the recipient Bold account must be activated and the recipient Member’s primary email address must match the email address entered into the Points transfer application by the sending Member. As a Member, in the event of a Points transfer, you agree that your personal information such as your email address may be shared and used for purposes of completing the Points transfer process. Bold may set limits to the number of times Points can be transferred or to the number of Points that can be transferred. Transferred Points will be immediately removed from the sending Bold account and credited to the recipient Bold account. Points transfers are final, nonrefundable and nonreversible. Bold may rescind or confiscate Points and suspend the Bold accounts of any Members who are suspected of using the Points transfer tool in a manner inconsistent with these Terms or to sell, purchase, trade or barter Points.

* Program Modification and Termination.

* General. We may modify, amend, cancel, delete, change or terminate the Program or any of the Program Rules and Additional Program Terms in any manner at any time in our sole and absolute discretion, including but not limited to terms applicable to Eligibility Requirements, Points, or any other aspect of the Program. These modifications may affect Points already received, including Point value. We will provide notice of modification of these Program Rules by posting revisions to these Rules at our site and updating the last modified date. If required by applicable law, we will additionally send notice of the modifications to you at an email address we have on file. Modifications to these Program Rules are effective immediately when posted. You agree that each time you access your Account or otherwise use or participate in the Program you are accepting and agreeing to be bound by the then-current Program Rules. You are responsible for remaining knowledgeable as to any changes that we may make to these Program Rules and should therefore review the Program Rules each time you use or access the Program. If you do not agree to be bound by the Program Rules as modified, your only recourse is to cancel your Account and your failure to do so constitutes your continued acceptance of these Program Rules.
* Notice of Changes to Program Rules. We may, but are not required to, send notice to Members to advise them as to Point forfeiture or Program updates, modifications or changes. We will not be liable for failing to notify a Member of such changes, modifications or forfeitures, or for problems of any kind with any of the programming or equipment associated with or utilized by a Member, or for any human error or any disruption, interruption, deletion, omission, defect or line failure of any telephone network or electronic transmission, or for problems related to computer software, equipment, inability to access any website or online service, or any other technical or non-technical error or malfunction, or for lost, late, stolen, illegible, incomplete, unintelligible, misdirected or damaged mail or email.
* Termination of the Program. While the Program has no predetermined end date, we may terminate the Program at any time, with or without notice.
* Invalidity. If any provision of these Program Rules is invalid or unenforceable, all remaining provisions hereof will remain in full force and effect. The failure of us to exercise any of its rights under these Program Rules does not constitute a waiver of such rights in any other instance.

* Account Access and Member Communications. You may access your account, including your membership activity, Points balance and view the most current Program information and Program Rules on our site. By participating in the Program, you agree and acknowledge to receive emails related to the Program, including Program updates, and promotional email offer updates from us.
