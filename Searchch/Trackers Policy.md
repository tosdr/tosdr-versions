#### Introduction

We use various common technologies in order to collect, store, and analyze data when you use our Services. This specifically includes cookies that can be used to identify your browser or device.

Where required under applicable law (such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation and/or other EU privacy laws, if applicable), we will ask you for your consent to our use of cookies that are not strictly necessary for the provision of our website and services ("Non-Essential Cookies") when you first visit our website.

#### About cookies

**What is a cookie:** A cookie is a small file that is sent to your computer or is stored automatically on your computer or mobile device when you call up one of our services. When you call up a service again, it can recognize your browser or your device using the cookie. Cookies can store user settings and other information. Along with what are called ‚Äúsession cookies‚Äù which are automatically deleted after a visit to our services, we also use temporary and permanent cookies that remain stored on your computer or mobile device for a longer period.

**Why we use cookies and other tracking technologies:** The cookies used on our website primarily serve to provide you with the functionalities of our various services conveniently and securely (for instance, logging in to your user account). In addition, the information collected using cookies makes it possible for us to improve our Services according to customer desires, and to provide offers and advertising customized to you.

In addition to cookies, we can also make use of other technologies (e.g., pixels, web beacons, tags, advertising IDs) in order to analyze the use of our services, to personalize our services, and to display offers and advertising customized to you. For instance, when we send newsletters and e-mails, we can use technologies that allow us to analyze what content is interesting to users and whether, when, and how they react to our offers (e.g., by downloading pictures in an e-mail, clicking on URLs in an e-mail or on a website, filling in form data, etc.).

Finally, we use various common web analysis and tracking tools to measure and evaluate the use of our services. Such tools, which are usually provided by third parties, provide us with information and statistics on the use of our services that help us to better understand the use of our Services and to adapt them to User needs accordingly.

For example, we use Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google LLC and Google Ireland Ltd. Google Analytics likewise uses cookies.

Full IP addresses are only transferred to a Google server in the USA and shorted there in exceptional cases. Google will use this information to evaluate the use of the corresponding website, to compile reports about the website activities, and to provide additional services to the website operator related to the website use and Internet usage.
