**Use Of Financial Content Is At User’s Own Risk**

These investment vehicles may consist of common stock, options, convertibles, bonds and mutual funds, software, media, and services (collectively, the “Financial Content”; together with the IP content, the “Content”).

**Warranty & Liability Disclaimers** 
-------------------------------------

Value Line disclaims all express and implied warranties, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, compatibility, security, suitability, reliability, availability, accuracy, non-infringement, and usefulness, with respect to the Value Line Services and the Content. We shall not be liable for any errors or omissions in the Content. We shall not be liable for any loss or damage that may result from its use or non-performance. The Value Line Services and all Content are provided “as is” and on an “as available” basis without warranties of any kind, either expressed or implied. These can include warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. Neither Value Line nor any of its Licensors (1) , suppliers, or vendors warrants that the Value Line Services and Content will be accurate, complete, uninterrupted, or free of other harmful components.

IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH ANY PORTION OF THE WEBSITES OR ANY OF THESE TERMS, EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO DISCONTINUE USING THE WEBSITES AND SERVICES.

**Limitation of Liability**
---------------------------

 To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event and under no circumstances shall Value Line and its affiliates be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, punitive or consequential damages. These damages may include loss of revenue, lost business, lost profits, or lost sales. Whether foreseeable or not, we are not liable for damages from your use of any Value Line Services or Content that result from mistakes, omissions, interruptions or deletions of files, errors or defects in the Value Line Services or Content, delays in operation, transmission or failure of performance. Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, this limitation may not apply to you. If you are dissatisfied with any of the Value Line Services or Content, or with any of the terms and conditions, your sole and exclusive remedy is to discontinue using the Value Line Websites and Services.

**Value Line Investment Survey** 
---------------------------------

Officers, directors, and employees of Value Line, and EULAV Asset Management (“EULAV”), may hold stocks that are reviewed or recommended in the Value Line Services. EULAV also manages investment companies and other accounts that use the rankings and recommendations the Value Line Services. These accounts, the officers, directors, and employees of Value Line may dispose of a security notwithstanding the fact that The Value Line Investment Survey (“The Survey”) ranks the issuer favorably. Conversely, such accounts or persons may purchase or hold a security that is poorly ranked by The Survey. Some of the investment companies managed by EULAV only hold securities with a specified minimum Timeliness Rank by The Survey and dispose of those positions when the Timeliness Rank declines or is suspended. Additional rank-related information is made available internally. Value Line’s portfolio managers also may have access to publicly available information. This can result in or influence a change in rankings or recommendations, such as earnings releases, changes in market value, or disclosure of corporate transactions. The investment companies or accounts may trade upon such information prior to a change in a ranking. While the rankings in The Survey are intended to be predictive of future relative performance of an issuer’s securities, The Survey is not intended to constitute a recommendation of any specific security. Any investment decision with respect to any issuer covered by The Survey should be made as part of a diversified portfolio of equity securities and in light of an investor's particular investment objectives and circumstances.

The arbitration award shall be final and binding on the parties. The award may be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction over the parties or their assets, wherever located.
