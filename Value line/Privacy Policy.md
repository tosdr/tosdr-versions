• you have provided us with your consent to do so as explained above;  
  
• we are required to do so in order to comply with a United States or an EU legal obligation or to enforce our rights and defend claims; and/or

As we continue to develop our business, we may undergo a business transition such as acquiring another company, merging with an existing company, or selling a portion of our assets. In such transitions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.
