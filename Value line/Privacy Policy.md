------------------------------------------------

We are able to legally collect and use your personal information either because:

• you have provided us with your consent to do so as explained above;  
  
• we are required to do so in order to comply with a United States or an EU legal obligation or to enforce our rights and defend claims; and/or  
  
• collecting and using your personal information is necessary for us to:  
  
  (a) process any purchases made by you via our Website; or  
  (b) carry out our legitimate business interests in order to carry out any requests or orders made by you via our Website.

* obtain confirmation from us that your personal information is being collected and used by us and to access the personal information held about you by us;
* have your personal information corrected if it is inaccurate or incomplete at any time;
* erasure, or the right to be forgotten, which means that you can request the deletion or removal of any personal information we hold about you at any time, understanding this may prevent us from providing Value Line services to you;
* block or suppress us collecting and using your personal information, which means we can continue to store your personal information but we cannot further collect or use it in any way;
* obtain and reuse any personal information we hold about you for your own purposes across different services, which allows you to move, copy or transfer your personal information easily from Value Line to another place notified by you to us in a safe and secure way without hindrance to the usability of your personal information; and

As we continue to develop our business, we may undergo a business transition such as acquiring another company, merging with an existing company, or selling a portion of our assets. In such transitions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. In the unlikely event that Value Line or substantially all of its assets are acquired or are subject to court proceedings relating to the sale or acquisition of the business, you acknowledge that such transfers may occur and that your personal information can continue to be used as set forth in this privacy policy.
