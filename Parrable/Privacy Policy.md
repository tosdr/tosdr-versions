### Identity without Third-Party Cookies

Parrable’s patented identification solution does not leverage third-party cookies, does not employ browser fingerprinting or probabilistic methods and does not use authentication or other user provided data (e.g. hashed email addresses, logins).

### Identify without Data Leakage

Publishers decide with whom Parrable’s ID will be shared, and what information will be shared with it. Inquire to learn more about Parrable’s Private Audience offering.

### Identify without compromising Consumer Privacy

Parrable is the most consumer privacy and consent progressive of any ID platform. Parrable is not a data broker and does not share information with third parties. Parrable encrypts every ID so that no bad actors can leverage the identity, fixing the uncontrollable tracking issue of cookies. Parrable remembers each consumer’s consent preferences for each publisher, across all device browsers and apps, no other identity solution can universally remember this. Parrable also does not leverage emails or other private data that wasn’t meant to be shared for device identity.

What companies are saying...

#### Andrew Baron

##### VP Marketplace and ML

"We are committed to curating the leading independent identity providers on behalf of our global publishers and buyers. Parrable’s consent-based, privacy-friendly technology is an integral part of the solutions we believe can help our customers thrive on the path to the addressable future."

#### Patrick McCann

##### VP Data Science

"After deep evaluations of many of the players in the newly forming identity space in adtech, it is clear to me that Parrable has unique technology and is one of the most promising solutions to the growing addressability challenges the industry is facing."

#### Chris Beck

##### Product Manager

"Parrable's technology allows for the identification of users in cookieless environments. Unlike other common IDs created using an email hash, a log-in is not needed to create the identifier. Parrable will provide addressability for a majority of the web where users are not logged-in (at least 70% and likely more) when device identifiers go away."
