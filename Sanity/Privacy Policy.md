Privacy Policy
==============

This is the Privacy Policy of Sanity AS and Sanity US Inc. ("Sanity"). For Sanity, the protection and confidentiality of your data is of the utmost importance.

Sanity collects and uses your personal data strictly within the legal limits of the data protection law of the Kingdom of Norway, the EU General Data Protection Regulation no. 2016/679 and UK GDPR (collectively, the "GDPR") as incorporated in Norwegian law, in addition to applicable data protection laws in the United States, including but not limited to, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”). Terms that we use in this document like "personal data", "processing", "data controller" and "data processor" shall have the meaning as defined therein.

We may modify this Privacy Policy at any time. All changes will be effective immediately upon posting to our website. Material changes will be conspicuously posted on our website or otherwise communicated to you. The latest version of the Privacy Policy is always accessible at www.sanity.io/legal/privacy.

**1\. Personal Data We collect**

**1.1 Log in information and data you provide as a customer of sanity.io**

In order to use all services offered by Sanity, you are required to register. You may register using third party identity providers, such as Google and Github. If you choose to do so, the identity providers will provide Sanity with your name, email address and profile picture (if available). Sanity will not, however, have access to your password. If direct signup with Sanity is provided, we will require you to enter your name, email address and password, and you may also provide us with other information upon login, such as your profile picture. For both options, this data is required to create and administer a user account for you and to enable you to use the service. For enterprise customers, Sanity allows signup and login via third party enterprise authentication services, if previously agreed upon and formalized in terms with said enterprise.

If you decide to use services offered by Sanity that are subject to a charge, you are required to provide the name, address, email address, and phone number of your organization (or yours if not applicable) for payment reasons. This information is also processed by our payment processor. Credit card information is never available to Sanity, but is only transmitted to and stored with our payment processor.

To provide you with a better service, user and organization data may also be stored in third-party CRM systems or similar tools (such as e.g. hubspot.com and salesforce.com) for sales and marketing purposes.

You may choose to download our published whitepapers or sign up for our newsletter and service status updates provided via email. We will store your name and email address, and use this information to send you marketing communications. We will also share this information with third party vendors to deliver these services on our behalf. You may choose to unsubscribe from these email communications at any time. We will also very occasionally send important service updates to all registered users via email, using the same third-party vendors.

Sanity is the data controller for the personal data of our service users according to relevant data protection law.

**1.2 Information within content owned by our users at sanity.io**

Users can upload a variety of content, such as texts, images, videos and music files to and via the Sanity Services, defined as "Customer Data" in our General Terms and Conditions. Typical content uploaded to Sanity might be news articles or a shop's production information. This data may occasionally, but not usually, contain data that may be qualified as personal data. In this context, Sanity is only a processor of data on behalf of the user and not the data controller. Sanity will only process and store this data within the framework of the provision of the service, in the scope described in the General Terms and Conditions and our Agreement with you or the entity with which you are connected to.

**1.3 Data collected through the use of APIs and SDKs**

Sanity allows customers to integrate their uploaded content into their internal systems and/or third-party systems delivered by other parties through an Application Programming Interface (API). Sanity by design does not determine what systems it may be configured to interoperate with but typical examples of classes of such systems are content delivery (e.g. HTML rendering systems, native mobile applications, digital signage systems) and content optimisation (e.g. e-commerce personalization services, A/B/N-testing or similar) systems.

The SDKs can, however, be configured by the user/client of our service to send the identity (user ID) of logged-in users to our APIs in order to facilitate, for example, access control. This would be a user-based decision/parameter defined by client and therefore out of our control.

Sanity logs the originating IP address of an end user to avoid fraudulent use (e.g., denial of service attack).

**1.4 Information gathered through automatic data collection**

When you access the Sanity Services via a browser, the Command Line Interface (CLI), or other means, certain data is automatically transmitted for technical reasons. The following data is logged and stored separately from any other data you may transmit to us for a limited time: IP address, date and time of access, browser type and version, operating system, URL of the website visited prior to ours, amount of data transmitted, performance numbers such as latencies and caching, and any data regarding how you use and interact with the Sanity Service and its features. This data is collected for Sanity’s legitimate business purposes, including for testing, development, operation of the Sanity Services, security, and troubleshooting.

Logged-in users will also transmit authentication information through cookies or headers to allow our systems to authenticate and authorize the request and make decisions based on the logged-in user. This information is never stored together with the access logs mentioned above, but other information that is explicitly provided by the user to perform operations may, however, be logged and associated with the user in order to provide audit logs and similar.

When visiting our website at sanity.io we collect aggregate statistics about your actions on our website and store these with a third-party processor for analytics and statistics to improve our website and service. The collected data does not include any personal information, and it is not possible for us to trace this back to any individual.

If the user should encounter any errors while using our services, we will temporarily log information relevant to the error, including the information listed above, with a third party processor in order to notify us of the error and aid with debugging.

**California’s “Do-Not-Track” Requirement. we currently do not respond to “do not track” requests.**

Sanity uses Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager, web analytics services provided by Google for aggregate statistics about our website usage. This also collects information for remarketing purposes. The information gathered is anonymous, and cannot be traced back to individuals. To learn more about how Google uses data, visit [Google’s Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy) and Google’s page on “[How Google uses data when you use our partners’ sites or apps.](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners)” You may download the [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) for each web browser you use, but this does not prevent the use of other analytics tools. To learn more about Google Analytics cookies, visit [Google Analytics Cookie Usage on Websites](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/cookie-usage).

When users visit Sanity.io they may choose to opt-in to seeing advertising about Sanity elsewhere on the internet. Sanity uses Google Marketing Services to allow more targeted ads for our website on sites using Google Display Network and Google Search Ads. The user data is processed pseudonymously by Google Marketing Services.

**2.2. Third Parties/Service Providers We Share Personal Data With**

We may share all categories of personal data listed above with the following categories of third parties and/or service providers:

**Employees and Affiliates.** We may share personal data with our employees and affiliates who have a need to know the information for our business purposes.

**Third Parties and/or Service Providers.** We may share personal data with third parties and/or service providers that provide services for us as set forth below.

**Government Officials / Law Enforcement.** We will cooperate with law enforcement and other governmental agencies, and may disclose personal data: (i) if we believe in good faith we are legally required to disclose that personal data, (ii) if we are advised to disclose personal data by our legal counsel, or (iii) when necessary to identify, contact or bring a legal action against someone who may cause or be causing harm to, or interfering with the legal rights of, Sanity or any other party.

**Professional Advisors.** We may share personal data with our professional advisors, such as our attorneys, accountants, financial advisors and business advisors, in their capacity as advisors to Sanity.

**Change in Ownership.** In the event (a) Sanity is subject to a change of control, (b) our services change ownership, in whole or in part, or (c) of a bankruptcy, receivership or a similar transaction, we may provide personal data to the subsequent owner(s), including as part of any due diligence process.

**Other.** We may share personal data with third parties and/or service providers when explicitly requested by or consented to by you, or for the purposes for which you disclosed the personal data to us as indicated at the time and point of the disclosure (or as was obvious at the time and point of disclosure).

**2.3 Third party access to your data**

Sanity employs third-party processors under contract as part of providing our services to you, who may process your personal data in cases where we are the data controller. In these cases, we only share the necessary information to enable them to carry out their tasks. Such external service providers are carefully selected in order to ensure your privacy and to fulfil our obligations under the GDPR, CCPA, and other applicable data protection laws. Service providers may only use the data for the purposes under the agreement entered into between Sanity and the service provider. More information about our specific third-party processors is included at [https://www.sanity.io/third-party-sub-processors](https://www.sanity.io/third-party-sub-processors). Adequate safeguards for transfers to our subprocessors are in place, including data processing agreements compatible with EU standard clauses accepted by the European Commission.

Sanity will notify customers before changing subprocessors that have access to customer-controlled data, and allow the customer to cancel their contract before the switch if they object.

Personal data may be shared with law enforcement agencies, public bodies and third-party victims' claims based upon court orders or other binding orders from public bodies. Any such transfers of data will be made in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

**2.4 Deletion of your data**

Your data will be deleted from our systems and third-party processors once it is no longer required for the aforementioned purposes. We delete or anonymize logs within 90 days of collection. If you delete your user account, your personal data will be removed from our systems without unreasonable delay, and at the latest within 90 days, unless applicable legislation or legal process prevents us from doing so. To the extent that Sanity is legally obliged to archive data, such data will be blocked and will not be available for productive use.

Customer-controlled data may be deleted via our API. We retain a complete history of all changes to a dataset, including deleted documents, with a maximum retention period given by the project's plan. Custom retention periods can be configured for the entire dataset or by document type for customers with our custom history retention feature. Customers can also permanently delete a document and all history via a purge mutation through our API. Note that user-specified document IDs will be retained in our systems indefinitely (until the entire dataset is deleted), for technical reasons - we strongly recommend that document IDs never contain personal or sensitive data. Deleted assets may remain available in public CDN caches until the configured expiry time.

Data may in certain cases remain in the systems of our subprocessor Google Cloud Platform for as long as 180 days, as outlined in their terms of service, although it will generally be removed much sooner. This data is not available to us.

**2.5 Location of your data**

Sanity relies on the Google Cloud Platform as a subprocessor to store collected Personal Data and your uploaded content. Personal data is stored in our EU datacenter. Uploaded content will be stored in the EU/EEA, the US, or in regions where Sanity has an operational footprint, specific by customer. For serving purposes, data may be stored transiently or cached in any country in which Google Cloud or its agents maintain facilities.

**2.6 California Residents**

This Section applies to our collection and use of “Personal Information” if you are a resident of California, as required by the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 and its implementing regulations, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CCPA”).

**2.7 Individuals located in the EU, EFA and UK**

_Legal Bases for Processing Personal Data_

If you are an individual located in the European Union (EU), European Economic Area (EEA) or United Kingdom (UK), we collect and process Personal Data about you where we have a legal basis for doing so under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR, where “Personal Data” has the definition set forth in the GDPR and UK GDPR. This means we collect and process your Personal Data only when:

* it is necessary for a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your individual privacy interests),
* you have consented to this collection and processing for a specific purpose;
* it is necessary to fulfil our contractual obligations; or
* it is necessary to comply with a legal obligation.

Where we rely on your consent to process your Personal Data, you have the right to withdraw or decline consent at any time.

Where we rely on our legitimate interests to process your Personal Data, you may have the right to object. More information on exercising this right can be found in Section 2.9 below (“How to Exercise your Privacy Rights”).

_Transfers, Storage, and Processing_

Personal Data that we collect or receive may be transferred to and/or processed by third parties that are located outside of the EU, EEA, or UK, some of which EU, EEA and UK authorities may not consider to have an adequate level of protection for personal data. Sanity will only transfer Personal Data to third parties located outside of the EU, EEA, and UK when it has ensured appropriate safeguards for such Personal Data through use of the standard contractual clauses or other approved methods by the EU, EEA, and UK.

_Unresolved Complaints_

If your inquiry with us has not been satisfactorily addressed, or if you believe we are processing your Personal Data not in accordance with the law or this Notice, you may file a complaint with the supervisory authority in your country of residence.

| Automated Decision Making | The right to request information about the logic involved in automated decision-making and a description of the likely outcome of processes, and the right to opt out. Sanity does not currently engage in any automated decision-making practices. |
| Opt Out of Sale Sharing | The right to opt out of the sale or sharing of personal data. |

Shine the Light. Pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1798.83, if you are a California resident, you have the right to obtain: (a) a list of all third parties to whom we may have disclosed your personal information the past year for direct marketing purposes, and (b) a description of the categories of personal information disclosed, by contacting us at [privacy@sanity.io.](mailto:privacy@sanity.io.)

**2.9 How to Exercise Your Privacy Rights**

To exercise your rights under applicable data protection law, please submit a request to us by contacting us at [privacy@sanity.io.](mailto:privacy@sanity.io.)

Only you or an authorized agent may make a verifiable consumer request. You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access twice within a 12-month period. The request must:

* Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information/Personal Data or an authorized representative of that person; and
* Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate and respond to it.

We must verify your identity before fulfilling your requests. If we cannot initially verify your identity, we may request additional information to complete the verification process. We will only use Personal Information/Personal Data provided in a request to verify the requestor’s identity. If you are an authorized agent making a request on someone else’s behalf, we will also need to verify your identity, which may require proof of your written authorization or evidence of a power of attorney.

We endeavor to respond to requests within the time period required by applicable law. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.

Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period prior to the date we receive the verifiable consumer request. The response we provide will also provide the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.

We will not discriminate against you in the event you choose to exercise any of your privacy rights.
