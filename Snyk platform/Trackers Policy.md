As a global company, Snyk adheres to the General Data Protection Regulation (“EU GDPR”) and the UK General Data Protection Regulation (“UK GDPR”, together with the EU GDPR “GDPR”).

* Contract. We may process your personal information to execute a contract with you or your employer. 
    
* Legal Compliance. We may process your personal information to comply with our legal obligations. 
    
* Legitimate Interest. Where it is necessary for us to process the information in order pursue our legitimate interests, including: 
    
    * providing and improving our products and services; 
        
    * maintaining the security and integrity of our offerings; 
        
    * minimizing claims and financial losses for us, and our customers; 
        
    * promoting our products, services and brand; and
        
    * conducting research and analytics.

**International Transfer.** Because Snyk is an international business, we may need to transfer your personal information out of the UK, EEA or Switzerland to other countries. We only transfer your information if (1) the recipient is in a country providing an adequate level of protection; (2) we use appropriate safeguards, such as standard contractual clauses; or (3) there is an applicable exception (such as consent). Please contact us at [privacy@snyk.io](mailto:Privacy@snyk.io) if you would like additional information regarding the international transfer of your personal information.

If you are in the UK,  you may submit a complaint to the Information Commissioner's Office (“ICO”) ([**www.ico.org.uk**](https://www.ico.org.uk/)); however, we request that you first give us an opportunity to address your concerns before you contact the ICO.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the last twelve months we have collected the personal information identified in the “[What personal information does Snyk collect?](https://snyk.io/policies/privacy/#What-personal-information-does-Snyk-collect)” section of this notice. 

We do not intentionally collect sensitive personal information, as defined in the California Consumer Privacy Act. If you provide us with such information, we will only use that information for purposes permitted by California Civil Code section 1798.121(a) and the related regulations. 

We allow (and in the last 12 months we have allowed) trusted partners to collect personal information - namely internet or network activity - on your activity on our Platform in order to provide you with more useful, targeted advertisements. California considers that to be selling or sharing your information for targeted advertising. Although we do not currently respond to Do Not Track signals, we do provide other options for you to request that we do not sell or share your personal information. To opt-out of sharing or sale of your information follow the instructions in the “[What rights do I have concerning my personal information?](https://snyk.io/policies/privacy/#What-rights-do-I-have-concerning-my-personal-information)” section of this notice. 

We do not have actual knowledge that we sold or shared personal information concerning minors—those under 16 years of age.
