2. If you have a paid subscription, this Agreement shall remain in effect for the initial period stated on the Order Form and thereafter, will renew automatically for additional twelve (12) month periods until terminated by either you or us providing the other with notice of termination prior to the end of the Term (all such periods together referred to as the “Term”).

To the extent that your Order Form specifies any of those Services as being included in your subscription, the relevant additional Service-Specific Terms form part of these Terms of Service and apply additionally to your use and our provision of those Services.

You shall ensure that the maximum number of Developers shall not exceed your Subscription Allocation. You may purchase additional Developer subscriptions in increments of 10 by notifying us or through the self-service function on your account and paying additional fees. We may track the number of Developers to verify that you are paying for the correct number of subscriptions and invoice you for any additional fees due.

1. If you choose a paid-subscription plan, you agree to pay us fees in accordance with the relevant pricing plan. Details of those fees are set out on our Pricing Page at https://snyk.io/plans (which do not include VAT).
    
2. Depending on the pricing plan chosen by you, our third party payment processor will (and you hereby authorise it to) bill your payment card for the applicable fee in advance on or shortly after the date you subscribe for a paid plan and each month or anniversary thereafter, until terminated by you or us. The fees are non-cancellable and non-refundable, except as expressly stated otherwise in these Terms of Service.
    
3. If you move to a higher tier of a paid plan, the change will take effect immediately and we will charge you for the additional fees associated with the new paid plan on a pro-rata basis. If you move to a lower tier of a paid plan, the fee change will take effect in the next billing cycle. You acknowledge that you will not receive a refund for the then-current billing cycle if you move to a lower tier of a paid plan, or to a non-payment subscription plan.

6. You will pay fees without any set-off, counterclaim, deduction or withholding of any kind, except as may be required by law.

**Schedule  - Additional Terms for certain Services**
-----------------------------------------------------

**The following additional terms apply in respect of Snyk License Compliance Management:** Snyk License Compliance Management is the function of the Services which enables you to create sets of rules that can be applied in respect of License Information applicable to the Protected Asset. “License Information” means the license information identified by the Services as being associated by the Snyk License Compliance Management with any dependency in or content of the Protected Asset.

You acknowledge and agree that: 

1. License Information is obtained by Snyk from the licensor of the relevant software reviewed using Snyk License Compliance Management, or the code repository by means of which that software is made available;
    
2. No warranty or representation of any kind is made by Snyk as to the accuracy or completeness of License Information, or the availability of License Information for any Protected Asset, and that License Information is made available ‘as is’ at your own risk;
    
3. You are responsible for determining the extent to which certain license types present a legal or commercial risk to you, including any risk posed by a ‘copyleft’ or reciprocity requirement in any license, and configuring the Snyk License Compliance Management accordingly; and
    
4. You are responsible for setting your own severities or permissions by means of Snyk License Compliance Management, and any sample or default license policy made available for use by Snyk is solely for information purposes and not intended as legal advice or advice applicable to your own circumstances and risk assessments.
    

**The following additional terms apply in respect of Snyk Infrastructure as Code.** Snyk Infrastructure as Code is a function which enables you to scan configuration files and settings associated with Protected Asset and set and manage preferences. “IaC Information” is information regarding configuration associated with the Protected Asset, produced by means of Snyk Infrastructure as Code.

You acknowledges that: 

1.  No warranty or representation of any kind is made by Snyk as to the accuracy or completeness of, or the availability of IaC Information for any Protected Asset, and that IaC Information is made available ‘as is’ at your own risk;
    
2. You are responsible for determining the extent to which any apparent security configuration issues identified by Infrastructure as Code present a security or other risk to you; and
    
3. You are responsible for determining your own response to any apparent security configuration issues identified by Infrastructure as Code, and any sample or default security configuration policy made available for use by Snyk is solely for information purposes and not intended as legal advice or advice applicable to your own circumstances and risk assessments.
    

**The following additional terms apply in respect of the API**. The “API” is the application program interface made available by Snyk to you as an optional part of the Services for the purposes of connecting your Snyk account with other facilities operated and controlled by you. You may use the API during the Term, solely for the purposes of your use of the Services for your internal business operations. No warranty or representation is made as to the API’s continued availability, or its compatibility with any software or technical protocols or standards. 

The API is intended to be used as an interface between the Platform and an external application or repository operated and controlled by you. Snyk may rate-limit, throttle or otherwise restrict API use to prevent what it considers (in its absolute discretion) to be abuse, security issues or excessive use. Snyk shall use reasonable endeavours when applying such restriction to return a descriptive error message, but the nature of the restriction may make this impractical. 

**The following additional terms apply in respect of CLI tool**: the “CLI tool” is the Snyk client-facing code, more particularly described in the Documentation, which authenticates a machine with a particular Snyk account. Snyk’s CLI tool reports to Snyk an event for each command you issue, including, but not limited to, the version of the CLI tool, the versions of surrounding tools such as Node, Maven, Bundler and npm, the  organization ID, the arguments and inputs provided to the CLI, and details about duration, success and failure of CLI actions. This information is used by Snyk for analytical purposes and to improve the Services. It allows Snyk to better understand how the CLI tool is used, and informs Snyk’s product development decisions.

You hereby agrees to Snyk’s collection and use of data as described in this section.
