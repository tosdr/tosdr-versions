 **DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION.**

**PLEASE READ CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS.**

(A). Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to any SodaStream product including, but not limited to, claims of personal injury and/or property damage, shall be submitted to arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance to its then existing Consumer Arbitration Rules. The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org, or by calling the AAA at 800.778.7879.   The Federal Arbitration Act (Title 9 of the U.S. Code) shall govern the interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings relating to this arbitration.

(B). Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. It uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. By agreeing to arbitration, the parties understand and agree that they are waiving their rights to maintain other available resolution processes, such as a court action or administrative proceeding, to settle their disputes.

(C). Any claim shall be brought only in the party's individual capacity, and shall not in any case be brought by the party as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.

(D). A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice"). The Notice to SodaStream should be addressed to SodaStream's Corporate Office located at 136 Gaither Dr, Ste 200, Mount Laurel, NJ 08054 ("Notice Address"). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought. If an agreement to resolve the claim is not reached within 30 days after the Notice is received, any party may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by a party shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.

(E). There shall be one arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have the power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including, but not limited to, any objections with respect to the existence, scope, or validity of the arbitration provision or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim.   The arbitrator's award shall be binding on all parties, and judgment upon the award may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction.

 **APPLICABLE LAW**

By using any SodaStream product or SodaStream Service you agree that the substantive law of the state of Delaware and applicable federal law will govern in the event of a dispute between you and SodaStream any disputes.

 **MODIFICATION, AND SEVERABILITY**

We reserve the right to make changes to our site, policies, and these Conditions of Use at any time. If any of these conditions shall be deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, it shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining condition.

**WAIVER**

If you breach these Conditions of Use and we take no action, we will still be entitled to use our rights and remedies in any other situation where you breach these Conditions of Use.

If you breach any of the Conditions of Use, and SodaStream elects not to enforces its rights against you, such a waiver by SodaStream shall NOT be deemed to be, or construed as, a further or continuing waiver of any such breach, or a waiver of any other term, covenant, or SodaStream’s rights as contained herein,

SodaStream - Product Review Policy
----------------------------------

**1\. Introduction**

SodaStream encourages its customers to provide genuine feedback regarding their SodaStream product purchases.

This policy sets out how customers can submit reviews of SodaStream’s products through the SodaStream website [sodastream.com](https://sodastream.com/), as well as how we verify and moderate these reviews. However, this policy does not apply to product reviews which are not submitted through the SodaStream website (e.g. reviews made through third parties such as Google, Amazon or Facebook, which may have their own review policies).

**2\. How to submit reviews of our products**

If you purchase a product through the SodaStream website, you will be sent an email to the email address that you used in your online order asking for feedback on your product. This email will contain a link to submit a review of your product through the SodaStream website. Reviews which are submitted this way will be tagged as 'Verified Buyer' reviews on the SodaStream website, as we are able to verify that the review has come from someone who purchased our product.

If you purchased your SodaStream product from somewhere other than the SodaStream website, you can still submit a review through the 'write a review' function on the SodaStream website. As part of submitting a review this way, you will receive an email to confirm your email address. Email confirmation proves that the review was written by an actual person and was not generated by a bot. Reviews which are submitted this way will not be tagged as 'Verified Buyer' reviews, but as ‘Verified Reviewer’ reviews.

When you submit a review, you will be required to provide certain information, including your name, email, title, a 'star rating' out of five and your comment / feedback on the product. Your data will be handled according to our [sodastream.com/blogs/legal/privacy-policy](https://sodastream.com/blogs/legal/privacy-policy). If your review is published, only your first name, last initial, star rating and comment / feedback will be displayed on the SodaStream website (i.e. your full name and email will not be published).

**3\. How do we moderate online reviews for publication?**

Reviews will be moderated before they are published on the SodaStream website to check they are relevant to the product that is reviewed and are not offensive or otherwise inappropriate to publish. SodaStream reserves the right to not publish reviews which it reasonably considers:

* \-contain profanities or explicit language/materials;
* \-are otherwise offensive, defamatory, libelous, harassing, abusive, vulgar, violent, hateful, obscene, political in nature or otherwise inappropriate, including with respect to race, gender, sexuality, ethnicity or other personal characteristics;
* \-contain personally identifiable, private or confidential information;
* \-are spam, automated, fake, false, misleading or deceptive;
* \-are irrelevant to the product being reviewed;
* \-are repetitive (e.g. multiple reviews submitted by the same customer in respect of the same product purchase);
* \-infringe intellectual property rights (including publicity rights);
* \-contain software viruses or alike; or
* otherwise should not be published due to legal / regulatory reasons.

SodaStream will aim to publish on the SodaStream website all genuine reviews which comply with this policy within 14 days of submission. We may also share your review on our social media and/or other marketing materials.

If your review is not published on the SodaStream website when you believe it should have been, please let us know by sending an email to [no-reply@shop.sodastream.com](mailto:no-reply@shop.sodastream.com).
