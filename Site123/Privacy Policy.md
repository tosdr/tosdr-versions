### **2.3 Data from Collaborative Sources**

Additionally, when you sign up or log in using a social media account, we may gather information from that platform, like your username or basic profile details.

This information is employed exclusively within the context of enhancing or delivering these services. Examples include:

**3\. Why We Collect**
======================

Our main objective in collecting your personal information is to offer you seamless access to various sections of our website, manage your subscription billing, and keep you informed about alterations to your account and the services we offer.

Additionally, we might reach out using your contact details to share updates regarding our platform, as well as curated content that aligns with your interests. Should you prefer not to receive such promotional messages, there's always the option to unsubscribe by following the instructions in the promotional emails we send.

We employ a mix of both specific and generalized data to delve deeper into understanding our user base – discerning how they interact with our platform and identifying potential avenues for enhancement. These insights not only provide us with a clearer picture of our audience's preferences and the popularity of our offerings but also gauge the success rate of our marketing strategies. While we refrain from revealing this specific data, we might disclose a generalized version that does not pinpoint individual users, like in the form of trend analyses. The essence of collecting this information is to constantly refine our platform, ensuring that we cater to your unique needs and preferences. In summary, we gather information to:

* Analyze user behaviors and demographics
* Elevate the overall user journey on our site
* Recommend tailored content and services
* Update our audience on the latest offerings and promotional content
* Seamlessly execute transactions and deliver our services.

  

**4\. How We Collect**
======================

We collect information by fair and lawful means, with your knowledge and consent. We also let you know why we’re collecting it and how it will be used. You are free to refuse our request for this information, with the understanding that we may be unable to provide you with some or all of your desired services without it.

  
**5\. Disclosure of Personal Information**
=============================================

While we integrate third-party services for various needs such as analytics, user authentication, and advertising, we prioritize safeguarding your personal details. Unless you grant us explicit permission, identifying information remains confidential. On occasion, to enhance our services, external consultants may be granted limited access to our data. Yet, we remain firm in our commitment to not share your information with unrelated parties, barring specific scenarios like court orders or potential legal repercussions stemming from your activities within our system. In such situations, the data may be disclosed in line with a court mandate or to parties alleging harm.

For analytical and service improvement purposes, we might grant select external consultants and agencies restricted access to our data. This access is always time-bound and task-specific. We ensure collaborations are only with entities whose privacy practices resonate with ours. Moreover, entities handling payment processing might interact with our data strictly for task completion. We neither provide them any personally identifiable information without your clear approval nor allow them to use our data for other intentions.

In cases where government or law enforcement agencies request data, we critically evaluate the relevance and scope of such demands. If a request appears overly broad or misaligned with its declared objective, we may deny it. Nonetheless, if complying is deemed necessary—for instance, to uphold legal mandates, safeguard our rights and assets, protect public safety, deter crime, or avert potential illegal or unethical conduct—we may cooperate. Outside these contexts, we firmly refrain from sharing, selling, or renting your personal details to any third party or marketers.

Before collaborating with any third-party provider, a thorough review of their privacy protocols is undertaken. We strictly engage with those whose standards align with ours, ensuring you're never unknowingly exposed to services that might jeopardize your privacy.

  

**6\. Location and Management of Your 'Personal Information'**
==============================================================

The personal information we gather is primarily stored and processed in the United States, but it may also reside in locations where our partners, affiliates, or third-party providers operate. Given our role as a global website builder platform, it's possible for your data to be transferred to, and accessed from, various international locales. Regardless of where the data resides, our dedication to its security and your privacy remains unwavering.

We strictly transfer data across regions that have data protection regulations aligning with our dedication to safeguarding our users' privacy.

Our practice is to retain personal and business information only as long as it's essential for service delivery or for future service enhancements. Throughout its retention, we employ commercially viable means to safeguard the data against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, it's pertinent to note that no electronic storage or transmission method is entirely foolproof. While we strive for optimal data security, we cannot assure its invulnerability. We only keep personal data for as long as necessary for our services or its improvement.

  

**7\. End-Users’ 'Personal Information'**
=========================================

As a website proprietor, you have an obligation to clearly communicate to your visitors how their data is being handled on your site. When incorporating third-party applications or services, it's crucial to verify their compliance with GDPR. Specifically, if you integrate any applications or services, such as those from our app market \[https://www.site123.com/app-market\], it falls on you to ensure they meet GDPR standards (https://gdpr-info.eu). Furthermore, it's essential to disclose to your users how these third-party tools might process their data.
