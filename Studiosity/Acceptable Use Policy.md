Acceptable Use
--------------

Rest of the World United Kingdom and EU Canada SY-0-20170320

This acceptable use policy sets out the terms between you and us under which you may access our website studiosity.com and its related domains (our site). This acceptable use policy applies to all users of, and visitors to, our site.

Your use of our site means that you accept, and agree to abide by, all the policies in this acceptable use policy, which supplement our terms of use.

studiosity.com is a site operated by Studiosity Pty Ltd (ABN: 41 114 279 668) (“we”).

### Prohibited uses

You may use our site only for lawful purposes. You may not use our site:

* In any way that breaches any applicable local, national or international law or regulation.
* In any way that is unlawful or fraudulent, or has any unlawful or fraudulent purpose or effect.
* For the purpose of harming or attempting to harm minors in any way.
* To send, knowingly receive, upload, download, use or re-use any material which does not comply with our content standards (outlined below).
* To transmit, or procure the sending of, any unsolicited or unauthorised advertising or promotional material or any other form of similar solicitation (spam).
* To knowingly transmit any data, send or upload any material that contains viruses, Trojan horses, worms, time-bombs, keystroke loggers, spyware, adware or any other harmful programs or similar computer code designed to adversely affect the operation of any computer software or hardware.

You also agree:

* Not to reproduce, duplicate, copy or re-sell any part of our site in contravention of the provisions of our terms of use
* Not to access without authority, interfere with, damage or disrupt:
    * any part of our site;
    * any equipment or network on which our site is stored;
    * any software used in the provision of our site; or
    * any equipment or network or software owned or used by any third party.
* That you grant to Studiosity the irrevocable right:
    * to use any submitted content and data relating to or derived from your use of the Services, once suitably anonymised and/or aggregated, including for the purpose of developing and improving the Services or developing alternative services;
    * to use any feedback provided, or proposals or suggestions made by you, once suitably anonymised and/or aggregated, for improvement of the Services or for the development of alternative services; and
    * to publish de-identified content or de-identified data relating to your use of the Services for promotional purposes.

### Interactive services

We may from time to time provide interactive services on our site, including, without limitation:

* One-to-one personalised learning.
* Chat rooms.
* Bulletin boards.
* Writing feedback.

By using the services you agree any advice given is on a best endeavours basis. Studiosity and our education partners expressly exclude liability for your academic results as a result of using the services.

Where we do provide any interactive service, we will provide clear information to you about the kind of service offered, if it is moderated and what form of moderation is used (including whether it is human or technical).

We will do our best to assess any possible risks for users (and in particular, for children) from third parties when they use any interactive service provided on our site, and we will decide in each case whether it is appropriate to use moderation of the relevant service (including what kind of moderation to use) in the light of those risks. However, we are under no obligation to oversee, monitor or moderate any interactive service we provide on our site, and we expressly exclude our liability for any loss or damage arising from the use of any interactive service by a user in contravention of our content standards, whether the service is moderated or not.

The use of any of our interactive services by a minor is subject to the consent of their parent or guardian. We advise parents who permit their children to use an interactive service that it is important that they communicate with their children about their safety online, as moderation is not foolproof. Minors who are using any interactive service should be made aware of the potential risks to them.

Where we do moderate an interactive service, we will normally provide you with a means of contacting the moderator, should a concern or difficulty arise.

### Content standards

These content standards apply to any and all material which you contribute to our site (contributions), and to any interactive services associated with it.

You must comply with the spirit and the letter of the following standards. The standards apply to each part of any contribution as well as to its whole.

Contributions must:

* Be accurate (where they state facts).
* Be genuinely held (where they state opinions).
* Comply with applicable law in the State of New South Wales and in any other Australian State and in any country from which they are posted.

### Suspension and termination

We will determine, in our discretion, whether there has been a breach of this acceptable use policy through your use of our site. When a breach of this policy has occurred, we may take such action as we deem appropriate.

* Immediate, temporary or permanent withdrawal of your right to use our site.
* Immediate, temporary or permanent removal of any posting or material uploaded by you to our site.
