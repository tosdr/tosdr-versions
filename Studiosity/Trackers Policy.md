Our Privacy Commitment
----------------------

Studiosity Pty Limited A.C.N. 114 279 668 trading as "Studiosity" is committed to managing personal information openly and transparently and to keeping personal information safe. We will take all necessary measures to fulfill this commitment, including to:

* comply with the Australian Privacy Principles ("APPs");
* ensure that we manage personal information openly and transparently;
* only collect personal information that we need in order to provide our services and properly undertake our business;
* be open and honest about how we might use personal information;
* confirm if we need to disclose personal information to anyone else (including anyone overseas) and if so, in what circumstances this might occur;
* keep personal information secure;
* promptly respond to any request not to receive direct marketing material from us;
* make sure personal information is kept accurate and up to date and to properly dispose of any personal information which is no longer required by us; and
* ensure that, where appropriate, individuals can access and correct their personal information.

### About this Policy

This policy is intended to explain clearly and in plain language some of the key processes and procedures that we have implemented to manage personal information, to protect the privacy of individuals and to comply with the Privacy Act 1988 ("Act") and the Australian Privacy Principles.

References to "our", "us" and "we" in this policy are references to Studiosity.  “End-User” means a person who uses the Studiosity service (“Service”).

This policy gives a broad overview of our policies in relation to privacy but if you require further information, you are welcome to contact us.

You should read this privacy and cookie policy before providing us with any personal information, before using the Service and prior to us providing any services to you. By providing personal information to us, by using the Service or by requesting that our services are provided to you, you are confirming your agreement to the policies and procedures described in this privacy and cookie policy.

### What sorts of personal information do we collect?

We will only collect information that is necessary and relevant to the proper undertaking of our business.

The types of personal information we collect may include name, email address (including personal email, institution email and parental email), mobile phone number, year of study, date of birth, postcode, student status, entity/institution name, type of entity/institution (e.g. school, library, university), business address, ACN/ABN, details of sporting and other extra-curricular commitments (if required to assist with scheduling). We may also collect additional information from End-Users in order to improve our services and performance.

Where our clients are students and their families, we will also collect credit card and/or other payment information (which may also include home address details).

The information we collect will depend on the exact nature of the services that we are providing and what information is reasonably required to provide those services.

The Act places additional restrictions on us collecting sensitive information (which includes information about religion, political views, ethnicity, criminal records and sexual preferences). Generally we will not collect this type of information, however we may need to collect some sensitive information in circumstances where a person is applying for a job with us, and consent has been provided to us to do so.

### Why do we require personal information?

There are various reasons why we might need to collect, hold, use or disclose personal information and this will depend upon the specific service that we are providing.

Usually, the main reason that we will need to collect End-Users’ personal information will be to provide our services to you. Our main services relate to the provision of individualised, one-to-one tuition services to students and families in circumstances where these students and families are either our direct consumer clients or are the end users ("End Users") of our commercial clients (being schools, tertiary institutions, other educational institutions, libraries and corporations). Our tuition services will include assisting students with homework/study, assignment research, study skills, revision and exam preparation by providing students with a forum with our subject specialists for discussion, feedback and responses in respect of study queries and other aspects of their study. Our services are primarily delivered through the Internet.

We may also use personal information for other reasons, including:

* to prevent fraud and other criminal activities;
* to assist us to run our business and to improve our services and performance, including setting up our services, understanding the year level of students, understanding the progress of, and services required by students, staff scheduling, staff training, accounting, risk management, record keeping, archiving, systems development, marketing, developing new services and products (if applicable), undertaking planning, research and statistical analysis (for example, to ascertain the aggregate number of users in a geographical area);
* to provide customer and technical support;
* to comply with our legal obligations; and
* for marketing purposes.

There is no obligation to provide personal information for use by us but if you do not provide us with the personal information that we require, we may not be able to provide the information or services that you require.

### How do we collect personal information?

The means by which we collect personal information will depend on the nature of the service being provided.

We may collect personal information:

1. directly from the individual;
2. when you access and interact with the Service (including audio recordings and transcripts of calls with End Users);
3. when you complete the online signup process;
4. when you access the Service via a third-party software platform
5. from our commercial clients who have obtained the express consent of their individual clients or customers (i.e. the End User) to disclose their personal information to us for its relevant use, including for use in our business and to provide our services;
6. from publicly available sources, for example, the electoral role, the telephone directory or from other websites; or
7. from other sources.

We will collect personal information directly from the relevant individual where ever possible.

Where we are collecting personal information, we will remind you of this policy at the time of collecting that personal information.

In these circumstances, we will only hold onto such information where the information is necessary for our functions and activities. If we determine that the information received is not necessary for our functions and activities then we will take steps to de-identify or destroy the information as soon as is practicable. Any determination as to whether or not the information is required to be retained by us will be made within a reasonable period after the information is received by us. Any information that has not been requested but is subsequently retained by us will be subject to the procedures and requirements set out in this privacy and cookie policy.

Studiosity will also share information regarding the usage of its services by its End Users with its commercial clients by way of a monthly report. Where commercial clients (such as universities, schools etc.) have purchased a licence to use our services, those commercial clients will have access to, and knowledge of the usage patterns of their students. Such usage patterns will include the content of student learning sessions and any comments left in post-session surveys. We may also share transcripts and audio recordings with our commercial clients for the purpose of quality control of our services.

By agreeing to accept the terms of this privacy and cookie policy and in providing personal information to us, you are taken to have consented or obtained the necessary consent to have personal information used or disclosed for the above purposes.

At the time that we collect personal information, we will make it clear why we are collecting personal information. We will not use personal information for any other purpose without consent or where we do use information for another purpose, it will either be for a purpose which we believe is related to the purpose for which it was first provided to us or for a purpose which would be expected.

We may also provide personal information to third parties as outlined below.

Other than the above, we will not disclose personal information without consent unless disclosure is either necessary to prevent a threat to life or health, authorised or required by law, reasonably necessary to enforce the law or necessary to investigate a suspected unlawful activity.

### Do we share personal information with others?

We may share your personal information with other companies that are necessary to the provision of the Service. By providing personal information to us, you confirm that consent has been obtained to share the personal information with other such companies.

We deal with third party service providers who may assist us with a variety of functions including with marketing, research, mail and delivery, security, insurance, professional advisory (including legal, accounting and auditing advice), banking, payment processing, credit reporting or technology services. Where we engage third party service providers to perform services for us, those third parties may be required to handle personal information. Under these circumstances, those third parties must safeguard this information and must only use it for the purposes for which it was supplied and we will make all reasonable enquiries to try to ensure that this is the case.

We will limit personal information provided to independent third parties to that information required for those third parties to properly perform their functions. Further, our contracts with these third parties will always require the third parties to comply with the APPs (or equivalent standards).

### Do we use personal information for marketing purposes?

As part of the services that we provide, we may:

1. use personal information that we have collected to identify a Studiosity product or service that may benefit a particular person or group of people;
2. contact individuals from time to time to let them know about a Studiosity product or service that we believe might be of interest to them; and

By providing personal information to us, you consent, or confirm that consent has been obtained, to include the personal information in our database to be used for the purposes described above, however, an individual can opt-out, unsubscribe or make a request not receive marketing communications from us by writing to us by email at privacy@studiosity.com. Additionally, each marketing communication, including all emails and SMS, will include an opt-out or "unsubscribe" option which will immediately indicate to us that the person opting-out or unsubscribing no longer wishes to receive materials of this kind. If a request is made not to receive marketing communications from us, we will stop sending these materials.

We do not use personal information for public relations purposes without prior consent.

### How do we store and protect personal information?

We have implemented appropriate processes and techniques (including physical security such as locks and security systems and computer and network security, including firewalls and passwords) to protect personal information from loss, misuse and interference and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. In addition, access to personal information is limited to those who specifically need it to conduct their responsibilities.

We and our third party service providers take all necessary steps to destroy or permanently de-identify personal information where it is no longer required and to protect personal information from loss, misuse and interference and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.

While care is taken to protect personal information, unfortunately no data transmission over the Internet is guaranteed as 100% secure and no computer system is completely without risk of penetration by unauthorised persons, or other unauthorised access. Accordingly, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information sent to us or received from us online. This is particularly true for information sent to us via email as we have no way of protecting that information until it reaches us. Once we receive personal information, we are required to protect it in accordance with the Act.

### Maintaining personal information

We take reasonable steps to ensure that:

1. the personal information that we collect about is accurate, complete and up-to-date at the time of collection;
2. when we use personal information, it is accurate, up-to-date, complete and accurate at the time of use; and
3. if we disclose personal information, it is accurate, up-to-date, complete and accurate at the time of disclosure.

### Will we disclose personal information to anyone overseas?

There may be circumstances where we need to disclose your personal information to a third party overseas ("Overseas Recipients"). This may occur, for example, where we have a database or server hosted outside Australia or where you are interacting with an application that is based overseas. Prior to us disclosing your personal information to an Overseas Recipient, we have an obligation under APP 8.1 to take reasonable steps to ensure that the Overseas Recipient does not breach the APPs (the "Overseas Disclosure Obligations").

We will take all reasonable steps to satisfy our Overseas Disclosure Obligations.

### How can personal information be accessed?

Usually we will be able to provide access to personal information upon receipt of a written request. Such a request can be emailed to privacy@studiosity.com or can be sent by post to Studiosity, Level 1, 11 Chandos Street, St Leonards NSW 2065 Australia, together with confirmation of the person's identity. There are some limited circumstances in which we may not be able to provide access to personal information when requested. Such circumstances might include where access would pose a serious threat to the life, health or safety of another person or where such access would unreasonably impact on the privacy of others.

Where a request is made for access to personal information, we will respond to any such request within a reasonable period after the request is made and if possible, we will provide access to the personal information in the manner requested, if specified. In any event, we will take all reasonable steps to provide access to your information in a way that meets the needs of the individual making the request.

If we deny access to personal information for any reason, or if we are unable to provide access to personal information in the manner requested, then we will provide a written notice confirming:

1. the reason for such refusal; and
2. the procedure to complain about the refusal.

We may recover our reasonable costs of supplying access to personal information but we will not charge for any request to access personal information.

### How can you seek to correct personal information?

We do what we can to ensure that the personal information we hold is accurate, complete, up-to-date, relevant and not misleading. To assist us to do this, please ensure that you provide us with correct information at the time you provide it to us and immediately inform us if any details change at any time. If we are concerned that any personal information is inaccurate, incomplete, out-of-date, irrelevant or misleading, or if a request is made that we correct any personal information, then we will take all reasonable steps to correct the information to ensure that it is accurate, complete, up-to-date, relevant and not misleading in the context of the purpose for which it is held.

If we correct any personal information and that information has previously been disclosed to another entity that is required to comply with the APPs, then, upon receipt of a request to do so, we will take reasonable steps to notify that other entity of the correction unless such notification is impracticable or unlawful.

If we refuse to correct personal information following a request to do so, then we will provide a written notice confirming:

1. the reason for such refusal; and
2. the procedure to complain about the refusal.

If we refuse to correct personal information following a request to do so and a request is made that we associate with the information a statement that the information is inaccurate, out-of-date, incomplete, irrelevant or misleading then we will take reasonable steps to associate the statement with the information so that the statement is apparent to users of the information.

We will respond to any requests regarding the correction of personal information within a reasonable period after the request is made.

We will not charge for any request to correct personal information, nor will we pass on any costs incurred by us in correcting personal information or for associating a statement with personal information.

### What if you want to make a complaint about some aspect of our privacy procedures?

We are committed to maintaining and protecting the privacy of individuals but it is possible that in limited circumstances, mistakes might be made.
