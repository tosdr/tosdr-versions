7\. Brigit’s Services & Fees
----------------------------

### 7.1. Overview of Brigit’s Free Features

As a baseline, Brigit offers several no fee products to its users. These products include tools to track your income and expenses, and alerts about estimated upcoming bills and other expenses. Brigit will monitor your Bank Account and notify you when your Bank Account balance is in danger of being overdrawn and, in turn, help you avoid overdraft fees.

### 7.2. Brigit Subscription Memberships (Additional Features)

In addition to the free features, Brigit may be able to provide you with certain premium features available through a paid subscription membership. Brigit has two levels of paid memberships. Brigit Plus provides users access to advanced analytical & budgeting tools, credit monitoring, and, if eligible, direct integration with Brigit’s Advance service. Brigit Premium provides all of the features of Brigit Plus as well as access to Credit Builder.

Grandfather Provision: Brigit Plus members who subscribed to Brigit Plus before the effective date of June 5th, 2023 shall continue to have access to Credit Builder loans. This provision will be in effect until and unless the grandfathered user connects a new linked bank account after June 5th, 2023.

#### 7.2.1. Subscription Membership Fee for Premium Features

Brigit Plus is subject to a subscription fee that ranges from $5.99 to $9.99 per month. Brigit Premium is subject to a subscription fee of $14.99 per month. We require that you link a Bank Account or debit card (a “Payment Method”) for payment of the Membership Fee (the subscription fee). We will automatically charge your Payment Method for the Membership Fee every month on your last payday of the month unless or until you cancel your membership or your Brigit User Account is otherwise terminated. Upcoming dates upon which you will be charged for subsequent Membership Fees will also be displayed in the app.

Brigit will do its best to collect the Membership Fee when you have the funds available to pay the Membership Fee. Brigit will attempt to avoid charging you for your Membership Fee if we detect that your Payment Method does not have sufficient funds to cover the charge. If our attempt to charge you for the Membership Fee is declined, Brigit reserves the right to try again for up to 14 business days.

If payment is being made via debit card, we may try at different times of the day in accordance with network regulations. If the payment is made via ACH, we will make up to two (2) additional attempts, for a total of three (3) debit attempts in line with ACH limitations. After that, Brigit will not attempt without a subsequent authorization from you. This may result in a change of date for which you are billed for each period.

Brigit monitors your balance and does its best effort to ensure you have sufficient funds before debiting your account, but the company makes no warranties that an overdraft will not occur.

The Membership Fee may be discounted from time to time by our customer service team, or through partnerships with affiliates. The discounted price will be for a limited time which will be disclosed to you at the time the discount is given.

#### 7.2.2.Credit and Debit Authorization For Brigit Subscription Membership

Consistent with Section 7.2.1, if you enroll in a Brigit Subscription Membership, you authorize Brigit to electronically debit your Payment Method for the Membership Fee once each month. As applicable, you also authorize Brigit to electronically debit and credit your Payment Method to correct erroneous debits and credits. You have the right to receive notice of any debit for the Membership Fee that would vary in amount from a previous Membership Fee, but you agree that we only need to notify you in advance if a particular debit from your Payment Method would be more than $9.99 for Brigit Plus or $14.99 for Brigit Premium. (Our policy is that no single debit will exceed $9.99 or $14.99 depending on your membership type, so we expect not to provide you with advance notice of each ongoing debit from your Payment Method.)

You acknowledge that, as applicable, the electronic authorization contained in this Section represents your written authorization for automated clearinghouse (“ACH”) transactions as provided herein and will remain in full force and effect until you notify Brigit that you wish to revoke this authorization by emailing [\[email protected\]](https://www.hellobrigit.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). You must notify Brigit at least three (3) business days before the scheduled debit date in order to cancel this authorization. When you call or email, please include the name and telephone number associated with your Brigit User Account. Failure to provide correct and complete information may make it impossible for Brigit to stop withdrawal of the preauthorized withdrawal.

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Brigit from and against any loss incurred as a result of its withdrawal of a preauthorized debit transaction from your Bank Account or debit card if any of the information relied upon in your request to stop payment is incorrect or incomplete. If you have followed the instructions in this section to notify Brigit of your desire to revoke your authorization at least three (3) business days before the scheduled debit date, Brigit will be liable for your losses or damages directly caused by our failure to stop any preauthorized transaction. If we do not receive notice at least three (3) business days before the scheduled debit date, we may attempt, in our sole discretion, to cancel the transaction. However, we assume no responsibility for our failure to do so.

You warrant and represent to Brigit that you have the right to authorize us to charge and credit your Bank Account or debit card for payments due to us under this Agreement.

You represent that you are capable of saving or otherwise storing a copy of this electronic authorization for your records, and the credit and debit transactions you request comply with applicable law.

### 7.3. Credit Monitoring Service

You may opt-in to use the credit monitoring service offered by a third-party provider, Array.

Use of Brigit’s Instant Cash (Advance Service) product does not affect your credit score.

Brigit will not store the information on its servers nor will it request this information unless authorized by an individual to do so.

### 7.4. Credit Builder Service (“Credit Builder”)

The Brigit Credit Builder (included in the Brigit Premium membership) is a service provided by Brigit and its bank partner, Coastal Community Bank, Member FDIC, to help you improve your credit scores. The Brigit Credit Builder product is separate from the Brigit Advance service. Section 7.4 is applicable only for the Brigit Credit Builder service. Brigit Credit Builder installment loans and lines of credit are issued by Coastal Community Bank, Member FDIC, subject to approved underwriting practices.

#### 7.4.1. USA PATRIOT ACT and Customer Identification Program Notice for Credit Builder

To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, US Federal law requires all financial institutions and companies like ours to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person identified as a “customer” who opens an account.

This means if you apply for a Brigit Credit Builder Account, we may ask you for your name, date of birth, street address, identification number (like a Social Security Number), and any other information that will allow us to identify you as the customer on the account. We may also ask to see a driver’s license, passport or other identifying documents.

We may share the information you have provided us to our banking partner, Coastal Community Bank, Member FDIC, in connection with opening and maintaining an account for you. We may also provide the information you have provided us to Array and its representatives.

If your identity cannot be verified, we may not be able to open an account for you. In the event we have accepted any funds from you in connection with an account application or otherwise, you will be responsible for providing us a mailing address to which payment of any refund can be sent.

#### 7.4.2. Customer Consent to Credit Builder Account Information

If you apply for and receive a Credit Builder Account from Coastal Community Bank, Member FDIC, you hereby consent to us accessing the account information related to your Credit Builder Account with Coastal Community Bank, Member FDIC. You acknowledge and agree that the account information that we may access includes, without limitation, account history (such as payment dates and amounts, balance information, and transaction information); financial account information (such as account number, type, and status); and financial account holder information (such as the account holder’s name, address, phone number, and email address). We will request this information from Coastal Community Bank, Member FDIC, on a periodic basis, unless your consent is withdrawn.

#### 7.4.3. Monthly Payments

You hereby agree to make monthly payments on your credit builder loan by an electronic funds transfers. You may initiate these payments each month yourself or you may authorize automatic monthly payments and Coastal Community Bank, Member FDIC, will initiate monthly electronic funds transfers from your designated account at Coastal Community Bank, Member FDIC, or your Brigit Linked Bank Account. Each month, the debit amount would include your Monthly principal payment. You may also use another payment option that we approve in writing (e.g. a form of payment that we identify and approve through direct communication with you. You can contact us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.hellobrigit.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)).

#### 7.4.4. Potential Effect of Delinquency of Credit Reporting

Repayment performance for the Brigit Credit Builder will be reported to the Credit Reporting Agencies by Coastal Community Bank. Brigit shall not be liable for any claims, charges, demands, damages or adverse impacts on your credit scores or credit history if you cease using Brigit’s services and do not complete a loan repayment or have default payments. Repayment performance for the Brigit Advance service is not reported to the Credit Reporting Agencies.

#### 7.4.5. Dispute of Credit Reporting Information by Customer

If you believe there is an error in your credit report about the Brigit Credit Builder Service, you may dispute the information by contacting us. We will then conduct an investigation and let you know what we determine.

To file a dispute, email us at [\[email protected\]](https://www.hellobrigit.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) or call us at [+1 (855) 885-5522](tel:+18558855522), with the following information.

* Your name and, if applicable, account number or other identifying information
* The specific information you are disputing
* Your reasons for the dispute
* Any supporting documentation you wish to provide (for example, a copy of your credit report, account statements, or a police report of identity theft)
* Your email address other means for us to contact you with results of our investigation

Once we receive a notice of your dispute, we and our partners will conduct a reasonable investigation and make a determination of the status of the disputed information within 30 days, or, in some cases, 45 days. This investigation is free of charge to you. Once we conclude our investigation we will let you know shortly after if we determined the information was accurate or inaccurate, or whether we need more information from you. If we determine that the disputed information is inaccurate, we will notify the relevant credit reporting agency and request that they delete or modify the information as appropriate.

### 7.5. Advance Service

When you sign up for one of Brigit’s Subscription Memberships, you may elect to receive one or more non-recourse Advances (each, an “Advance”) from Brigit. You can obtain Advances from Brigit in several different ways. Keep in mind that you must qualify for an Advance each time an Advance request is made whether that is through the Autopilot Feature or a manual request.

First, you may choose to enroll in automatic Advances to prevent overdrafts (the “Autopilot Feature”). The Autopilot Feature enables you to automatically obtain an Advance from Brigit when needed. Specifically, if Brigit’s algorithm predicts that you are likely to require funds in order to avoid an overdraft, Brigit’s Autopilot Feature will advance you a preauthorized amount of funds (the “Needed Amount”) to cover your overdraft. You may be eligible for a Needed Amount of up to $250; the Needed Amount for which you are approved will be displayed to you through the Services. Brigit will inform you of any Needed Amount transfer via text message and email. You can turn off the Autopilot Feature within the app at any time.

Second, you may manually request the Needed Amount or an Advance amount less than the Needed Amount from Brigit at any time by selecting the Advance amount and preferred delivery method within the app. Please note that you cannot request an Advance if you already have an Advance outstanding.

#### 7.5.1. When You Will be Charged for Advance Repayment

If you receive an Advance, Brigit will charge your Payment Method for Advance repayment any time after the later of: (a) the due-date displayed to you through the Services when you request the Advance; (b) the due-date chosen by you when extending your due-date within the app; or (c) any time Brigit sees a positive cash inflow into your linked bank account (each a “Preauthorized ACH Repayment”) even if that available cash isn’t enough to pay the full amount owed on the Advance. Alternatively, you may choose to repay your Advance by self-initiating repayment to Brigit via ACH (a “Manual Repayment”). Your Advance is not conditioned on whether you elect to repay via Preauthorized ACH Repayment or Manual Repayment.

Please note that you can always repay an Advance before your due-date for free.

#### 7.5.2. Brigit’s Recourse In the Event of Non-Payment

This Section sets forth the entirety of Brigit’s recourse against you in the event that an Advance is not recovered. Any other recourse or remedies claimed by Brigit, including but not limited to, indemnities, limitations on liability, and disclaimers of warranty described in this Agreement, do not apply to non-payment of an Advance. To the extent that any of recourse-related provision of this Agreement conflicts with this Section 7.5.2, this Section shall control.

Brigit warrants that it has no legal or contractual claim against you based on a failure to repay an Advance, but Brigit will suspend your access to the Services until you repay an Advance in full. With respect to a failure to repay an Advance, Brigit warrants it will not engage in any debt collection activities, place the amount owed with or sell to a third party for the purpose of debt collection activities, or report you to a consumer reporting agency. Brigit may send you an email, text or SMS message reminding you of an upcoming payment, however, such email, text or SMS message should not be construed as a demand for payment.

Brigit does not waive any rights regarding fraudulent activity, and Brigit will pursue instances of fraud.

It is your responsibility to contact Brigit if you are unable to repay your Advance on the scheduled due-date. Brigit monitors your Bank Account balance before withdrawing the funds to ensure there are sufficient funds, but Brigit is not responsible for any overdraft fees, over-the-limit fees, or insufficient fund charges (including finance charges, late fees, or similar charges) that result from your failure to maintain a balance or available credit in your Bank Account sufficient to repay an Advance.

#### 7.5.3. Expedited Delivery and Express Fee

You may request that Brigit expedite disbursement of your Advance by paying an optional fee (the “Express Fee”). While you can always receive an Advance within three (3) business days depending on processing times without additional cost, you may also choose to expedite the delivery if you have your Brigit account linked to your debit card. Brigit will deliver the Advance to you within 20 minutes, and in most instances much faster. There is an express delivery fee (“Express Fee”) for this option. This fee may range from $0.99 – $3.99, depending on the pricing tier of your subscription. The cost of this fee will be disclosed to you when you request an Advance through the Mobile App. You will be given the opportunity to choose between the expedited or normal delivery method at the time you finalize the Advance transaction. The Express Fee is payable at the time you repay the Advance.

#### 7.5.4. California Residents

Brigit is not currently licensed by the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation. If the Department does decide in the future to license Brigit, and/or require Brigit make modifications to its advance pay product agreement, such developments may have no impact on your obligations under this agreement.

Although Brigit is not licensed by the Department, any consumer is invited to share any comment and concerns about Brigit or its product and practices with the Department of Financial Protection and Innovation at (866) 275-2677 (toll-free) or at the following URL: [https://dfpi.ca.gov/file-a-complaint/](https://dfpi.ca.gov/file-a-complaint/).

### 7.6. Obtaining an Advance and/or Credit Monitoring without Paying the Membership Fee

Users that are eligible for Advances and/or Credit Monitoring may access an Advance and/or Credit Monitoring without paying the Membership Fee. To do so, email [\[email protected\]](https://www.hellobrigit.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) and state that you would like an Advance and/or Credit Monitoring without subscribing to one of our Membership plans. You may check whether you are eligible for Advances and Credit Monitoring through the Services.

8\. Authorization & Disclosures for Credit Monitoring
-----------------------------------------------------

### 8.1. Authorization

By registering for or otherwise using the Services, you specifically consent to, agree with, and are providing specific “written instructions” in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act and other applicable law, that we, and our respective employees, agents, subsidiaries, affiliates, contractors, and data and service providers, reserve the right to provide your personally identifiable information to, and request, receive and provide you with your consumer credit reports and credit rating, and other information and data about you from and/or through, an authorized bureau (i.e. Equifax, Experian, TransUnion) and affiliated entities. The credit reports and credit rating are intended to furnish you with information that you may not otherwise have readily available to you. You understand that you are authorizing us and Array to obtain such information at any time and use as described in the Terms of Use for as long as Services are provided to you. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IT MAY BE A VIOLATION OF FEDERAL AND/OR STATE LAW FOR YOU TO OBTAIN A CREDIT REPORT ON ANY PERSON OTHER THAN YOURSELF, AND THAT UNDER THE FCRA, ANY PERSON WHO KNOWINGLY AND WILLFULLY OBTAINS INFORMATION ON A CONSUMER FROM A CONSUMER CREDIT REPORTING AGENCY UNDER FALSE PRETENSES SHALL BE FINED UNDER TITLE 18, UNITED STATES CODE, IMPRISONED FOR NOT MORE THAN 2 YEARS, OR BOTH. Your registration in the Credit Monitoring Service may not be fulfilled if we cannot verify your identity or other necessary information.

### 8.2. FCRA Disclosures

The Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”) allows you to obtain from each national credit reporting agency a disclosure of all the information in your credit file at the time of the request. Full disclosure of information in your file at a credit reporting agency must be obtained directly from such credit reporting agency. The credit reports provided or requested through the Website or Services are not intended to constitute the disclosure of information by a credit reporting agency as required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act or similar laws.

Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act you are entitled to receive an annual free disclosure of your credit report from each of the national credit reporting agencies (i.e. Experian, Equifax and TransUnion).

To obtain the free reports, you can:

* Call 1-877-322-8228;
* Order online at www.annualcreditreport.com; or
* Complete the Annual Credit Report Request Form, available at www.ftc.gov/credit, and mail it to: Annual Credit Report Request Service, P.O. Box 105281, Atlanta, GA 30348-5281.

You are also entitled to receive a free copy of your credit report from a credit reporting agency if:

* You have been denied or were otherwise notified of an adverse action related to credit, insurance, employment, or a government granted license or other government granted benefit within the past sixty (60) days based on information in a credit report provided by such agency.
    
* You have been denied house/apartment rental or were required to pay a higher deposit than usually required within the past sixty (60) days based on information in a credit report provided by such agency.
* You certify in writing that you are unemployed and intend to apply for employment during the sixty (60) day period beginning on the date on which you made such certification.
* You certify in writing that you are a recipient of public welfare assistance.
* You certify in writing that you have reason to believe that your file at such credit reporting agency contains inaccurate information due to fraud.

The FCRA also permits consumers to dispute inaccurate information in their credit report without charge. Accurate information cannot be changed. You do not have to purchase your credit report or other information to dispute inaccurate or incomplete information in your credit file maintained by the credit reporting agencies.

Any Credit Report you request is not intended to constitute the disclosure of information required by the FCRA or similar state laws.

In addition, if you reside in the state of Colorado, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, or Vermont, you are entitled to receive a free copy of your credit report once a year and if you reside in the state of Georgia, you are entitled to receive a free copy of your credit report twice a year. If you are a resident of Mississippi, then beginning in 2016, you are entitled to free credit reports for three (3) years. Otherwise, a consumer reporting agency may impose a reasonable charge for providing you with a copy of your credit report.

9\. Earn Membership & Cash Rewards
----------------------------------

Brigit may, from time to time, offer rewards programs. The specific terms of any such rewards program will be displayed to you through the Services. Brigit reserves the right to cancel, modify or terminate any rewards program at any time.

10\. Cancellation of Brigit Subscription Membership
---------------------------------------------------

If you wish to cancel your Brigit Subscription you may do so on the Brigit website. You may cancel your Brigit Subscription regardless of whether you have an outstanding Instant Cash Advance and you can close your Credit Builder account at anytime with no cost. You must cancel before your subscription is charged in order to avoid billing for the subsequent month. You may also cancel your subscription membership at any time by emailing [\[email protected\]](https://www.hellobrigit.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

11\. Termination
----------------

We, at our sole discretion, reserve the right to terminate this Agreement, terminate or suspend access to the Service, or terminate or suspend your Brigit User Account at any time for any reason. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you of any such suspension or termination unless we terminate your access in accordance with Section 12.2.

You may also terminate this Agreement by deactivating your Brigit User Account at any time by emailing [\[email protected\]](https://www.hellobrigit.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection). If we terminate this Agreement, terminate or suspend your access to the Services, or terminate or suspend your Brigit User Account, we will not be liable to you or any third party for compensation, reimbursement, or damages for any termination or suspension of our services, or for deletion of your information or account data.

13\. Disclaimer of Warranties
-----------------------------

As noted above, through the Services you may receive predictions about your financial situation including, for example, predictions about your likelihood of overdrafting (each, a “Prediction”). You understand and acknowledge that each Prediction merely represents our attempt to predict the relevant facts regarding your Bank Account, that we do not guarantee the accuracy of any such Prediction and that the Services might not predict an overdraft that actually occurs in your Bank Account. Except as expressly set forth herein any use of the Site and the Services, and any decision of yours to act upon any Prediction is your sole responsibility and at your exclusive risk.

20\. Dispute Resolution and Binding Arbitration
-----------------------------------------------

YOU HAVE READ THIS PROVISION CAREFULLY AND UNDERSTAND THAT IT LIMITS YOUR RIGHTS IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND US. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REJECT THIS PROVISION AS PROVIDED IN SECTION 20.3 BELOW.

### 20.1. Election to Arbitrate

You and Brigit agree that the sole and exclusive forum and remedy for resolution of a Claim be final and binding arbitration pursuant to this section 20 (the “Arbitration Provision”), unless you opt out as provided in section 20.3 below. As used in this Arbitration Provision, “Claim” shall include any past, present, or future claim, dispute, or controversy involving you (or persons claiming through or connected with you), on the one hand, and us on the other hand, relating to or arising out of this Agreement, and/or the activities or relationships that involve, lead to, or result from this Agreement, such as the Site or the Services and including (except to the extent provided otherwise in the last sentence of Section 20.8 below) the validity or enforceability of this Arbitration Provision, any part thereof, or the entire Agreement. Claims are subject to arbitration regardless of whether they arise from contract; tort (intentional or otherwise); a constitution, statute, common law, or principles of equity; or otherwise. Claims include matters arising as initial claims, counter‐claims, cross-claims, third-party claims, or otherwise. Please note that you may continue to assert Claims in small claims court, if your Claims qualify and so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. The scope of this Arbitration Provision is to be given the broadest possible interpretation that is enforceable.

### 20.2. Applicability of the Federal Arbitration Act; Arbitrator’s Powers.

This Arbitration Provision is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce and shall be governed by and enforceable under the Federal Arbitration Act (the “FAA”). The arbitrator will apply substantive law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations. The arbitrator may award damages or other types of relief permitted by applicable substantive law, subject to the limitations set forth in this Arbitration Provision. The arbitrator will not be bound by judicial rules of procedure and evidence that would apply in a court. The arbitrator shall take steps to reasonably protect confidential information.

### 20.3. Opt-Out of Arbitration Provision.

You may opt out of this Arbitration Provision for all purposes by sending an arbitration opt out notice to [\[email protected\]](https://www.hellobrigit.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection), **within 60 days of the date of your electronic acceptance of the Agreement of this Agreement**. The opt out notice must clearly state that you are rejecting arbitration; identify the Agreement to which it applies by date; provide your name, address, and social security number; and be signed by you. You may send an opt-out notice in any manner you see fit as long as it is received at the specified address within the specified time. No other methods can be used to opt out of this Arbitration Provision. If the opt out notice is sent on your behalf by a third party, such third party must include evidence of his or her authority to submit the opt out notice on your behalf.

### 20.4. Informal Dispute Resolution.

If a Claim arises, our goal is to learn about and address your concerns and, if we are unable to do so to your satisfaction, to provide you with a neutral and cost effective means of resolving the dispute quickly. You agree that before filing any claim in arbitration, you must submit your claim to Brigit by sending an email to [\[email protected\]](https://www.hellobrigit.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) at any time.You agree that before you are allowed to file a claim for Arbitration that you must allow Brigit 60 days from the time you send your claim to [\[email protected\]](https://www.hellobrigit.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection) to address and cure your specific claim, if possible.

### 20.5. Arbitration Procedures.

The party initiating arbitration shall do so with the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) or Judicial Alternatives and Mediation Services (“JAMS”). The arbitration shall be conducted according to, and the location of the arbitration shall be determined in accordance with, the rules and policies of the administrator selected, except to the extent the rules conflict with this Arbitration Provision or any countervailing law. If you have any questions concerning the AAA or would like to obtain a copy of the AAA arbitration rules, you may call 1(800) 778-7879 or visit the AAA’s web site at: [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/). If you have any questions concerning JAMS or would like to obtain a copy of the JAMS arbitration rules, you may call 1(800) 352-5267 or visit their web site at: [www.jamsadr.com](http://www.jamsadr.com/). In the case of a conflict between the rules and policies of the administrator and this Arbitration Provision, this Arbitration Provision shall control, subject to countervailing law, unless all parties to the arbitration consent to have the rules and policies of the administrator apply. The arbitration will be held in the United States county where you live or work, or any other location we agree to.

### 20.6. Arbitration Fees.

If we elect arbitration, we shall pay all the administrator’s filing costs and administrative fees (other than hearing fees). If you elect arbitration, filing costs and administrative fees (other than hearing fees) shall be paid in accordance with the rules of the administrator selected, or in accordance with countervailing law if contrary to the administrator’s rules. 

We shall pay the administrator’s hearing fees for one full day of arbitration hearings. Fees for hearings that exceed one day will be paid by the party requesting the hearing, unless the administrator’s rules or applicable law require otherwise, or you request that we pay them and we agree to do so. Before we will agree to pay your arbitration hearing fees you must justify to our satisfaction that you are unable to pay these fees.

Each party shall bear the expense of its own attorneys’ fees, except as otherwise provided by law. If a statute gives you the right to recover any of these fees, these statutory rights shall apply in the arbitration notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein.

### 20.7. Appeals.

Within 30 days of a final award by the arbitrator, any party may appeal the award for reconsideration by a three-arbitrator panel selected according to the rules of the arbitrator administrator. In the event of such an appeal, any opposing party may cross-appeal within 30 days after notice of the appeal. The panel will reconsider de novo all aspects of the initial award that are appealed. Costs and conduct of any appeal shall be governed by this Arbitration Provision and the administrator’s rules, in the same way as the initial arbitration proceeding. Any award by the individual arbitrator that is not subject to appeal, and any panel award on appeal, shall be final and binding, except for any appeal right under the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.

### 20.8. No Class Actions.

NO ARBITRATION SHALL PROCEED ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS (INCLUDING AS PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ON BEHALF OF OTHERS), EVEN IF THE CLAIM OR CLAIMS THAT ARE THE SUBJECT OF THE ARBITRATION HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN ASSERTED (OR COULD HAVE BEEN ASSERTED) IN A COURT AS CLASS REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE ACTIONS IN A COURT. Unless consented to in writing by all parties to the arbitration, no party to the arbitration may join, consolidate, or otherwise bring claims for or on behalf of two or more individuals or unrelated corporate entities in the same arbitration unless those persons are parties to a single transaction. Unless consented to in writing by all parties to the arbitration, an award in arbitration shall determine the rights and obligations of the named parties only, and only with respect to the claims in arbitration, and shall not (a) determine the rights, obligations, or interests of anyone other than a named party, or resolve any Claim of anyone other than a named party; nor (b) make an award for the benefit of, or against, anyone other than a named party. No administrator or arbitrator shall have the power or authority to waive, modify, or fail to enforce this Section 20.8, and any attempt to do so, whether by rule, policy, arbitration decision or otherwise, shall be invalid and unenforceable. Any challenge to the validity of this Section 20.8 shall be determined exclusively by a court and not by the administrator or any arbitrator.

### 20.9. Survival and Severability of Arbitration Provision.

This Arbitration Provision shall survive the termination of this Agreement. If any portion of this Arbitration Provision other than section 20.8 is deemed invalid or unenforceable, the remaining portions of this Arbitration Provision shall nevertheless remain valid and in force. If there is a final judicial determination that applicable law precludes enforcement of this Arbitration Provision’s limitations as to a particular claim for relief or particular term, then that claim (and only that claim) or that term (and only that term) must be severed from the Arbitration Provision and may be brought in court. If an arbitration is brought on a class, representative, or collective basis, and the limitations on such proceedings in section 20.8 are finally adjudicated pursuant to the last sentence of section 20.8 to be unenforceable, then no arbitration shall be had. In no event shall any invalidation be deemed to authorize an arbitrator to determine Claims or make awards beyond those authorized in this Arbitration Provision.

### 20.10. Judicial Forum for Claims.

Except as otherwise required by applicable law or governing loan agreement, in the event that this Arbitration Provision is found not to apply to you or your Claim, you and Brigit agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the federal or state courts of New York, New York. Both you and Brigit consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there. We both agree to waive our right to a jury trial.

### 20.11. WAIVER OF RIGHT TO LITIGATE.

THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO LITIGATE CLAIMS THROUGH A COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY, BUT WILL NOT HAVE THAT RIGHT IF ANY PARTY ELECTS ARBITRATION PURSUANT TO THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION. THE PARTIES HEREBY KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVE THEIR RIGHTS TO LITIGATE SUCH CLAIMS IN A COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY UPON ELECTION OF ARBITRATION BY ANY PARTY.

21\. Governing Law and Venue
