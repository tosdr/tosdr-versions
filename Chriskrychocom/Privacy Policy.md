Colophon
========

Or, how this site is made.

[Privacy](#privacy)
-------------------

I also use [Adobe Fonts](https://fonts.adobe.com/) for one of the typefaces on the site (see [below](#typography)), and Adobe tracks font usage. If you find a type-face that has some of the same character as Cronos Pro, [shoot me an email](mailto:hello@chriskrycho.com?subject=Cronos%20Pro%20alternative). I will seriously consider replacing it if I find something I like equally well; I _loathe_ Adobe’s approach to font licensing _and_ to privacy.

Otherwise, there is zero tracking — of any sort — on this site.

[AI](#ai)
---------

None. Not one word of this site was written by a large language model or even with input from one, and that will always be true.

[Implementation](#implementation)
---------------------------------

I built this version of the site with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io/). You can find the entirety of the implementation (and indeed the entire _history_ of the implementation) [on GitHub](https://github.com/chriskrycho/v5.chriskrycho.com). I’m using it with the following plugins:

* **typeset:** my own implementation of a plugin for [typeset](https://typeset.lllllllllllllllll.com/), heavily inspired by [eleventy-plugin-typeset](https://github.com/johanbrook/eleventy-plugin-typeset).
    
* **[markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) plugins:**
    
    * [abbreviations](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it-abbr)
    * [anchor](https://github.com/valeriangalliat/markdown-it-anchor)
    * [definition list](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it-deflist)
    * [footnote](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it-footnote)
    * [implicit-figures](https://github.com/arve0/markdown-it-implicit-figures)
    * [superscript](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it-sup)
* **spacewell:** a little tool I built a few years ago to insert hair spaces around em dashes and thin spaces with non-breaking spans around number-separating en dashes; the source is colocated with the rest of the site.
    

[Typography](#typography)
-------------------------

Perhaps my favorite part of web design, and also the part with which I spend the most part _fussing_.

| Context | Typeface |
| --- | --- |
| Body text | [Sabon](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/sabon/), designed by Jan Tschichold in the mid-1960s as a Garamond revival. In my opinion, the most beautiful Garamond in existence. Licensed via [Fonts.com](https://www.fonts.com/). |
| Headings | [Cronos](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/cronos/), designed by Robert Slimbach in 1996. A nice contrast to Sabon with its digital-era roots. The typeface I’ve been using on my site the longest at this point! Licensed via [Adobe Fonts](https://fonts.adobe.com/).[1](#fn1) |
| Code | [Hack](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/), designed by Chris Simpkins in 2015 as an extension of the Deja Vu/Bitstream Vera lineage. Licensed in parts under the MIT License, the public domain, and Bitstream Vera License (see details [here](https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack/blob/master/LICENSE.md)). |

[Inspiration](#inspiration)
---------------------------

While working on this design, I took more-or-less-direct inspiration in a variety of ways from some of my favorite current or previous designs around the web:

* [Tim Brown](https://tbrown.org/)
    
* [Ethan Marcotte](https://ethanmarcotte.com/)
    
* [Trent Walton](https://trentwalton.com/)
    
* [Craig Mod](https://craigmod.com/) — a truly wonderful site, but I actually loved the _previous_ design iteration even more.
    
* [Jen Simmons](https://jensimmons.com/) — as with Mod’s current site, I really like what she’s doing on her site now — it’s all sorts of fun layout-wise — but it’s quite distinct from what she was doing when I was stealing ideas from her late in 2018!
    
* [Reda Lemeden](https://redalemeden.com/)
    
* [Jason Santa Maria](http://jasonsantamaria.com/) — from whom, if I recall, I originally got [the idea](https://v4.chriskrycho.com/2019/my-final-round-of-url-rewrites-ever.html) of a versioned website.

[Notes](#footnotes)
-------------------

1. Longtime readers may recall (and new readers may be curious about) my [deep frustrations with this situation](https://v4.chriskrycho.com/2019/cronos-follow-up.html). Nothing there has changed — but I ended up paying for Adobe’s Lightroom package when I [picked back up photography](https://v4.chriskrycho.com/2019/photography-ing-again.html), and it comes bundled. So here we are. [↩︎](#fnref1)
