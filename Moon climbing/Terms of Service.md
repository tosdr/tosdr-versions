Terms and Conditions
====================

#### DISCLAIMER

Climbing on artificial climbing structures is by its very nature a potentially hazardous activity and one with different objective dangers to outdoor climbing. You should not rely solely on the information contained on this site. It is essential you receive proper training from a suitably competent person when using or installing any of our products. By reading this warning you accept full responsibility for your own actions and the consequences of those actions. The site owners make no warranty, expressed or implied, with respect to the accuracy of the information, opinion or statement contained herein. If you find any mistakes on this site then please accept our apologies and notify us. We will do whatever we can to correct the information. MoonClimbing.com makes no claim or representation and accepts no responsibility regarding the quality or nature or reliability of the sites accessible by hyperlinks from this website, or sites linking to this website.

#### PRICING & AVAILABILITY

All Moon products listed on this site are available to purchase in GBP sterling or Euros. Prices include VAT where applicable. Orders to individuals based outside of the UK are exempt from UK VAT. However any import duties or local taxes charged by the destination country are payable upfront by the customer, on request, in order to clear customs. Should a customer fail to pay these charges, and refuse delivery of their order, any return shipping costs incurred will be charged to the customer along with any import/export charges incurred. Whilst we make every effort to ensure the information on our website is accurate and up to date errors may occur. Prices and availability of goods may be subject to change without prior notice. You will however be given the current price at the time you place your order. We will endeavour not to offer goods that are out of stock, although this is not always possible. If your item is unavailable we will contact you and inform you of the waiting time or cancel you order if you prefer. If you purchase a product which is incorrectly priced you will be informed of the correct price immediately and offered a chance to continue the purchase at the revised price, or cancel the order. Special offers are only available whilst stocks last and for the period displayed. Special offers can either be continued or discontinued at the sole discretion of MoonClimbing.com.

#### CANCELLATION POLICY

You have the right to cancel your order within 14 days from the day of receipt. You must provide us with a written notice (this can be an email). If your payment has been processed it will be refunded to the card used for the purchase (less delivery charges and any duty and tax charges incurred where appropriate). Unless goods are defective, it is your responsibility to return the items at your cost. Any postage cost incurred by returning the goods in this situation is non refundable. Goods must be returned in the original packaging with labels still attached.

#### PRODUCT COLOUR

MoonClimbing.com endeavours to clearly show the product details and colours of our products. However we cannot guarantee that colours will be as displayed on your screen.
