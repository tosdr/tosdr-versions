Terms And Conditions
====================

Paradigm Sample, LLC. ("PS") is a US market research company and the owner of [www.tellwut.com](https://www.tellwut.com/), a social networking site (the "Site"), which allows users to post surveys, answer surveys, refer friends to the Site to similarly post and answer online surveys, and provide certain personal information about themselves all while earning rewards that can be redeemed for merchandise. It also allows businesses to participate in a variety of fee-based programs regarding the posting of surveys and the collection of survey data.

These terms and conditions along with PS's [Privacy Policy](https://www.tellwut.com/privacy_policy) contain important details about registration and participation in the Site and the TW Rewards Program ("Program" and "Terms"). Please read them carefully as they are a binding agreement between you ("Member", "you" or "your") and us. These Terms were last modified on:Â March 16, 2022.

Any modifications to the Program or the Terms will be posted on the website located at www.tellwut.com, so you should check the "last modified" date of the Terms periodically. The online version of the Terms is the governing version. The Program is available in Canada and the United States. We reserve the right, in our sole and absolute discretion, at any time, for any reason whatsoever, and without notice, to terminate, suspend or modify the Program or the Terms at any time and without prior individual notice, which includes, without limitation, expanding the Site and the Program to other countries.

2. **Registered User**. Users can register as "**Members**", whereupon they will automatically be enrolled in the Program, which gives users the ability to earn rewards through collection of "TW Points", as defined below, when they provide more personal information about themselves beyond basic registration information, and each time they complete a survey or create a survey that is posted on the Site or refer a friend to the Site.
