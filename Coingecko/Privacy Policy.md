    2. As part of the Anonymised Data that we collect, when you access our Website via your mobile device or tablet, we will also collect information regarding the type of mobile device or tablet that you are utilising so that our Website, App and/or Site Services can provide you with the version of our Website and/or App best suited for access on your mobile device or tablet.
    3. If you do not consent to our collection of Anonymised Data, please adjust the settings on your computer, tablet and mobile device to block or disable our use of the Acceptable Technologies. In the event that you choose to access our Website or our Site Services without blocking or disabling or opting out of the Acceptable Technologies, such access by you will constitute your consent to our use of the Acceptable Technologies and our collection of information thereto.
    4. To better assist you in understanding the generally Accepted Technologies used in our collection of Anonymised Data include:-
        1. “IP Address” refers to a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you access the Internet. Under certain circumstances, your IP Address remains the same from browser session to browser session. However, in the event that a consumer Internet access provider is utilised, your IP Address will likely vary from session to session. We track IP Addresses solely in conjunction with session cookies to analyse the flow of webpages on our Website.
        2. “Cookies” refer to small pieces of data that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive or mobile device’s internal storage while you are viewing the said website. Our Website utilises both session cookies (they expire the moment your Internet browser is closed) and persistent cookies (they will remain in your computer until you actively take steps to delete them) so as to provide you with a more personalised and interactive experience on our Website. By changing the options on your Internet browser and adjusting the settings in your mobile device (subject to your version of operation system and your device’s features), you can control whether to accept or decline cookies.
        3. “Clear GIFs” refer to clear electronic images that are used to track your opening of webpages on our Website and your pattern of browsing our webpages as well as your access of our Website, for the purpose of allowing us to assess the attractiveness of the content on our Website, and the flow of webpages and layouts that appeal to you. Clear GIFs are also commonly known as “web beacons” and may be included on our Website, and generally works in conjunction with cookies to identify users and user behaviour. Some of our HTML based emails also utilise Clear GIFs in order for us to assess what are the emails we sent that have been opened and acted upon. Clear GIFs collect only limited data, such as a cookie number, the time and date of when a particular webpage, feature or service on our Website is accessed, and a description of the webpage, feature or service on our Website in which the clear GIF resides. Such collected Anonymised Data helps us to determine the effectiveness of the way our webpages, features and services are arranged on our Website, our modes of communications and promotional campaigns.
        4. “Third-party web analytics” refer to services provided by third party service providers for the assessment, analysis, measurement and reporting of the behaviour of visitors to a website in order to assess and improve the effectiveness of the website. One of the most well-known third-party analytics service is “Google Analytics”.
        5. “HTML5 local storage” refer to caching services utilizing primarily a cache manifest file, which allows for storage of your preferences offline which will then be updated and synchronized when you go online.
        6. “Dynamic device identifiers” refer to “identifier for advertisers” or “IFA”, which is a random, anonymous number assigned to an end-user of the iPhone or iPad and is temporary, allowing it to be blocked like a cookie. When an end-user views an application or browses the internet, the end-user’s presence generates a call for an advertisement as the publisher’s site that the end-user is viewing will pass the IFA to the ad server and the advertiser is then able to serve the end-user with an advertisement relevant to the topic being viewed. IFA can also be used to identify whether the advertisements resulted in end-users downloading applications or purchasing products that were advertised. The IFA does not identify the end-user personally, it provides an aggregated audience data that advertisers can target with advertisements. IFA can be opted out of via the settings in the end-user’s device (by default, the IFA is enabled), subject to the availability of such options in the version of your operating system and the features of your device.
    5. In the event that you decide in your sole discretion and risk to use any of the token swap functions made available via hyperlinks on our Site, your ETH Address will be exposed. If you do not accept the potential risk, please do not use any swap functions or perform any token swaps on our Site.

    1. Our Website, our Site Services (including our CoinGecko API and other APIs), our App, our Content, our Updates, our events, our promotions, our services and products are not meant for persons who may be defined as minors under applicable law. As such, if you are below 21, please terminate all access to our Website, our App and Site Services immediately, and do not register any account with us. We reserve the right (but not the obligation) to demand at any time evidence for our review to verify that you are above 21 years of age.

    2. To clarify, we do not knowingly collect Personal Data from minors, however, through the internet, we are not able to ascertain on our end whether such individuals are minors. It is thus the responsibility of parents or guardians to ensure that their minors do not access our Website, use our Site Services (including our CoinGecko API), download our App, enrol for any of our events, download or access our related applications, email us, or provide us with Personal Data without their parental/guardian’s consent. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her minor has accessed our Website, our App or our Site Services or provided us with Personal Data without his/her consent, he or she should contact our Data Protection Officer at [hello@coingecko.com](mailto:hello@coingecko.com) promptly.
11. Security Measures for Protection of Personal Data
    1. We ensure that our Website is protected by reasonable security measures afforded by current technology, and that all our data hosts and servers are similarly protected by such security measures, including but not limited to firewalls.
    2. Your Personal Data is kept securely and protected against unauthorized access and disclosure. We utilise security means such as (without limitation) password protection, encryption, locked and restricted access. We have strict policies in place restricting access to Personal Data to only our authorized personnel on a need-to-know basis.
    3. We will take practical steps to ensure that your Personal Data will not be kept longer than as set out herein this Privacy Policy, or for as long as is necessary for fulfilling the purposes for which you have entrusted us with your Personal Data, or as may be required for legitimate business or legal purposes, whichever is the latest.
12. Third Party Sites, and Social Network Sites
    1. Our Website, our App, our APIs, our Site Services (including but not limited to widgets and plugins), our Updates, our Content, our loyalty program’s redemption items and system, emails and other promotional messages may contain hyperlinks to websites operated by third parties. Some of the aforesaid third party links may also be “affiliate links”. However, such third party websites are not governed by our Privacy Policy or Website Terms of Use. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or data security of such third party websites, even if they are affiliate links, co-branded with our Company name or logo, or our Website or Site Services, or promotional messages on our Site display products or services that originate from such third parties, or our Site displays products or services originating from such third parties as redemption rewards available thereunder our loyalty points redemption scheme, or when we allow your utilization of social login to register an account with us, to access your account, our Website, App, APIs, other services or products. As such, we urge you to learn about the privacy policies of these third party websites before accessing or using them, and to be careful about providing any Personal Data to such third party websites. We seek your understanding that we are not liable for any acts or omissions or any loss or damage that you may suffer due to your use or access of such third party websites.
    2. For clarification, “affiliate links” refer to third party links on our Site pursuant to which our Company may receive compensation from the referenced third party, which may be in the form of tokens, digital currency, fiat currency, services or products from such affiliated third parties (which includes without limitation “Binance”, and certain operators of Social Media Sites). Such compensation to our Company may be provided to our Company even if you do not click on the affiliate links, and/or additional compensation may be provided to our Company if you do click on such affiliate links and/or take any further action in relation to such affiliate links (for example, signing up on the affiliate’s website or using the affiliate’s application). In the event that you take any action such as clicking on an “affiliate link”, and particularly if you take any further steps thereafter such as (without limitation) subscribing for the affiliated third party’s services, please be aware that your information (including without limitation your Personal Data), may be collected by such affiliated third party. Please therefore read the privacy policy of such affiliated third parties carefully before you agree to disclose any of your Personal Data to any such affiliated third parties, and you do so at your own risk and discretion. Each affiliate link is identified by an affiliate icon next to it.
    3. Without limiting the generality of Clauses 12.1 and 12.2 above, as our Website incorporates videos and podcasts regarding cryptocurrency, utility tokens, digital coins/currency, ICOs that do not amount to an offering of securities or securities-tokens, and other related digital currency information, and such videos and podcasts (or links to such videos and podcasts) are made available via YouTube, or the use of YouTube API Services (as defined in the “YouTube Terms of Service” found at https://www.youtube.com/t/terms), you hereby agree that in order for you to access the aforesaid videos and podcasts, you must agree to abide by all provisions therein the YouTube Terms of Service as well as the Google Privacy Policy at http://www.google.com/policies/privacy, failing which, you are not permitted to access the aforesaid videos and podcasts.
    4. Our Company may utilise reputable social media/network sites such as, but not limited to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest and LinkedIn as well as app stores such as Google and Apple platforms (collectively the “Social Media Sites”) so as to connect to your social networks, or to allow for your utilization of social login to register an account with us, to access your account, our Website, App, APIs, other services or products. In order to allow for your utilization of social login to register an account with us, to access your account, our Website, App, APIs, other services or products, and/or to generate interest in our Website, our App, our APIs and our Site Services, our products and services amongst the contacts in your social networks and to allow you to share your interest in our Website, our App, our APIs, our Site Services, our Updates, our Content, our events, and/or our other products and services, we may provide access to our Website to the third party Social Media Sites, and there may thus be links on our Website to such Social Media Sites. The aforesaid association with the Social Media Sites does not constitute any endorsement or recommendation of any of the Social Media Sites by our Company nor vice versa. As per clauses 12.1 and 12.2 above, kindly review the terms of use and privacy policies of the Social Media Sites before you use or access such Social Media Sites in conjunction with our Website, our App or Site Services or any of our promotions and our products or services made available via any Social Media Sites.
    5. The association of our Website, our App, APIs, and/or Site Services with the Social Media Sites makes available certain features which when used by you, may result in information being made available from your accounts with the Social Media Sites to our Company, which in the case of your utilization of social login to register an account with us, to access your account, our Website, App, APIs, other services or products tends to be limited to the collection, retention and use of your email address.

If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy or your Personal Data, please contact our Data Protection Officer at [https://support.coingecko.com/hc/en-us/requests/new](https://support.coingecko.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) or [hello@coingecko.com](mailto:hello@coingecko.com).
14. Citizens of and Residents in Members of the European Union
    1. This Section 14 of the Privacy Policy is applicable only if you are a citizen of, or resident in, any members of the European Union. The clauses hereunder this Section 14 supplements the above provisions of this Privacy Policy which will still apply to you.
    2. Our collection, use, processing and retention of Personal Data is as described above. Our legal basis for processing of Personal Data is dependent on the context in which the Personal Data was collected, which will therefore also determine the type of Personal Data collected. Nonetheless, collection and processing of Personal Data is usually only performed where it is necessary for us to provide our services or products to you, and for us to comply with applicable legal requirements (as further described in Sections 3, 4 and 5 above), where necessary for our legitimate business or legal interests that are not superseded by your rights, and/or where you have consented.
    3. In the event that your Personal Data has been collected based on our (or a relevant third party’s) legitimate interests, the said legitimate interest is generally for the operation of our Company and the provision of our services, managing our relationship with you such as updating your Activity Post listing, account status, communicating with you in order to provide you with our services and products (whether developed by our Company or third parties as made available via our Site), updates to our Website, App, APIs, Content, Site Services, Activity Post listings, activities, events, offers, and other legitimate business interest such as replying to your requests, sending you Updates, maintaining your Activity Post, communicating with you on your Activity Post, facilitating your participation in our loyalty rewards program, allowing for your redemption of loyalty points, developing our Website, our App, our APIs, our Site Services, our other products and our services, offering promotions, publicity, or security enhancements, crime prevention and fraud detection. Should we have other legitimate interests, we will where appropriate notify you of them clearly at the relevant time.
    4. In the event that you are requested to provide your Personal Data in order to enter into a contract with us, or for compliance with a legal obligation, we will make it clear to you at the appropriate juncture and advise you accordingly as to whether the provision of your Personal Data is indispensable, together with the possible consequences that may ensue should you still choose not to provide your Personal Data under the circumstances. To illustrate, in the event that you request for us to send you regular updates on the latest news regarding cryptocurrency trading volume, in order for you to receive such updates and fully benefit from and utilize our services, your Personal Data would have to be provided to us and processed as per the above provisions of this Privacy Policy.
    5. Your Personal Data will be retained and processed securely for as long as there is still ongoing legitimate commercial need for such retention and processing. Examples of legitimate commercial needs would be to allow you to continue accessing our Website, to maintain your Activity Post listing on our Website, to maintain your account, subscription or membership, facilitating your redemption of loyalty points, providing Updates and other services to you, investigating and defending any potential legal action or claim against us, and as may be required or permitted by applicable laws (including laws pertaining to taxation and keeping of accounting records). As soon as there is no more legitimate business or legal needs for us to retain and process your Personal Data, your Personal Data will be deleted or anonymised (where possible), and in the event that it is not possible (such as storage of Personal Data in backup archives), we will ensure the security of your Personal Data that is being stored, segregate it so that no further processing will be carried out using your Personal Data, and will delete your Personal Data once possible.
    6. As we are a business based in Singapore, your Personal Data will be transferred to countries that are not members of the European Union, including countries such as Singapore which may not mandate the same obligations of data protection as the European Union. Nonetheless, please be assured that we adopt appropriate measures to ensure that recipients (as described in Section 4 above) of your Personal Data are bound to obligations of protection, security and confidentiality similar to the obligations hereunder this Privacy Policy, including but not limited to the use of contractual clauses in our contracts/terms and conditions with such recipients.
    7. As a citizen of, or resident in, any members of the European Union, you can exercise your following data protection rights at any time by contacting us via the details provided in Clause 14.8:-
        * You have the right to request access to, correction of, updating or deleting of your Personal Data held with us;
        * You have the right to object to processing of your Personal Data based on our legitimate interests, and also the separate right to object to direct marketing activities and communications from us;

        * You are entitled to withdraw your consent to our collection and processing of your Personal Data at any time. However, there may be consequences (such as your inability to receive Updates that you may have requested or paid for) arising from such withdrawal which we will inform you at the appropriate juncture.

        * You may at any time submit a complain to a data protection regulatory authority about our collection and use of your Personal Data. Please check with your local data protection regulatory authority for more details in submitting such complaints.
        * We will respond to all requests we receive pertaining to the exercise of an individual’s data protection rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws.In the event that you become aware of changes or inaccuracies in your Personal Data, please notify us promptly for the updating and correction of our records.
