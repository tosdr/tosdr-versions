    3.

    4. Any credit checks, ratings, litigation history, key personnel reports, or other information that may be provided in our Content in relation to any Fundraisers (where such information is not provided by the Fundraiser itself) are based on third party websites, service providers and bureaus, and we are therefore unable to warrant or undertake any liability on the reliability, validity and accuracy of such third party reports.
    5. IN NO CIRCUMSTANCES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED AT LAW, SHALL OUR COMPANY NOR ANY OF ITS SHAREHOLDERS, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, AGENTS, REPRESENTATIVES OR EMPLOYEES BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, LOSS, LOSS OF CUSTOMERS, LOST PROFITS, LOST INTEREST PAYMENTS, LOST PRINCIPALS, LOST BUSINESS, LOST OPPORTUNITIES, LOSS OF INVESTMENTS, LOST DATA, COST OF SERVICING OR REPAIR OF TABLET, SMART PHONES, MOBILE PHONES, COMPUTER OR OTHER EQUIPMENT, SPECIAL DAMAGES, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL LOSS OR DAMAGES, HOWSOEVER ARISING OR SUFFERED AS A RESULT OF ANY USE (OR INABILITY TO USE) OF OUR SITE OR OUR UPDATES OR CONTENT OR SITE SERVICES OR OUR SERVICES OR OUR PRODUCTS, OR OUR COMPANY’S BREACH OF ANY PROVISION HEREIN THIS WEBSITE TERMS OF USE OR OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE AGREEMENT, OR MISREPRESENTATION OR NEGLIGENCE OR FRAUD BY ANY FUNDRAISERS, WHETHER DUE TO VIRUSES OR THIRD PARTY HACKERS OR EMBEDDED MALWARE, OR ANY RELIANCE ON OR USE OF THE INFORMATION, CONTENT, THIRD PARTY LINKS, THE SERVICES OR PRODUCTS INTRODUCED OR DESCRIBED HEREIN OUR SITE, OUR SITE SERVICES, OR OUR UPDATES EVEN IF OUR COMPANY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF SUCH USE OR RELIANCE IN ADVANCE.
    6. Our Company further disclaims any and all liability for any losses or damages that you may incur as a direct result of accessing or howsoever using (including but not limited to storing of information on) our Site, our Site Services, our Content or our Updates, including but not limited to any virus, trojan horse, malware or worm attacks on your tablet, smart phone, or computer.
    7. For the avoidance of doubt, at all times, our Company acts primarily as an information service provider with ancillary services such as decentralized token swaps, and never as a sales representative, trading broker, intermediary, agent, principal, financial advisor, exchange, brokerage, clearing house or trading platform of any kind or capacity for which a licence from the Monetary Authority of Singapore may be required. Without limiting the generality of the aforegoing, the availability of coin purchase and token swapping functionalities on our Website does not render our Site a trading platform for securities as only selected cryptocurrency and tokens (which do not constitute securities as defined in the Securities and Futures Act) can be swapped in a decentralized manner. Accordingly, no information in our Content is to be regarded as an offer, solicitation, or an invitation to treat by our Company. Nothing in our Content constitutes any advice or recommendation to subscribe to any particular ICO or Fundraiser, trade in any digital coins, purchase any tokens or perform any token swaps. Should you wish to subscribe to any particular ICO, please contact the relevant Fundraiser directly. Similarly, should you wish to trade in any specific coins, please contact your broker or trade via the relevant coin exchange platforms accordingly. If you wish to conduct a decentralized token swap using any of our third party provided/hyperlinked token swap functionalities, please conduct your own checks (including the third party’s terms and conditions) to satisfy yourself that your intended swap should be performed before so doing. Accordingly, you agree that our Company bears no liability whatsoever to you in relation to any subscription, product (including coin) purchase, trade or swap that you carry out at your sole risk and discretion.
    8. You are strongly encouraged to conduct your own due diligence checks and procure your own professional advice before subscribing, trading, purchasing, using our CoinGecko API, swapping any tokens, or entering into any transactions due to use of or access to our Site. You should only enter into any transaction after due and careful consideration, understanding the risks, and having considered whether you are able to bear such risks of losses. It is therefore in your total and sole discretion as to whether to use any of our Site Services, swap, trade, purchase and/or subscribe to any ICOs listed on our Site. You are at no time under any duress from our Company, Fundraisers and/or any other users of our Site to trade, swap, purchase, subscribe and/or enter into any transactions. Therefore, you agree that you voluntarily assume all risks and full liability in all your transactions, and undertake that you shall not howsoever hold the Company liable or responsible whatsoever in the event of any damages or losses suffered, including but not limited to losses that you may suffer due to misrepresentation, negligent information or fraudulent acts of any Fundraisers.
    9. In the event that our Company’s liability to you in relation to our Site, our Site Services, our Content, our Updates, products and/or services featured on our Site and/or Updates, cannot be fully disclaimed, you agree that our Company’s total liability to you shall not exceed S$50, which you agree is a reasonable compensation amount taking into consideration the limited nature of our Company’s services. Accordingly, you agree that upon receipt of S$50 from the Company, you will waive all rights against the Company and will make no further claims whatsoever against the Company.
9. Non-Interference
    1. You undertake that you shall not howsoever mine data from, scrape, interfere or attempt to interfere with any part of our Site or Site Services, disrupt accessibility to our Site (or any part thereof), or bypass any security measures that we may include with our Site and/or Site Services, including but not limited to the utilization of any screen-scraper, hacks, spider, robot, virus, worms or other means to access or attack our Site or Site Services for any purpose without our prior written consent.
10. Indemnification
    1. You agree to fully indemnify, defend and hold our Company and its shareholders, directors, officers, employees, representatives, agents, subcontractors, and licensors harmless from and against any and all claims (including but not limited to third party claims for intellectual property infringement due to your breach of Section 4 and/or Clause 9.1 herein), damages, costs and expenses, including but not limited legal fees and settlement payments on a full indemnity (solicitor-client) basis arising from or related to your breach of any of the provisions herein this Website Terms of Use, our Privacy Policy, API Terms of Service, Listing T&Cs, any other service provisions of the Agreement, your use of our Site, our Site Services, our Content and/or Updates.
    2. For the avoidance of doubt, regardless of the indemnification received by the Company from you, the Company shall have full authority and charge over its own defence, legal actions, and settlement proceedings in relation to any third party claims without any reference to you.
11. Governing Law and Jurisdiction
    1. Our Website Terms of Use and accordingly your agreement thereto shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Singapore, without reference to any conflict-of-law principles.
    2. In the event of any disputes arising from this Website Terms of Use or any of the other provisions of the Agreement, your use of our Site, our Site Services and/or Content, you must first contact our Company’s officer at [hello@coingecko.com](mailto:hello@coingecko.com) regarding your dispute, and use your best endeavours to amicably settle any dispute in good faith. We on our part will also use our best endeavours to amicably settle your concerns in good faith. However, if no amicable resolution is reached within 30 days, both parties agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of Singapore.
12. Miscellaneous
    1. If any provision or clause of our Website Terms of Use, any of our other terms and conditions constituting the Agreement, or part thereof respectively, is rendered void, illegal or unenforceable by any legislation or laws to which it is subject, it shall be modified so as to give effect to its intention, or where such modification is not possible, that provision or clause shall be rendered void, illegal or unenforceable to that extent only and it shall in no way affect or prejudice the enforceability of the remainder of such provision or clause or the other provisions of our Website Terms of Use and our other terms and conditions of the Agreement.
    2. The failure or delay of our Company at any time to enforce any of its rights hereunder our Website Terms of Use and other terms and conditions of the Agreement shall not be constituted as a waiver thereof and shall in no manner affect our Company’s rights at a later time to enforce the same.
    3. You agree that you shall not hold our Company for any delay or failure in performance (including but not limited to non-accessibility to our Site and/or Site Services) due to events beyond our Company’s reasonable control, including but not limited to natural catastrophes, civil riots, acts of war, shortage of utilities, and any applicable laws and regulations.
    4. A person who is not a party to this Agreement shall have no right under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act (Cap. 53B) to enforce any of its terms.
