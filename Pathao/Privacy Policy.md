Privacy Policy
--------------

Last updated: October 1, 2019

This privacy policy describes how the Pathao.com website and related application (the “Site”, “we” or “us”) collects, uses, shares and protects the personal information that we collect through this Site. Pathao has established this Site to link up users who need something shipped or delivered (“Customers”) with individuals who will provide the shipping and delivery services (“Couriers”) or teams of affiliated Couriers (“Teams”). This policy also applies to any mobile applications that we develop for use with our services and Team specific pages on the Site, and references to this “Site”, “we” or “us” is intended to also include these mobile applications. Please read below to learn more about our information practices. By using this Site, you agree to these practices.

How We Collect Information
--------------------------

### Information Provided By Your Web Browser

You have to provide us with personal information like your name, contact no, mailing address and email id, our app will also fetch your location information in order to give you the best service. Like many other websites, we may record information that your web browser routinely shares, such as your browser type, browser language, software and hardware attributes, the date and time of your visit, the web page from which you came, your Internet Protocol address and the geographic location associated with that address, the pages on this Site that you visit and the time you spent on those pages. This will generally be anonymous data that we collect on an aggregate basis. We may also use Google Analytics or a similar service to gather statistical information about the visitors to this Site and how they use the Site. This, also, is done on an anonymous basis. We will not try to associate anonymous data with your personally identifiable data. If you would like to learn more about Google Analytics, please click here.

### Personal Information That You Provide

If you want to use our service or contact a Pathao member, you must create an account on our Site. To establish your account, we will ask for personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you, which may include your name, phone number, and e-mail address. We may also collect demographic information about you, such as your zip code, and allow you to submit additional information that will be part of your Pathao profile.

Other than basic information that we need to establish your account, it will be up to you to decide how much information to share as part of your profile. We encourage you to think carefully about the information that you share and we recommend that you guard your identity and your sensitive information. Of course, you can review and revise your profile at any time.

From time to time, we may run contests or promotions and ask for a postal mailing address and other personal information relating to the contest or promotion. It will always be your choice whether to provide your personal information in order to participate in these events.

### Payment Information

Our only payment channel is cash on delivery. Thus, if you are a Customer, you will make payments once the courier is at your door step. We will have your adress and cotact no. in order to identify the customer.

### Information About Others

If you are a Customer planning to ship something using the Pathao service, we will ask you for information about the sender location and contact and recipient location and contact of the shipment.

Use Of Cookies And Similar Technology
-------------------------------------

### Session And Persistent Cookies

As is commonly done on websites, we may use cookies and similar technology to keep track of our users and the services they have elected. A “cookie” is a small text file containing alphanumeric characters that is stored on your computer’s hard drive and uniquely identifies your browser. We use both “session” and “persistent” cookies. Session cookies are deleted after you leave our website and when you close your browser. We use data collected with session cookies to enable certain features on our Site, to help us understand how users interact with our Site, and to monitor at an aggregate level Site usage and web traffic routing.

If you have created an account, we will also use persistent cookies that remain on your computer’s hard-drive between visits, so that when you return to our Site we can remember who you are and your preferences. For example, after you log out of our Site, these persistent cookies can enable you to return to our Site without the need to log back in.

We may allow business partners who provide services to our Site to place cookies on your computer that assist us in analyzing usage data. We do not allow these business partners to collect your personal information from our website except as may be necessary for the services that they provide.

You can manage these cookies. For example, you can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. If you disable cookies, however, it may interfere with the functionality of our Site and you may not be able to use all of the Site’s features.

### Web Beacons

We may also use web beacons or similar technology to help us track the effectiveness of our communications. For example, if you have elected to receive any of our e-mail newsletters, we may use technology that allows us to see how many recipients have opened the message and how many have clicked on one of its links.

### Advertising Cookies

We may use third parties, such as Google, to serve ads about our website over the internet. These third parties may use cookies to identify ads that may be relevant to your interest (for example, based on your recent visit to our website), to limit the number of times that you see an ad, and to measure the effectiveness of the ads. You can disable these advertising cookies by opting out at [http://www.google.com/privacy\_ads.html.](https://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html)

### What We Do With The Information We Collect

We will generally use the information that we collect to provide our services, to monitor and analyze visitor activity on our website, promote and support our services, and develop a knowledge base regarding our website users. As detailed below, certain information that you provide may be available to visitors to the Site, and some information will be shared between Customers and Teams and/or Couriers.

### Registered Pathao Users

When you register on our Site or App, you will create a user name and profile. Your user name and profile will be accessible by the users of our Site.

If you agree, we may also use your e-mail address to send you a newsletter or other information about our services or about other products or services in which you may be interested.

### Shipment Recipients And Referrals

We may provide an e-mail/ text messaging service for alerting recipients that a shipment is on it’s way through the Pathao service. If you elect to provide us with an e-mail address or contact no. of the person or organization receiving your shipment, we will send the recipient a notification message of the shipment and the expected delivery time frame. We may also use the recipient’s contact information from time to time to send the recipient a promotional message about our services, and will always give the recipient the option to decline any future promotional messages.

We may also provide you with the opportunity to refer a potential customer to our Pathao services and earn a commission on the referral. To take advantage of this opportunity, you will need to provide Pathao with the e-mail address of the potential customer. We will include your name in the promotional message that we send the potential customer, but will always give the potential customer the option to decline any future promotional messages.

Of course, we will not share recipient or potential customer contact information with other third parties for their marketing purposes. We may, however, share the recipient or potential customer contact information with Teams or Super Teams for purpose of performing the delivery services.

### Information Shared With Our Business Partners

We may use business partners to help us design and operate our Site and provide services to support the Site. We may also hire a company to run certain website applications, provide data storage and processing services, or help us analyze our data. These business partners may have access to the personal information that we keep, but only so that they may perform these tasks on our behalf. We do not allow these business partners to make any independent commercial use of the individually identifiable information that we store, to share such data with third parties or from making the data publicly available. Keep in mind, however, that if you establish a separate relationship with one of these business partners, the information you provide directly to that organization will be subject to its terms of use and its privacy practices.

We may also provide your personal information to our business partners or other trusted entities for the purpose of providing you with information on goods or services we believe will be of interest to you. You can, at any time, opt out of receiving such communications. Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on a user’s prior visits to Pathao. You can disable these specific cookies that track prior visits for the sake of follow-up advertising by opting out at [http://www.google.com/privacy\_ads.html](https://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html).

### Information Shared With Super Teams

Teams for different geographic areas may be organized under a larger entity (a “Super Team”). Any information that you share with the Site may also be shared with a Super Team and may be used by the Super Team in any manner consistent with this Privacy Policy as if the Super Team were us.
