============

Last Revised: 5/31/2024

1\. Acceptance of Terms Through Use
-----------------------------------

Your use of the Website is subject to these Terms of Use. The Terms of Use constitute a legally binding agreement between us. All personal information collected through this Website is subject to our [Privacy Policy](https://www.lendkey.com/privacy-policy/) that is incorporated herein by reference. **Please review the Terms of Use in their entirety before using our Website. By using our Website, you acknowledge and agree that you understand and accept all terms and conditions described herein, and you agree to be bound by such terms and conditions.**  You should print and retain a copy of all of the legal agreements on this Website for your records. If you do not agree to abide by the Terms of Use, you must not use this Website.

2\. About Our Services
----------------------

**Not a Lender.** We are not a lender, nor do we hold any interest in any loans originated via our Website. We do not make loans or make credit decisions in connection with your loans. You may contact us using the information in the Notice and Contacting Us section below.

**Loans.** LendKey Technologies provides you with the ability to apply for loans with Lenders who partner with us for loan origination and servicing services. If you are not already a customer or member of a partnering Lender, we may match the information you provide us with the eligibility criteria of Lenders who offer loans that may be of interest to you.  If you are eligible to apply for loans offered by Lenders, then we may display choices that may interest you, and you can determine if you would like to complete a loan application with any such Lender on our Website. We collect information from you to register you as a user of our Website.  If you do not meet the eligibility criteria for the Lenders, then we may not provide you with any choices. You will have to complete an application with a Lender and provide any additional required information before they will offer you a loan. Lenders offer these terms directly to you. We may provide your information to Lenders at your request and with your authorization to allow the Lender to review your application and determine if you qualify for a Loan. When you have selected a loan option and completed a full application is the point that you start the actual application process for a loan from the Lender that you have selected. The application and supporting information that you submit to us in connection with the application is reviewed by the Lender and it is the Lender’s sole determination as to whether to approve your loan application.  If your loan is approved and disbursed, we may also service your loan.  As the loan servicer, we may send you periodic invoices, collect payments, apply payments to your account, and provide you with access to view your loan account on our online MyAccount portal.

**Relationship with Lenders.** You must rely on your own judgment to decide which product and Lender suits your needs. You are under no obligation to use our Website to find a loan. We do not guarantee that providing your information and completing a request will result in you meeting a Lender’s eligibility criteria. You may not receive an offer or approval from a Lender. We do not have any control over the criteria that Lenders use in accepting or rejecting your application. We do not guarantee that the options available to you from the Lenders are the best terms or the lowest rates available. .

**No Endorsement.** We do not recommend or endorse the products or offerings of any Lender. The Lender is solely responsible for its services and relationship with you. We are not liable for any damages or costs related to your relationship with the Lender.  Additionally, we are not affiliated with, nor do we endorse, any educational institution.   

**Not an Agent.** Unless stated otherwise, we are not your agent.

**Collection of Information and Verification.** We may require that you furnish us and the Lender with identifying information. We use this information as detailed under our [Privacy Policy](https://www.lendkey.com/privacy-policy/). We also use this information to match you with potential loan offers from Lenders. **You authorize us and Lenders to obtain a personal credit profile from a credit bureau for credit pre-qualification and identity verification. You further agree that we may verify your identity and the information you provide us with third parties.**

A Lender may require more information from you to apply for a loan. The terms and conditions of any loan available from the Lender may change depending on information available to the Lender or your complete credit profile. We, or a Lender, may require further information from you to comply with our legal obligations, including, without limitation, anti-terrorism laws and regulations.

You agree that any information you provide us will be governed by the Terms of Use, including, without limitation, the Conditions of Use section below.

**Sharing of Information.** You agree that we may share your information with Lenders who you apply for a loan with through our Website. You acknowledge that Lenders have their own privacy practices and that you should review and understand their privacy policies and website terms of use when you apply for a loan with these Lenders. You agree that both the Lender and we may communicate with you regarding your use of the Website, the Service, and the information you shared with us.

**Fees.** We do not charge you fees for the use of our Services. Lenders compensate us for services that we provide to them. This compensation varies with each Lender, loan, or service. Your loan, loan rate, or loan terms may include an origination fee paid by the Lender.
