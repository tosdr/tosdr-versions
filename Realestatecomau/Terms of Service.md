**Third Party Content**

Our platform contains content provided to REA by other parties (**Third Party Content**). REA does not have a practice of monitoring or making inquiries about Third Party Content. REA is not responsible for, does not endorse and makes no representations either expressly or impliedly concerning Third Party Content. Third Party Content does not represent the views of REA. You rely on Third Party Content completely at your own risk. 

**Platform providers**

Our apps and voice assistant products are provided subject to the platform or software provider’s terms.

**(a) Apple**

If you download one of our apps through the iOS App Store, you acknowledge that these terms incorporate an end user licence agreement between you and REA.  The end user licence agreement is between us and you – it is not an agreement between Apple Inc. (**Apple**) and you. 

We grant you a non-transferable licence to use the app on any iPhone or iPad that you own or control.  You must comply with the Usage Rules in the [App Store Terms](http://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/appstore/jm/terms.html).

You acknowledge that:

* REA (not Apple) is solely responsible for the app and its contents; and
* Apple is not required to provide maintenance or support services for the app.

If the app fails to comply with a warranty (if any), you may notify Apple and Apple will refund the app purchase price to you.  To the maximum extent permitted by law, Apple has no other warranty obligation with respect to the app.  Any other claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs or expenses attributable to a warranty failure (if any) is our responsibility.

We are (and Apple is not) responsible for:

* addressing any claims by you or any third party relating to the app or your possession or use of the app, including (but not limited to): (i) product liability claims; (ii) failure of the app to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims under consumer protection or similar legislation; and
* investigating, defending, settling and discharging any third party claim that the app or your possession or use of the app infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights.

You represent and warrant that: (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.

 If you have any questions, complaints or claims you can contact us at [customercare@realestate.com.au](mailto:customercare@realestate.com.au), via the ‘feedback’ option on the app Settings menu or by calling 1300 134 174.

You acknowledge and agree that Apple and its subsidiaries are third party beneficiaries of this end user licence agreement and that, your acceptance of these terms (and this end user licence agreement), gives Apple (and you accept that Apple has) the right to enforce the end user licence agreement against you as a third party beneficiary of the agreement.

**(b)** **Android**

Apps accessible via Android devices include software from The Android Open Source Project Copyright (c) 2005-2008, The Android Open Source Project. Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the “License”); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.  Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software distributed under the License is distributed on an “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied. See the License for the specific language governing permissions and limitations under the License.

**(c)** **Amazon**

If you download one of our skills through the Amazon Skills store, you acknowledge that these terms incorporate an end user licence agreement between you and REA.  The end user licence agreement is between us and you – it is not an agreement between Amazon and you.

We grant you a non-transferable licence to use the REA Alexa Skill on the terms set out in this agreement.

**(d) Google Maps**

Your use of Google Maps is subject to the [Google Maps Terms of Service](https://maps.google.com/help/terms_maps.html) and [Google Privacy Policy](https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/). 

**Property Reports**

If you request a property or suburb report or price estimate (**Property Report**) via our platform, you consent to the use of your email address for the purposes described in our [Privacy Policy](https://about.realestate.com.au/privacy/). Property Reports are of a general nature only, based on historical data and will not take into account the potential impact of external factors (such as changes in the economy, future planned infrastructure, regulation, environment  or the property market) which may affect the value of the property. Property Reports should not be regarded as advice or relied upon by you or any other person and we recommend that you seek professional advice before making any property decisions.  In providing a Property Report, we do not act as an agent for you or any real estate professional involved in preparation of the report. For the avoidance of doubt, indicated sections of Property Reports and sections provided by real estate professionals (including any price estimate) are deemed to be Third Party Content for the purposes of the section immediately above.

**Editorial content**

Any editorial content or articles on our site are of a general nature only and do not consider your personal objectives, financial situation or particular needs. Editorial content should not be regarded as advice or relied upon by you or any other person and we recommend that you seek professional advice before acting on the content. For the avoidance of doubt, editorial content provided by third party authors that are not employed by us is deemed to be Third Party Content for the purposes of the section above.
