Return Policy

If you are not fully satisfied with your purchase, you may request a full refund of the purchase price within 60 days.  
  
Part of the cancelation process is returning the original shipment. I do understand that I will have to return the unused portion of the product to receive any sort of credit or refund. I do understand that part of the cancelation process requires me to have a cancelation number. I must retain this number as proof of my cancelation. I do understand that I have a 60-day return policy. I can take advantage of this return policy at any time. This 60-day return policy starts from the original order date.  
  
Refunds usually take up to 7-10 business days to process back into your account. These processing days start from when the package is received at the return center.
