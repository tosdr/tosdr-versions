I. Introduction
---------------

The following Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) describes how BN Media, LLC (“Bibleminute,” “BN Media,” “we,” “us,” “Operator”) collects, uses, and shares personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information collected (collectively referred to as “Data”) through website, mobile website, mobile applications, and social media platforms we operate (collectively, the “Products”) and the services, features, advertisements or content we offer, including your communications with us or others through our messaging and phone services (collectively with the Products, the “Services”). The Policy applies when you use any of these Products or Services regardless of how you access or use the Services. This Policy describes the kinds of Data we may gather when you use the Products or Services, how we may use your Data, when we might disclose your Data, and how you can manage your Data.

II. Revisions
-------------

We may change the Policy at any time by posting revisions to the Policy on the Products or Services. If we make material changes to how we treat your Data, we will notify you through general notice through the Products. If you do not accept all of the terms, conditions and notices set forth in the Policy, you must not use the Products or Services. Please note that our Products and Services are under constant development. This Policy may therefore be modified and updated at any time and on an ongoing basis. Each such modification will be effective upon posting on the Products and the effective date will be noted at the beginning of such revised Privacy Policy. The date the Policy was last revised is identified at the top of the page. Your continued use of the Products or Services after Operator posts a revised Privacy Policy signifies your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy. Therefore, you should review the Privacy Policy periodically so that you are up to date on our most current policies and practices.

III. Collection of Information from Children
--------------------------------------------

The Products and Services are not directed to, or intended for use by, anyone under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, you only may use the Products and Services with permission from your parents or legal guardians. Operator does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from users under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, do not use or provide any information on any of the Operator’s Products or Services (websites, apps, etc.) or through any of its features, register on any of the Operator’s Products or Services (websites, apps, etc.), make any purchases through any of the Operator’s Products or Services (websites, apps, etc.) use any of the interactive or public comment features of the Operator’s Products or Services (websites, apps, etc.) or provide any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, email address, or any screen name or user name you may use. If a child under 18 submits information through any part of the Products or Services, and we become aware that the person submitting the information is under 18, we will delete this information. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 18, please contact us at [Do Not Sell My Data](https://privacyportal.cookiepro.com/webform/8becd7f7-c923-4cd4-814a-e08c34baf60b/f5166605-38e6-4c90-b937-5fc0da2d55a3)

IV. Information Collected
-------------------------

Type of Information Collected. When you use the Products or Services, we may collect several types of information about you and/or your use of the Products or Services. The general categories of information include Personally Identifiable Information or “PII” as well as non-personally identifiable information (“non-PII”).

PII includes, but is not limited to, the following:

    * Data that is generated as part of your transactions (purchases, listings, messages, ads, viewings) using the Products and Services;
    * Data that is generated through your communications through use of the Products and Services, including your communications with us, our third-party providers, or other users of the Services (including, but not limited all messages and data generated through the Message Center); and
    * Data about your activities and interactions with our advertising partners including data about the advertisements you were shown, how often they were shown, when and where they were shown, and whether you took any action, such as clicking on an advertisement or making a purchase.

We may receive information about you from third parties consistent with relevant law and combine it with information we receive from or about you, including, information from social media websites or information from publicly or commercially available sources. This information could include:
    * When you engage with the Products or Services and their content through such third-party sites, plug-ins or applications, we may have access to certain information from your social media profile, such as your name, photo, gender, birthday, location, videos, your list of friends, etc.
    * When you link your account to any other account on third-party web site, including but not limited to a social media web site, we may have access to data regarding your use of that web site as well as personal data such third party web sites may have collected about you.
    * Commercial information, including records of purchasing habits;
    * Engagement with our Products and Services through third-party social networking sites or social media plug-ins and applications; and
    * Information from other public sources including, but not limited to, data from credit agencies or bureaus or data from data aggregators.

Non-PII includes information about your use of the Products and Services. We may collect information about your use of the Products and Services including:

* Device information. We may collect your computer or mobile device model, IP address, operating system version, browser type, language and settings, device type and settings, and other unique device identifiers.
* Location information. We may collect your location when using the Products and services on our website and apps. We may collect and store your device's source IP address and/or latitude and longitude, which may disclose your device's approximate or precise location when you access the Products or Services. Advertisements and certain content, including from third parties, may be directed to you based on this data.
* Usage information. We may collect information about the Products or Services you use, the time, duration, and date of your use of the Services, your interaction with content offered through the Products and Services, how you contacted the Products or Services, search terms used, and browsing history.

Certain features available within the Products or Services will require you to submit PII about yourself as a condition of participation. Some of the features may be offered by us, while others may be offered by third parties. (For example, you may be required to submit PII in order to enter a contest we conduct, to order certain products and services we offer, or to receive news updates by email from a third-party news source.) When you choose to submit PII to a third party in connection with your use of the Products or Services, the third party’s privacy policy, rather than this Policy, will control the use of your PII. YOU CAN ALWAYS REFUSE TO PROVIDE PII TO US, BUT THIS MAY RESULT IN DECREASED FUNCTIONALITY OF ANY OF THE OPERATOR’S WEB SITES FOR YOU AND LIMIT YOUR ABILITY TO RECEIVE INFORMATION ABOUT PRODUCTS OR SERVICES THAT MAY BE OF PARTICULAR INTEREST TO YOU.

You also may provide information to be published or displayed (hereinafter, “posted”) on public areas of the Operator’s web sites, or transmitted to other users of the Operator’s web sites, or third parties (collectively, “User Contributions”). Your User Contributions are posted on and transmitted to others at your own risk. We cannot control the actions of other users of the Operator’s web sites with whom you may choose to share your User Contributions. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that your User Contributions will not be viewed by unauthorized persons.

V. How Information is Collected
-------------------------------

We collect information both actively and passively. For example, we will collect information about you that you voluntarily provide while using the Products and Services. In addition to information provided directly by you, we (and third parties that offer features through the Products or Services) may collect non-PII through the use of “cookies,” “web beacons,” or by other electronic means

**Information We Collect Automatically.** If you use the Products or Services, read or download information from the Products or Services, your web or mobile browser may automatically send us your internet or other network activity.

**Information You Give To Us and Information We Collect From Others.** If you use the Products or Services, or you otherwise use or purchase our Products or Services, we receive and store information you enter on the Products or Services, or that you give us in-person, via telephone, email, or otherwise. We may also collect personal information from third parties that operate (a) portions of the Products or Services on our behalf or (b) independent websites. When we obtain personal data from third parties, we will treat the acquired information like the information that we collect ourselves.

VI. Cookie Policy: How We Collect Information  
From You and From Other Third Parties
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Generally**. We may place, or allow to be placed, cookies, web beacons and similar technologies on our Products and Services to store your username for easy logon, store your preferences, keep you logged in, perform analytics, analyze traffic, personalize content, and offer advertisements that match your interest. We may use these technologies to collect information when you use our Products and Services such as your IP address, web browser, mobile network information, browsing and conversion information in order to provide you with a customized user experience. These technologies may include Google Analytics and similar providers. You can learn more about how Google uses the information collected through this service at: [www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](https://www.bibleminute.co/www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/).

* Cookies. In general, a cookie is a small amount of data sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive, where it can be used to identify your computer. Cookies can be used to measure website usage, improve navigation around website, and personalize a returning visitor’s experience on the website. In most cases, you can set your browser to turn off cookies or to notify you before you receive one so that you can decide whether to accept it or not. Because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of the features on the Site, we recommend that you leave them turned on. If you block or reject our cookies, some of the features on the Products may not work for you. You can refer to the instructions for your browser to learn more about these functions.
* Web Beacons. We, our third-party service providers, advertisers and partners also may use “web beacons” or similar technologies. Web beacons are small strings of code placed on a web page to collect data about how visitors use the Products or Services. For example, web beacons may be used to count the number of users who visit the Products or Services, or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor to the Products or Services. If you set your browser to turn off cookies, web beacons and similar technologies will detect your visits to the Products or Services, but they will not associate your activity on the Products or Services with information that otherwise would be stored in cookies.

**Advertisements (Including Direct, Targeted, Third Party).** In order to continue to bring you the Products and Services, we use advertising in our Products and Services. Some of these advertisements may contain cookies, collect information, such as your IP address and device type. We may also display targeted advertisements to you based on information you have supplied to us. For instance, if you have expressed an interest in a particular product, we may supply you with advertisements from selected marketing partners of that product. They will not, however, receive your personal information unless you volunteer it to such advertisers.

We also work with ad network partners that display ads on our Products. To improve your ad experience on the Products and elsewhere on the Internet, we may send non-personal information to our ad network partners based on your browser’s activities, such as type of pages viewed and categories of interests, so that the advertising you see on the Product or other Internet websites, apps, etc., is relevant to you.

We also may allow our affiliates and third-party advertising companies (including ad servers, ad agencies, technology vendors, or providers of sponsored content) (collectively “Third Parties”) to use cookies on our Products and Services. These Third Parties may use cookies alone or in conjunction with web beacons or other tracking technologies to collect information about you when you use the Operator’s web sites. The information they collect may be associated with your personal information or they may collect information, including personal information, about your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services.

Some of these parties may use cookies in ways that we do not. You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of cookies. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access all or certain parts of the Products and Services. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you log onto our Sites.

Please note, we do not control tracking technologies used by Third Parties on any of the Operator’s web sites or how they may be used. Third Parties have the ability to set and access their cookies on your computer. Third Parties’ use of their own cookies is subject to their own privacy policies. For more information about these specialized cookies and other technologies, and to learn more about behavioral advertising or to opt out of this type of advertising for some companies, you can visit [http://www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/) or [http://networkadvertising.org/optout\_nonppii.asp](http://networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp).

You may review the instructions and/or the privacy settings for your operating system to find out how to opt out of tailored in-application advertisements.

If you have any questions about an advertisement or other targeted content, you should contact the responsible provider directly.

**Third-Party Websites.** The Products allow advertising by Third Parties that provide links to a Third-Party website. These Third Parties may use the technology described above to send (or “serve”) directly to your browser the advertisements that appear on our Products. When this happens, Third Parties automatically receive PII, such as your IP address, as well as non-PII and other information from your computer and browser, including your cookie information. They also may use cookies, Javascript, Pixel Tags and other technologies to deliver advertisements; collect information about the effectiveness of their advertisements; collect anonymous information about your visits to the Products, such as the number of times you have viewed an ad; or customize the advertising content you see. Third Parties will not collect your name, address, or other PII, unless you affirmatively provide it to them. Third Parties have the ability to set and access their cookies on your computer.

Please note, clicking on an advertisement, links or other elements on the Products may take you to an entirely different site. Links to other sites may use our Product logos or styles as a result of a co-branding agreement. These sites may use their own cookies and may collect data and make use of that data in ways that the Products would not.

Such use by a third party may include review of PII, using such PII to contact you either before or after such a transfer or sale, use or transfer of non-PII before or after such a transfer or sale, or for other purposes.

In addition, we may share your information as described below:

* Information You Elect to Share: You may choose to share information with Third Parties by clicking on links to Third Parties from within the Products or Services. In addition, you may elect to share information, including PII, through the Product or Services by, for instance, posting comments on comment boards or listing classified advertisements. Some of your activity on the Products or Services, including content you have posted, is public by default. Some of this content may include PII.
* Third-Party Advertisers and Websites: We may share your PII and non-PII with Third Parties as described in the section above titled Third-Party Advertising and Third-Party Websites.

X. Forums
---------

The Products and Services may include forums (such as message boards, chat rooms, comment boards, and reviews) that enable users to post a comment or communicate with each other. The Operator is under no obligation to moderate or edit the forums and will not be responsible for the content or use of any material posted on any forum within the Products or Services. The Operator retains the right to delete at any time and for any reason any material posted within the Products or Services.

XI. Information Security
------------------------

**How Do We Protect Personal Data?** We take information security seriously, and we use reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect the PII we collect from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. The Operator protects data using administrative, technical, and physical safeguards. When we use third-party service providers, we ask those providers to implement similar safeguards. However, we cannot guarantee that your information is completely secure either within the Company or on the systems of third-party service providers.

But we have no control over the security of other websites on the Internet that you might visit even when a link may appear to those websites on our Products or through our Services. If you share your computer or use a computer that is accessed by the general public, remember to sign off and close your browser window when you have finished your session. This will help to ensure that others cannot access your PII.

Additionally, and as you are likely aware, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take commercially reasonable steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your PII, searches or other communications will always remain secure. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. We cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to the Operator’s web sites. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on any of the Operator’s web sites.

In the event of a breach of the confidentiality or security of your PII, we will notify you if reasonably possible and as reasonably necessary so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We may notify you under such circumstances using the e-mail address(es) we have on record for you. You should also take care with how you handle and disclose your PII. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website at [http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/](http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/) for information about how to protect against identity theft.

#### How Long Do We Keep Your Personal Data?

We retain personal data we collect from you when we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (i.e., to provide you with the Services you have requested or to comply with applicable legal requirements). When we no longer have an ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will physically destroy, delete or anonymize it or, if this is not possible, then we will securely store your personal data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

XII. General Contact Information
--------------------------------

If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy or exercising any of your privacy rights, please contact us at the telephone number, email address or mailing address listed below:

Telephone Number: 1-833-796-0136 (PIN: 141439)  
Email Address: [copyrightagent@bnmediallc.com](mailto:copyrightagent@bnmediallc.com)

XIII. Your State Privacy Rights
-------------------------------

If you are a California, Nevada or Virginia resident, your state’s laws may provide you with additional rights regarding our use of your personal information. Please see the state-specific sections below:

### Important Information for California Residents: Your California Privacy Rights

California’s “Shine the Light” law (Civil Code Section § 1798.83) permits users of our Product and Services that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please contact us at [Do Not Sell My Data](https://privacyportal.cookiepro.com/webform/8becd7f7-c923-4cd4-814a-e08c34baf60b/f5166605-38e6-4c90-b937-5fc0da2d55a3).

These additional disclosures for California residents apply only to individuals who reside in California. The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended and together with all applicable regulations (“CCPA”) provides additional rights to know, delete and opt out, and requires businesses collecting or disclosing personal information to provide notices and means to exercise those rights. The words used in this section have the meanings given to them in the CCPA, which may be broader than their common meaning. For example, the definition of “personal information” under the CCPA includes your name, but also more general information such as age.

#### Notice of Collection

The categories of personal information that we may have collected – as described by the CCPA – in the past 12 months are:

#### California Do Not Track Disclosure

Certain web browsers may allow you to enable a “do not track” option that sends signals to the websites you visit indicating that you do not want your online activities tracked. This is different than blocking cookies as browsers with the “do not track” option selected may still accept cookies. Right now, there is no industry standard for how companies should respond to “do not track” signals, although one may be adopted in the future. We do not respond to “do not track” signals at this time. If we do so in the future, we will modify this Policy accordingly. More information about “do not track” is available at [www.allaboutdnt.com](https://www.bibleminute.co/www.allaboutdnt.com).
