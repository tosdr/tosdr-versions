Payments are being processed by a third party in its exclusive responsibility. Configo will not be liable for the actions and omissions of such third party providers. Your use of payment processing service may be subject to terms and conditions posted within, adjacent to or linked to the payment process. You hereby authorize the payment processor to provide data and information to Configo. Configo is free to replace the payment processor service from time to time or process payments by itself.

###### **Advertiser Payments**

Credit card details are needed to complete an order, and the Service will be available only following successful completion of billing. You will be notified accordingly. You authorize Configo to continue to charge your credit card or any replacement card for agreed amounts, and failure to charge your card does not derogate from your payment obligation. If Configo is unable to charge its fees through your approved payment means, Configo may, in addition to other remedies, suspend or terminate the services granted to you.

All fees charged from Advertisers are, except where otherwise explicitly stated, exclusive of all taxes, including, without limitation VAT. Israeli VAT, if applicable, shall be added to any payment against a tax invoice. Advertisers undertakes to make all payments without deduction for or on account of, any tax, levy, deduction, charge or withholding imposed by any governmental agency.

Late payments shall accrue compounded interest at a rate of the lesser of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the highest rate allowed by applicable law. You will be responsible for all expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by Configo in collecting any late payment.

###### **Publisher Payments**

Payment to a Publisher shall be made on a monthly basis, by the 15th day of each month with respect to the preceding month. Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, in no event will Configo be required to pay to Publisher unless and until at least the Threshold Amount has been accumulated in Publisher’s account, and therefore in the event that, in any given month, the Publisher has failed to reach at least the Threshold Amount by the end of a calendar month, any accumulated due Publisher fees shall be carried over and added to the next month’s Publisher fees, until the earlier of: (a) the month in which such Threshold Amount is met; or (b) December 31st of the respective year. The “**Threshold Amount**” is currently US $20 and may be changed by Configo, from time to time, at its sole discretion.

Publisher shall not be entitled to payment in the event that the Advertiser fails to pay, or in the event that Configo refunds the Advertiser.
