![](./thumbnail/15.png)

New Season for the Battle Pass: Winter!

	- More skins are available in the chests
	- A new battle pass with new cosmetics

Oh boy this one's a doozy!

Reinvented the building system
	How it works:
		- Builds are now separated in categories
			- Currently there are only 2 categories
		- Each category can be selected with the new Building Slot keybinds
		- With a category selected, you can cycle through builds with right click
			- This should work like the old system
			- When selecting a category, the first build is always selected
	But why?
		- To allow for more flexibility with builds
			- For a more organized selection from the player
			- And a more streamlined development process
		- The old building system was simple and functional but not easily expandable
		- But also to not have the player cycle though tons of builds
	We're always looking for feedback and issues
		- If you'd like to do either join our discord server!

New buildable items!
	Tired of low health of walls and people jumping over?
		Introducing the Fortified Wall!
		- Boasting 150 HP and blocking flying projectiles and jumping players
		- Costs 10 brick and 10 metal to build
	Low health with no bandages?
		Introducing the Campfire!
		- Heals any player in a small (sometimes visible) radius around it
		- Costs 20 wood to build

Introducing throwing- specifically grenades!
	Throwables can be cooked/charged by holding left click
	There are various interactions with them:
	- Charging them can increase their speed and lower the timer
	- If the timer runs out the throwable might be discarded
	- Releasing left click will perform an "underhand throw" which throws the throwable at a reasonable distance
	- Right clicking at any point will perform an "overhand throw" which has a much higher velocity
	- Switching from the throwable while its being charged causes it to be discard, falling on the ground

New throwable items!
	Grenades!
	- Can be charged up to 4s to increase their distance and lower the timer when released
	- Holding it past will cause the grenade to explode on the spot
	- When exploding the grenade will deal 80 damage in a 3 tile radius
	Smoke Grenades!
	- After being thrown they produce giant smoke that blocks vision
	- Charging it fully causes smoke to produce right after the nade is thrown

Did someone ask for more shotguns?
	Introducing the SPAS12!
	- Long range shotgun with 4 shells and high damage
	- Boasts a fast bullet speed paired with decent damage

Misc Changes:
	- Airdrops fall twice as slow as before
	- Meteor and Airdrop pings last x2 longer

Balance Changes:
	- Revolver has been nerfed
		- Less damage overall
		- Slower shooting
		- Slower reloading

			- A unique weapon
