(a) carsales publishes or makes available on the carsales Network information, advertisements, products and services, vehicle data, valuations, software and other content supplied by carsales and third parties (“Material”).

(b) To the extent permitted by law, carsales does not warrant or endorse the accuracy or completeness of, or the representations made in, the Material, or any information received as a result of using the carsales Network (including via links to third party websites).

(c) Unless expressly stated by carsales and to the extent permitted by law, carsales does not provide any warranty in relation to any goods or services advertised for sale on the carsales Network by third parties including, but not limited to, any representation or warranty that the goods or services are of merchantable quality, fit or safe for the purpose intended, as described by the seller or owned by the seller.

### 2\. Personal and non-commercial use only

(a) Unless you have signed commercial terms with carsales, use of the carsales Network is for your personal and non-commercial use only. Except for the Material held in your computer’s cache or a single permanent copy of the Material for your personal use, or where you must undertake such activities to exercise your legal rights (for example to use screen-reading software for accessibility), you must not without the prior written approval of carsales (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) do any of the following or authorise a third party to do that thing on your behalf:

1. modify, copy, distribute, transmit, display, perform, reproduce, publish or license any Material;
2. use or attempt to use any Material to create any website, publication or searchable database;
3. mirror or frame any website or Material from the carsales Network;
4. use an automated process of any sort to query, access, retrieve, scrape, data-mine or copy any Material or generate or compile any document, index or database based on the Material;
5. use any manual process to make multiple copies of Material or to compile any document, index or database based on the Material;
6. publish, transfer or sell any Material, information or functionality derived from the carsales Network; or
7. undertake any other action which is in violation of these Terms (or other terms and conditions referred to in these Terms), contrary to good faith, or in breach of any applicable law.

(b) If carsales reasonably considers that you or any party related to you has acted contrary to these Terms, then carsales may immediately terminate your right to access and use the carsales Network and reserves its right to take any action it deems reasonably necessary or desirable to prevent such repeated action.

### 3\. You are responsible for use of the carsales Network

(a) The Material made available on (or via) the carsales Network is provided as general information only. The Material is not professional, expert or other advice and it is not a substitute for such advice. The Material may not be appropriate, correct or sufficient for your circumstances, should not be relied on as the only reason you do or don't do anything, and may not be continually accessible or free from errors or viruses.

(b) You indemnify carsales against any liability, loss, claim or demand if carsales (or any of its officers, representatives, employees or agents) suffers any loss or damage or incurs any cost in connection with a breach by you (or any of your officers, representatives, employees or agents) of these Terms- including any warranties you provide in them except to the extent such loss or damage is caused by carsales’ own acts or omissions.

(c) You must keep your username and password to access the carsales Network secure and confidential and not provide those details to any third party. You accept all liability relating to unauthorised use of any username and password issued to you which is due to no fault of carsales.

### 4\. Goods and services provided by carsales

Any goods or services offered by carsales (beyond access to the carsales Network) are subject to additional terms and conditions. To the extent of any inconsistency between these Terms and the additional terms and conditions, the additional terms and conditions will prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.

### 5\. Goods and services provided by third parties

(a) If goods and services are offered on the carsales Network by third parties (sellers), to the extent permitted by law:

1. vehicle prices often exclude delivery, government and statutory charges (always check with the seller);
2. you are responsible for making all relevant searches, enquiries and investigations in relation to the goods and services including searching any written off vehicle register or register of security interests (including the Personal Property Securities Register);

For the purpose of these Terms, “person” means any legal entity, including an individual or business.

(b) carsales may augment information supplied by sellers, for example by using the make, model and series provided by a seller to suggest vehicle features. This information relies upon the seller accurately identifying their vehicle and also on information provided to carsales from third parties (for example original equipment manufacturers).

### 14\. Terms applicable to carsales Network Stores

carsales operates the Stores which allow third party retailers (each a “Seller”) to list and sell goods or services and transact directly with customers. As a result, carsales is not a party to any transaction between you and the Seller that occurs via the Stores. In addition, carsales does not control the content or accuracy of any product listing or the quality, shipping, delivery or returns approvals of any goods or services sold via the Stores. Without limiting any other provision of these Terms, the following additional terms apply to your use of and access to the Stores:

1. As the Stores are platforms for Sellers to list for sale and sell their goods or services to customers, you agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by law, carsales is not responsible for the transactions that occur between you and a Seller, nor is carsales responsible for any of the Seller’s goods or services. To the maximum extent permitted by law, carsales makes no warranty or representation regarding the standard of any goods or services to be supplied by a Seller or the actions, omissions or conduct of a Seller.
2. All information about goods or services listed for sale in the Stores (including without limitation all product descriptions, images and specifications, pricing information and the policies referred to in paragraphs (e) and (f) below) is provided by the relevant Sellers. Except as required by law, carsales is not responsible for any inaccuracies, misstatements or errors in this information. You agree to make your own enquiries to verify the information provided and to assess the suitability of goods or services before you order the goods or services through the Stores.
3. A listing in the Stores will contain the relevant Seller’s details. When you make an order through the Stores, you acknowledge and agree that the Seller may impose their own terms and conditions in relation to the sale of their goods or services, which will be displayed or otherwise made available to you through the Store (including without limitation the policies that are described further in paragraphs (e) and (f) below). Unless expressly permitted by carsales in writing, carsales will not be a party to any agreement or additional terms that apply between you and a Seller.
4. To the extent permitted by law the promotion of goods or services via the Stores is an invitation to treat- not an offer to sell.
5. The Seller’s applicable policy for cancellations, returns (including repairs and replacements) and refunds will apply to any transaction between you and that Seller via the Stores. The collection, use and disclosure of your personal information may also be subject to the Seller’s privacy policy. Before purchasing goods or services via the Stores, you should carefully read the Seller’s cancellation, return and refund policy, which will be displayed or otherwise made available to you through the Stores.
6. The Seller’s applicable policy for shipping and delivery of goods or services will apply to any transaction between you and that Seller via the Stores. Before purchasing goods or services via the Stores, you should carefully read the Seller’s shipping and delivery policy, which will be displayed or otherwise made available to you through the Stores.
7. When an order is placed for a Seller’s goods or services, you will receive an email confirmation that your order has been placed and carsales will send the order to the Seller for confirmation. Whilst stock levels are regularly adjusted, on occasion a Seller may reject your order in its discretion. Where a Seller rejects your order, you will be notified by email and carsales will refund you for the order and associated shipping charges to the relevant payment method used for purchase. You are responsible for any loss arising from discrepancies or errors in your order caused by due to no fault of carsales.
8. The prices of goods or services, delivery and other charges are shown in Australian dollars. All payments must be received by carsales in full prior to the dispatch of goods or services by a Seller. If your payment is not received or is declined for any reason, including where fraud is suspected, your order will be cancelled and, if applicable, you will receive a refund of your order to the relevant payment method used for purchase.
9. To cancel, return or request a refund from a Seller or raise a problem with the goods or services purchased from a Seller, you should submit a request to us via the relevant ‘Help Centre’ for the Store you used. carsales will then investigate the issue further, submit your request on your behalf to the relevant Seller (as necessary) and provide reasonable assistance to you in relation to pursuing resolution of the issue. Where a refund is permitted in accordance with the Seller’s policies, your refund will be issued using the same payment method used for purchase. Where carsales considers that it cannot reasonably resolve the issue, it may require you to liaise directly with the Seller to pursue a resolution.
10. You must not use the Stores unless you are aged 18-years-old or older and by making an order for goods or services through the Stores, you warrant to us that you are aged 18-years-old or older, and that you have the legal right and capacity to order goods or services through the Stores.
