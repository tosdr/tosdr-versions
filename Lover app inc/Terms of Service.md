All fees are in the currency listed at point of sale and, unless otherwise stated, are non-refundable. To make a purchase via the Services (described in Section 4.2 below) you must be 18 years or older and capable of forming a binding contract.

​

4.3. Subscription Services; Automatic Renewal. If you activate or update Subscription Services through our Services, you authorize Lover App to periodically charge, on a going-forward basis and until cancellation of either the recurring payments or your Account, all accrued sums on or before the payment due date for the accrued sums.

After your initial Subscription period, and again after any subsequent Subscription period, your Subscription will automatically commence on the first day following the end of such period and continue for an equivalent period, at Lover App’s then- current price for such Subscription.

You will not be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the fees paid for the then current period of your Subscription. Upon renewal of your Subscription, if Lover App does not receive payment from your Payment Provider, (i) you agree to pay all amounts due on your Account upon demand, and/or (ii) you agree that Lover App may either terminate or suspend your Subscription and continue to attempt to charge your Payment Provider until payment is received (upon receipt of payment, your Account will be activated and for purposes of automatic renewal, your new Subscription period will begin as of the day payment was received).

​

4.4. Free Trials. Certain Paid Services, including Subscription Services, may offer a free trial prior to charging your payment method, the period of which will be communicated to you via the Services. If you decide to stop use of the Paid Services or cancel your Subscription before Lover App starts charging your payment method, you must stop use of the Paid Services or cancel the Subscription before the free trial ends. Otherwise, you will be responsible for payment for any further use of the Paid Services or the full term of the Subscription period.

4.5. Taxes. Lover App’s fees are net of any applicable Sales Tax. If any Services, or payments for any Services, under the Terms are subject to Sales Tax in any jurisdiction and you have not remitted the applicable Sales Tax to Lover App, you will be responsible for the payment of such Sales Tax and any related penalties or interest to the relevant tax authority, and you will indemnify Lover App for any liability or expense we may incur in connection with such Sales Taxes. Upon our request, you will provide us with official receipts issued by the appropriate taxing authority, or other such evidence that you have paid all applicable taxes. For purposes of this section, “Sales Tax” shall mean any sales or use tax, and any other tax measured by sales proceeds, that Lover App is permitted to pass to its customers, that is the functional equivalent of a sales tax where the applicable taxing jurisdiction does not otherwise impose a sales or use tax.

​

4.6. Withholding Taxes. You agree to make all payments of fees to Lover App free and clear of, and without reduction for, any withholding taxes. Any such taxes imposed on payments of fees to Lover App will be your sole responsibility, and you will provide Lover App with official receipts issued by the appropriate taxing authority, or such other evidence as we may reasonably request, to establish that such taxes have been paid.

​

4.8. Disputes. You must notify us in writing if you have any concerns or objections regarding charges, and you agree not to cancel or reject any credit card or third-party payment processing charges unless you have made a reasonable attempt at resolving the matter directly with Lover App. We reserve the right to not process or to cancel your order in certain circumstances, including but not limited to instances in which your credit card is declined, we suspect the request or order is fraudulent, or in other circumstances that we deem appropriate in our sole discretion. You must give notice of any disputed charges within seven (7) days after receiving your credit card statement if you dispute any of our charges on that statement or such dispute will be deemed waived.

You agree that any dispute or claim relating in any way to your access or use of the Services or to any aspect of your relationship with Lover App, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (a) you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify; and (b) you or Lover App may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all claims that arose or were asserted before the date you accepted the Terms of this Agreement or any prior version of this Agreement.

​

16.2. Arbitration Rules and Forum. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent: Jas Bagniewski, 1295 Laurel Hill Drive, San Mateo, CA 94402. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this “Dispute Resolution” section. (The AAA Rules are available by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section. A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a general Demand for Arbitration form and a separate form for Demand for Arbitration for California residents.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules. Unless you and Lover App Inc otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and Lover App Inc submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.

​

16.3. Decision of Arbitrator. The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Lover App Inc will not seek, and hereby waives all rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.

​

16.4. Fees. Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, We will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).

​

16.5. Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND LOVER APP HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and Lover App are instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 16.1 above. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.

​

16.6. Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this Section’s limitations as to a given claim for relief, then that claim must be severed from the arbitration and brought into the State or Federal Courts located in the State of California. All other claims shall be arbitrated.

​

16.7. 30-Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending an email to [](mailto:support@lover.io)[support@lover.io](mailto:support@lover.io) within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name, your Lover App username (if any), the email address you used to set up your Account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.

​

16.8. Severability. Except as provided in Section 16.5, if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.

​

16.9. Survival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Lover App.

​

16.10. Modification. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Lover App makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, you may reject that change within thirty (30) days of such change becoming effective by emailing Lover App at [](mailto:support@lover.io)[support@lover.io](mailto:support@lover.io).
