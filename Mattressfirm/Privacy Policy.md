Maintaining your privacy is part of that commitment.

††Offer available 7/16/24-10/1/24 at participating Mattress Firm stores only. Taxes and delivery fees must be paid upfront and cannot be charged to your Mattress Firm credit card; upfront payment of taxes and delivery fees will not reduce monthly payment or amount financed. Qualifying purchase is determined prior to taxes and delivery fees. A promo fee, equal to 2% of the amount financed at time of purchase, will be shown as a separate transaction on your billing statement and included in the balance subject to this promo. Any taxes, delivery or other charges included in the amount financed will increase the related promo fee and the required monthly payments.

Qualifying purchase amount must be on one receipt. No interest will be charged on the amount financed (including related promo fee) and equal monthly payments are required on such balance until it is paid in full. The payments equal the amount financed (including related promo fee) divided by the number of months in the promo period, rounded up to the next cent. These payments may be higher than the payments that would be required if this purchase was a non-promo purchase. During the last month(s) of the promo period the required monthly payment may be reduced due to the prior months’ rounding. Regular account terms apply to non-promo purchases. For New Accounts: As of 7/16/2024: Purchase APR is 34.99%. Penalty APR is 39.99%. Minimum Interest Charge is $2. Existing cardholders: See your credit card agreement terms.
