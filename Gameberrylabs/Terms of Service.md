#### REWARDS

* Gameberry may offer one or more rewards (“Rewards”) through specific activities such as advertisements, games, surveys, quizzes etc. (“Activities”), wherein the users may be able to either earn points, which can be redeemed for Rewards or the users may directly receive the Rewards.
* Not all of Gameberry’s Activities will carry Rewards. Some of the Activities may include additional terms that apply to your participation in the Activities allowing you to earn points or Rewards. Points awarded have no cash value.
* Gameberry may limit, suspend or terminate Your ability to participate in Activities in its sole and absolute discretion, and may void any points, Rewards, or potential Rewards you may have earned or accumulated, if Gameberry determines in its sole discretion that You have not complied with these Terms or any additional terms applicable to such participation. The decision tendered by Gameberry in this regard will be final and binding on You.
* Gameberry reserves the right to change, suspend, or cancel all or a portion of the Activities, including any points or Rewards You may have accrued, at any time.

No credit, reversal, or refund of points will be issued for any reason after points have been redeemed; in other words, once you order a reward, you may not cancel the reward or return the reward for a refund of points.
* Rewards and/or earned points are non-transferable, may not be bartered or sold, and are void if a transfer is attempted.
* Any Account that has not been logged into and points either earned or redeemed for one year or more may be deemed inactive and the Account closed. We may either close the Account completely or remove any points in the Account and treat it as inactive, as we elect.
