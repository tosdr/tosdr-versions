Terms of Service
================

This agreement governs your relationship with Flightsim.to and use of the services provided through this website.

  

This is a legally-binding contract. Please read these terms of service carefully. This agreement governs your relationship with Flightsim.to and use of the services provided through this website. These terms of use describe your use of this website ("We", "Site", "Platform", "Flightsim.to", "Service") and by using this site you ("User", "Customer", "End customer", "You") agree to be bound by these terms. Please note that the privacy policy is also part of these terms. You agree to use the Website and Services only for purposes permitted by these Terms of Service as well as any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions. 

### **Who are we?** 

Please find our contact details in the [Contacts](https://flightsim.to/legal/contact) section. Flightsim.to essentially provides a free service that allows users to upload, promote and showcase content that other users can download, view, comment, interact with or follow. 

### **When do these terms apply?**

If you signed up on or after 24 February 2023, these terms apply immediately. If you signed up before 24 February 2023, these terms will apply as soon as you agree to these terms after you have been notified by us. These terms will apply from 5 March 2023 at the latest, unless you have deleted or deactivated your account before that date.

### Section 1 - Account Creation

**§ 1** You may be required to create a user account in order to use or access certain aspects of the Site. You agree that all of the details you provide in connection with your account are about yourself and not about another individual. All information you provide have to be accurate and up to date. You are responsible for your account yourself and have to make sure that no third party or any other individual can access it. Customer accounts are not transferable. Granting access to third parties is expressly prohibited. The holder of the customer account is responsible for all activities on his account. In the case of unauthorised activities - especially those against our Terms of Use - the Site reserves the right to close the customer account temporarily or completely without further notice.

**§ 1.1** If you are a citizen of the European Union, you need to be at least 16 years old in order to use the Service, or you may need to do so with a parent's or legal guardian's consent. This Site may require proof of such age or consent. You are not allowed to use this Site if such age or consent is not given. 

### Section 2 - Account Suspension and Termination

**§ 2** You agree that the Site has the right, at its sole discretion, to investigate any actual or suspected violation of these Terms of Use and to suspend or terminate your account and refuse you access to your account or the Site for any reason, including if we believe that you have violated these Terms of Use or any applicable law.

**§ 2.1** You can terminate or close your account at Flightsim.to at any time and you can stop using the Site at any time. To close or delete your account permanently, you need to expressly inform us that you want to close or permanently delete your account. We will then remove and delete all data associated with your User account unless stated otherwise in these terms. The Privacy Policy applies. 

### Section 3 - Account Security

**§ 3** You may not use anyone else's account at any time and you may not allow anyone else to use your account at any time. You are responsible for all activity occurring under your account, including all activities or transactions conducted through the use of your account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account username and password, and agree not to disclose your username and password to anyone. You agree not to transfer, resell, or otherwise convey your account or the right to use your account to anyone. You agree that this Site will not be liable for any loss you may incur as a result of someone else using your account, either with or without your knowledge. If you have reason to believe that your Account is no longer secure, you must: (i) promptly change your password; and (ii) immediately notify us of the problem through our contact page.

**§ 3.1** Section § 3 does not apply if the unauthorised access to your account was caused by an intentional or grossly negligent breach of duty on the part of the Site and if it can be excluded that you are substantially at fault. 

### Section 4 - User Content

The terms and conditions set out in Section § 4 do not apply if you are using our platform as part of your vendor account.

**§ 4** Certain aspects of the Site may allow you to submit or post a variety of content to the Site, such as text, images, files, videos, and other content, either directly to the Service or through a Third Party Service (collectively, "**User Content**"). Please be aware that User Content is not confidential and may be accessible by other users and the public.

**§ 4.1** If you choose to upload User Content, you must not submit to the Service any User Content that does not comply with these terms or the law. For example, the User Content you submit must not include third-party intellectual property (such as copyrighted material) unless you have permission from that party or are otherwise legally entitled to do so (including by way of any available exceptions or limitations to copyright or related rights provided for in European Union law). You are legally responsible for the User Content you submit to the Service. We may use automated systems that analyze your User Content to help detect infringement and abuse, such as spam, malware, and illegal content. Material that is considered illegal under German, English, or United States law, such as pornographic representations of sexual violence, inappropriate images of minors, bestiality, necrophilia, etc., is strictly forbidden and will lead to administrative measures. In appropriate circumstances, the relevant authorities will also be informed.

**§ 4.1.1** You assure that any contribution you make on this Website follows these standards and will be held accountable by us. Should there be a violation of this assurance, you agree to compensate us for any losses or damages we incur. This holds you responsible for any harm we face as a result of your breach of warranty.

* * *

**§ 4.2** You retain all of your ownership and intellectual property rights in your User Content. In short, what belongs to you stays yours. However, we do require you to grant certain rights to the Platform and other users of the Service. You are required to grant (a) us a limited license to use, store, host and copy your User Content and to distribute and make it available to third parties; (b) other users of our site a limited license to use, access and download that content for their own recreational purposes; and (c) the licenses described in the following paragraphs.

**§ 4.2.1** The grant of rights is subject to the limitation that you may not grant us any rights to the extent that you do not possess such rights yourself or are not entitled to grant such rights. If you upload User Content that includes another party's copyright or intellectual property, any terms of the third-party content's End User License Agreement (EULA) or contracts shall take precedence over these terms to the extent of any conflict. Subject to any agreement you have with any third-party, you retain all rights to your User Content, and you are responsible for protecting those rights. Any third-party retains all of its intellectual property rights, copyright and trademarks associated with the User Content. You represent and warrant that you have the right to grant us the licenses in this Section and such grant does not violate any rights of any third-party. This Site will not claim any of these rights protected by third-parties. 

**§ 4.3** When you submit or post User Content to the Service, either directly or through a Third Party Service, you are granting this Site a worldwide, non-exclusive, assignable, unrestricted, sublicensable, perpetual, irrevocable, and royalty-free license to use the User Content. This license includes all consents or waivers necessary to distribute, publicly perform, publicly display, modify the User Content for the purposes of Site moderation, optimization and operation, transmit, host, share, keep available, communicate to the public, and advertise, feature, or promote the User Content in connection with the service provided by the Website and across different media now known or developed in the future without further notice or permission from you or any other person, and without compensation to you or any other person, (if applicable) only to the extent that such license grant is not limited or restricted by any third-party EULA of content that is included in your User Content. Modification of User Content may include, but is not limited to, comment moderation, modification of uploaded images (such as adding watermarks, applying auto-optimization filters, converting them into other file formats, changing filenames), modifying the description, categorization, tags, posted text contents and other characteristics of your User Content, or modifying your user-generated account information or similar. Each license grant does not affect any intellectual property rights or applicable copyright law. 

**§ 4.3.1** You are granting us this license for the purpose of enabling us to fulfill the spirit, legitimate interest and purpose of our Website and to offer, operate, improve and enhance our services. The Site is not allowed to sell, bill, charge a fee to access, claim ownership or intellectual property, to your User Content without your express permission. The Site may use your User Content solely in connection with the Flightsim.to services and only to the extent required therefore. 

**§ 4.4** You grant to the Platform the right to monetize your User Content on the Service, which may include displaying ads on or within User Content. For the sake of clarity, these terms do not entitle you to any payments.

**§ 4.5** You are granting each other user of the Service a worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual, and royalty-free license to access, download and use your User Content through the Service. This license allows users to use the User Content for their own recreational purposes and in accordance with the purpose of the Website, which is to enable users to download video game mods for their personal use and enjoyment, forever. 

**§ 4.6** You can delete your User Content from the Service at any time without reason, unless otherwise stated in this agreement. Upon deletion, this Site shall discontinue to distribute, host or make available the User Content and irrevocably delete it from the Site's servers, except where you permitted the further use of User Content after your removal, or the law requires otherwise. For example, removal of User Content by you does not require the Platform to: (a) recall User Content that is being used by other users within any limited offline viewing functionality of the Service; (b) delete copies we reasonably need to keep for legal purposes; (c) delete backup copies we need to keep for a reasonable period of time; (d) remove your User Content within User Content of others when they have not deleted your User Content; (e) remove content pages including User Content of other users or statistical information; (f) remove or hide third-party User Content related or in connection with your User Content, such as third-party comments, ratings or similar information. When we delete User Content, it is removed in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer. You should be aware that removed content will persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time, which however are not accessible to others. 

**§ 4.6.1** Certain User Content may not be archived, disabled, hidden, removed or deleted (collectively, "deletion") without giving the Site prior notice of such deletion (File Termination Period - period between the time of notification and the actual deletion). In the cases listed below - and only in these -, the Site reserves the right to keep your User Content available for others to retrieve, access and download until the File Termination Period has elapsed. Following the end of the File Terminiation Period, the file will be deleted in accordance with Section 4.6 of these terms. The purpose of this provision is to ensure that any User Content that other users may rely on or reference, such as in collaborative, libraries or group projects, remains available until a reasonable period has passed, or to ensure that the removal of content does not disrupt the functioning and purpose of the Site. Compliance with the File Termination Period can be waived under certain special circumstances, for instance, if there is an urgency that requires the immediate removal of the content, or if the individual case presents a different and valid justification for a waiver, the Site may allow the removal of the content without waiting for the File Termination Period to expire. In such cases, the Site may take appropriate measures to ensure that the rights and interests of other users are not infringed upon, and that the functioning and security of the Site are not compromised. However, any such waiver or exception to the File Termination Period must be clearly communicated to the Site and should be agreed upon by all parties involved.

| Case | File Termination Period |
| --- | --- |
| **Libraries**  <br>_Files uploaded in the Library category or made for other users to use or reference within their own User Content_ | 90 days |
| **Standalone Aircraft**  <br>_Files uploaded in the Aircraft category or aircraft for or on which other users have shared own User Content_ | 45 days |
| **Popular or Trending User Content**  <br>_Files with about 25,000 downloads or more, including files which have seen more than 1,000 unique downloads within the last 24 hours_ | 14 days |
| **Featured User Content**  <br>_User Content that has been shared, advertised, promoted, highlighted or otherwise featured by the Site on social media, news or similar media channels_ | 60 days |
| **Community Request Fulfillments**  <br>_Files which have been assigned to a request or created in response to a request published on the Website's Requests section_ | 30 days |

  

**§ 4.7** If you decide to end this Agreement with us, to close or delete your User account, or if we discontinue, suspend or limit your access to the Site, Flightsim.to will remove your User Content in accordance with Section 4.6 upon request, unless a File Termination Period in accordance with Section 4.6.1 applies. If you decide to delete your account without waiting for the File Termination Period to expire, the Site may transfer your User Content to an temporary account set up by the Site to keep your User Content available for the period provided in compliance with Section 4.6.1 of these terms.

**§ 4.8** For the sake of clarity: You only retain the rights to the files you have uploaded to this Website. You do not possess the rights to files or content created by others that may have resulted from your content being accessible on any page of this Website, including but not limited to: ratings, comments, images created by other users, articles or information about your content, any related statistical information, the overall page your User Content is featured on, and the User Content of others. In order to keep third-party User Content available, the Site may keep the relevant pages, contents and statistical information available to the public, such may include images, screenshots, changelogs, descriptions and other non-personalized information related or in connection with your User Content, even if originating from or uploaded by yourself. 

* * *

**§ 4.9** This site allows users to set their preferred terms for the reuse of their work within the site through various permission settings specific to each file. These permissions are not binding to Flightsim.to in any way, but are merely an indication to other users of how the uploader of a particular file wishes to control its redistribution. If another user violates the posted permissions, their account may be subject to moderation at our sole discretion. It is up to the uploader/user to enforce their rights against users who may be violating their redistribution policy. The permissions granted to other users will remain even if the author stops using this Website or their account is terminated. Obviously, chosen permission settings are only valid to the extent permitted by law. 

**§ 4.10** Please retain copies of all your User Content as this Site is under no obligation to store or return any User Content to you. You are solely responsible for your User Content. This Site only acts as a passive conduit for User Content, and will not be liable for any use, disclosure, or exposure of any User Content, including possibly objectionable or offensive User Content, to you, any other user, or any third party. Flightsim.to is under no obligation to monitor User Content or use of the Site. However, this Site has the right to monitor or moderate User Content, in our sole discretion, and to enforce our or a third party’s intellectual property rights in any User Content. Flightsim.to reserves the right to discard or remove User Content from the Site in its sole discretion and without any liability.

**§ 4.11** You represent and warrant the following as to your User Content: Your User Content does not infringe, violate, or misappropriate any third-party intellectual property rights, including copyrights or trademarks. Your User Content, as used in connection with the Site, will not violate any applicable laws or regulations or infringe or violate any rights of a third party. You will indemnify Flightsim.to on first demand against all claims that your User Content is unlawful and you will be fully liable for all costs and damages incurred by Flightsim.to as a result of your unlawful content.

### Section P - Terms of the Flightsim.to Premium Membership

**§ P1** This Section describes the terms and conditions for the Premium Membership at Flightsim.to. Where this constitutes a conflict between the Website Terms and Conditions and the terms in this Section, these terms shall prevail. Please read these terms carefully before you purchase Flightsim.to Premium.

**§ P2** Your Flightsim.to Premium Membership begins with our acceptance of your purchase. Our acception will take place when we email you to accept it, at which point a contract will come into existence between you and us. If we are unable to accept your purchase, we will inform you of this and will not charge you for the purchase. You will have access to the Premium Membership benefits once you have paid the relevant purchase fee in full after our acceptance, for the period you selected during purchase.

**§ P3** We reserve the right to modify the Premium Membership in order to: (a) comply with changes in applicable laws and regulations, and (b) incorporate minor technical enhancements and improvements, such as addressing security concerns. These changes will not have an impact on your use of the Premium Membership.

**§ P4** We cannot be held accountable for any delays or service interruptions that are beyond our control. If access to the Premium Membership is delayed or interrupted due to circumstances beyond our control, we will notify you as soon as possible and take steps to minimize the impact of the delay or interruption. In such cases, we will not be responsible for the delay or interruption, but if there is a substantial risk of a prolonged delay or interruption, you have the option to end your Membership and receive a refund for any Premium Membership fees that you have already paid but have not yet received.

**§ P5** Suspension. The Premium Membership ends at the end of the day on which the period for which you purchased Flightsim.to Premium ends. For instance, if you have purchased Flightsim.to Premium for 30 days, your membership will automatically end at the end of the 30 days. It is not necessary to cancel your membership separately. The membership expires automatically. If you wish to continue using Flightsim.to Premium after your initial chosen period, you must purchase it again.

**§ P5.1** We may end your Membership if you break any of these terms or any other terms which apply to the Website. In these cases, we may end your Membership at any time, and we are not required to issue any refund to you as you are in breach of the contract.

**§ P6** You may have a statutory right of withdrawal. You may be able to withdraw from your purchase within 14 days if you change your mind. You need to contact and inform us of this decision within the withdrawal period. However, you are obligated to compensate us for the Premium Membership benefits utilized until the point at which you inform us of your change of decision, which is, for every day of the Premium Membership period, you must pay 5% of the Membership fee. If you are entitled to a refund, we will pay this to you by the method you used for payment. However, we may make deductions from the price, as described above.

**§ P6.1** Other than legally provided reasons for revocation or withdrawal, we do not recognize any other refund or return rights.

**§ P7** The Premium Membership cannot and may not be shared with other users. It is forbidden to pass on access data to other persons and this contract is only effective between you as the purchaser of the Premium Membership and us. You need our consent to transfer your rights to someone else. Unlawful or forbidden sharing of the Premium Membership with any third party without our prior consent is a breach of this Agreement and may result in immediate termination.

**§ P8** We are responsible for any foreseeable losses or damages caused by us in the provision of the Premium Membership. If we breach these terms or fail to exercise reasonable care and skill, we are liable for the foreseeable losses or damages that result, but not for those that are not foreseeable. Loss or damage is considered foreseeable if it was either evident or known to both parties at the time the agreement was made. There are some instances where our liability cannot be limited or excluded, such as in cases of death or personal injury caused by our negligence or that of our employees, agents, or subcontractors, fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation, or violation of your legal rights related to the Premium Membership. We are not responsible for losses incurred in the course of conducting business. The Premium Membership is intended for personal and domestic use only, and if used for commercial or business purposes, we will not be liable for any loss of profit, business interruption, or opportunity.

**§ P9** In all other respects, the other terms and conditions of these Terms of Use shall apply.

If you are unable to complete a download or access a Product, please contact the Site's customer service for assistance. We will usually continue making Products you have purchased available to you in your Site's account so that you can download additional copies of the Product and retrieve your license key (if applicable), but that is not always the case, and we may limit or disable further downloads of a Product due to licensing restrictions or for other reasons. The permanent provision of backup files, downloadable files, receipts and Product license keys in your account is a free service of Flightsim.to.

### Section C - Terms of the Flightsim.to Creators Program 

**§ C1** This Section describes the terms and conditions for the Creators Program at Flightsim.to. Where this a conflict between the Website Terms and Conditions and the terms in this Section, these terms shall prevail. Please read these terms carefully before you opt-in to Flightsim.to Creators Program. 

**§ C2** The Flightsim.to Creators Program provides content creators at Flightsim.to the opportunity to “opt-in” in order to receive donations from other users through Flightsim.to, and rewards based upon certain metrics that Flightsim.to determines at its sole discretion. It is important to emphasize that donations made directly to the creators through platforms such as PayPal or Buy Me a Coffee are excluded from the scope of the Creators Program and these terms. The Creators Program is a selective program that requires an application process and is open only to approved Creators. For example, it allows users to buy credit on Flightsim.to, and then spend that credit on donations to Creators.

**§ C3** In order to apply for the Creators Program, you must be at least **18 years of age** and possess an active Flightsim.to account that has published at least three mods with a total download count of at least 10,000 downloads. This is only a basic guideline from which Flightsim.to may deviate at its sole discretion. There is no claim for inclusion in the Flightsim.to Creators Program. To make a mod eligible for our  Creators Program, it must be opted-in through the Mod Reward management page. If you are a part of a team of mod creators, you may register on behalf of the team, but you will be solely responsible for dividing any earnings among your team members. We will not be involved in the distribution of earnings between team members. 

**§ C4** For a mod to be eligible for the Creators Program, it must meet one of the following requirements: (a) it must consist solely of your original work, (b) it must consist of your original work and / or assets that have been cleared for general commercialization, (c) it must consist of the above and/or assets that are not your original work and not licensed for general commercialization, but for which you have obtained explicit permission from the asset authors to use for such commercial use case.

**§ C5** Earnings may be acquired in various ways, which are subject to change at the discretion of Flightsim.to, including, but not limited to: (1) unique downloads of your mods over a specified time frame; (2) a portion of credits from other users who choose to share with you; (3) participating in contests or promotions that offer Earnings as a reward; (4) engaging in other activities that allow such earnings. Flightsim.to has sole discretion over: (a) how Earnings are earned; (b) the amount of Earnings earned from each activity; and (c) the timing of the distribution of such Earnings, if any, to you. Flightsim.to reserves the right to add or remove methods of earning or to discontinue the Creators Program, for any reason or no reason at all.

**§ C6** You acknowledge and agree that your participation in the Creators Program does not guarantee the earning anything. Flightsim.to makes no representations, warranties or guarantees that you will receive any Earnings through your participation in the Creators Program. 

**§ C7** To redeem your earnings, you must have a linked PayPal account in your Flightsim.to account and have sufficient Earnings to withdraw the specified amount. That means, your Earnings must at least exceed 25.00,- USD. Cash redemptions are only available in United States Dollars (USD($)) and can only be redeemed in whole numbers. The conversion of USD($) to your local currency will be handled by PayPal, and Flightsim.to will not be responsible for any fees incurred from PayPal's services. It is your responsibility to ensure that your PayPal email is entered correctly. If a PayPal withdrawal is unavailable due to PayPal's national or other restrictions, no alternative cash payout will be offered and your earnings will be refunded to your account. It is your sole responsibility to ensure that you have all the necessary requirements for withdrawal of earnings before joining the Creators Program. All payouts are considered final and are not refundable. 

**§ C8** Upon acceptance into the Creators Program, you are required to furnish us with personal information, including but not limited to your full name, address, country of residence, and tax identification number, if applicable. You represent and warrant to us that the information provided is current, accurate, and complete and agree to keep such information up to date during the course of your membership in the Creators Program. We reserve the right to verify the accuracy of the information against official documents, such as your identification or passport, and you agree to promptly provide us with proof of such information if requested.

**§ C9** In accordance with applicable laws, any applicable tax rate shall be imposed on your payout. You are solely responsible for complying with all tax reporting requirements and for paying the appropriate tax to the relevant governmental entities in accordance with the law. You are required to consult a tax advisor if you are not sure or unsure about your tax responsibilities before you join the Creators Program. Flightsim.to will not be responsible or incur any liability related to taxes on payouts.

**§ C10** Under no circumstances shall we be held accountable for any theft or loss of your earnings, even if your account has been compromised. If you are in violation of these terms or any terms applicable to the Website, or if you are in breach of contract, you will lose access to the Creators Program and all your earnings without compensation. 

**§ C11** The act of manipulating or exploiting the Creators Program system to gain an unfair advantage is strictly prohibited. Flightsim.to retains the right to exclude you from the system temporarily or permanently, or even terminate your account. Any actions taken with the intention of manipulating the system, such as using assets without permission to earn, repeatedly releasing minor updates for mods as separate mod pages to increase earnings, creating fraudulent accounts to boost unique downloads, or any other activities deemed to be an abuse of the system by Flightsim.to staff, will not be tolerated. The staff and moderation team have the discretion to determine if such actions violate the Terms of Service or rules of the Creators Program system.

**§ C12** Please note that participation in the Creators Program system is a privilege and not a right. Flightsim.to reserves the right to modify, discontinue, or terminate the Creators Program at any time, with or without notice. In addition to your indemnification obligations set forth in the Terms of Service, you agree to indemnify, defend and hold Flightsim.to and related parties harmless from any claim, demand, damages, or other losses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, asserted by any third-party resulting from or arising out of any breach by you of these rules. Flightsim.to reserves the right to, with or without notifying you, temporarily or permanently exclude you or your mods from the Creators Program, and/or withhold or erase Earnings you may have already accumulated for acting in violation of these rules. Flightsim.to shall not be liable to you or any third-party for termination of your access to the Creators Program. 

**§ C13** Flightsim.to contributes to the Creators Program at its own discretion and you are not entitled to Earnings or rewards. The ability to earn through the Creators Program is a privilege we provide to you on a voluntary basis, and we do not guarantee the system to remain live for an indefinite amount of time or our contributions to the Creators Program to remain consistent.

**§ C14** In all other respects, the other terms and conditions of these Terms of Use shall apply.

The same applies in the event that this agreement contains an unintentional gap.

**§ 13.1** If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under this Terms of Service, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking of this Terms of Service, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date.
