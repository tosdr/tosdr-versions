Carl-Zeiss-Straße 9  
55129 Mainz

As a rule, we only store your data for as long as is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which the information is collected and processed.

### General information on the legal basis for data processing on this website

If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR or Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a GDPR, if special categories of data are processed according to Art. 9 para. 1 GDPR.

#### **Data processing by social networks**

We maintain publicly accessible profiles on social networks. The individual social networks we use can be found below.

Social networks such as Facebook, Twitter etc. can usually analyze your user behavior comprehensively if you visit their website or a website with integrated social media content (e.g. Like buttons or advertising banners). . Visiting our social media sites triggers numerous data protection-related processing operations. In detail:

If you are logged into your social media account and visit our social media presence, the operator of the social media portal can assign this visit to your user account. However, your personal data may also be recorded if you are not logged in or do not have an account with the respective social media portal. In this case, this data is collected, for example, via cookies that are stored on your end device or by recording your IP address.

With the help of the data collected in this way, the operators of the social media portals can create user profiles in which your preferences and interests are stored. In this way, you can be shown interest-based advertising inside and outside of the respective social media presence. If you have an account with the respective social network, interest-based advertising can be displayed on all devices on which you are logged in or were logged in.

Please also note that we cannot trace all processing operations on the social media portals. Depending on the provider, additional processing operations may therefore be carried out by the operators of the social media portals. Details can be found in the terms of use and data protection regulations of the respective social media portals.

#### **Legal Basis**

Our social media presence is intended to ensure the widest possible presence on the internet. This is a legitimate interest within the meaning of Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The analysis processes initiated by the social networks may be based on different legal bases, which must be specified by the operators of the social networks (e.g. consent within the meaning of Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a GDPR).

#### **Person responsible and assertion of rights**

If you visit one of our social media presences (e.g. Facebook), we are jointly responsible with the operator of the social media platform for the data processing operations triggered during this visit. You can fundamentally exercise your rights (information, correction, deletion, restriction of processing, data portability and complaint) both against. us as well as ggü. the operator of the respective social media portal (e.g. vs. Facebook).

Please note that despite joint responsibility with the social media portal operators, we do not have full influence on the data processing operations of the social media portals. Our options are largely based on the company policy of the respective provider.

#### **Storage period**

The data collected directly by us via the social media presence will be deleted from our systems as soon as you ask us to delete it, revoke your consent to storage or the purpose for data storage not applicable. Saved cookies remain on your end device until you delete them. Mandatory Legal Provisions - esp. retention periods - remain untouched.

We have no influence on the storage period of your data, which is stored by the operators of the social networks for their own purposes. For details, please contact the operators of the social networks directly (e.g. in their data protection declaration, see below).

#### **Your rights**
