3. **Data We Collect and Purpose of Use**

The **first type** of information we collect is aggregated, non-identifiable, non-personal information, which may be made available or gathered via the user’s use of the Service (“**Non-Personal Data**”).

Non-Personal Data may include technical information automatically transmitted by the user’s device such as, type of browser, the type of operating system, access time and date, approximate geographical location, etc.

The **second type** of information is individually identifiable information, namely information that identifies an individual or entity or may with reasonable effort identify an individual (“**Personal Data**”). We do **not** knowingly collect or process any personal data constituting or revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data, data concerning a person’s health, or data concerning a person’s sex life or sexual orientation (“**Sensitive Data**”).
