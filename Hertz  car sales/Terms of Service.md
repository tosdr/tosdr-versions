GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE  
**Last updated April 30, 2013

 We offer this website, subject to the following terms and conditions (“Agreement”). Please read this Agreement carefully before using this website. By using this website, you accept the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. If you do not agree to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, you must not use this website. We may at any time, at our sole discretion, update and revise this Agreement by posting an amended Agreement on this website; any changes that we make to this Agreement will be effective immediately upon posting. Please check this page periodically for changes to the Agreement; you will be able to determine if this Agreement has been changed since your previous visit by viewing the "Last Updated" information that appears at the top of this Agreement. Your use of this website following the posting of any changes constitutes acceptance of those changes.  
   
As used in this Agreement, the terms “we” and “us” mean The Hertz Corporation and the companies in which The Hertz Corporation directly or indirectly owns a majority interest, commonly called “subsidiaries.”  We operate vehicle and construction and industrial equipment rental businesses and, on a more limited scale, retail vehicle sales and claims administration businesses.  Our “licensees” are independent companies in the vehicle and construction and industrial equipment rental businesses, and sometimes in the retail vehicle sales business, that are licensed to operate such businesses using a trade name and trademarks and service marks owned by us, which often incorporate the “Hertz” mark.  Because the licensees are independent of us, they are not our subsidiaries and thus are not included in the terms “we” and “us.”  Our “affiliates” at any time are the companies (other than us) that at the time control us or are under common control with us; the terms “we” and “us” do not include our affiliates.  
   
You must be at least 13 years of age to use this website. If you are not at least 13 years old, you must not access or use this website.

**Claims of Copyright Infringement.** The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the "DMCA") provides recourse for copyright owners who believe that material appearing on the Internet infringes their rights under U.S. copyright law. If you believe in good faith that materials hosted by us infringe your copyright, you (or your agent) may send us a notice requesting that the material be removed, or access to it blocked. The notice must include the following information: (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed (or if multiple copyrighted works located on this website are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works); (c) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or the subject of infringing activity, and information reasonably sufficient to allow us to locate the material on the website; (d) the name, address, telephone number, and email address (if available) of the complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (f) a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. If you believe in good faith that a notice of copyright infringement has been wrongly filed against you, the DMCA permits you to send us a counter-notice. Notices and counter-notices must meet the then-current statutory requirements imposed by the DMCA; see [http://www.copyright.gov](http://www.copyright.gov/) for details. Notices and counter-notices with respect to this website should be sent to Richard McEvily, Senior Vice President and Deputy General Counsel, The Hertz Corporation, 225 Brae Boulevard, Park Ridge, NJ 07656, (201) 307-2000, [dmcanotice@hertz.com](mailto:dmcanotice@hertz.com).
