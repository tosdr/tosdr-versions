Grand jury subpoena for Signal user data, Eastern District of Virginia
======================================================================

04 Oct 2016

In the “first half of 2016” (the most specific we’re permitted to be), we received a subpoena from the Eastern District of Virginia. The subpoena required us to provide information about two Signal users for a federal grand jury investigation.

We’ve designed the Signal service to minimize the data we retain about Signal users, so the only information we can produce in response to a request like this is the date and time a user registered with Signal and the last date of a user’s connectivity to the Signal service.

Notably, things we _don’t_ have stored include anything about a user’s contacts (such as the contacts themselves, a hash of the contacts, any other derivative contact information), anything about a user’s groups (such as how many groups a user is in, which groups a user is in, the membership lists of a user’s groups), or any records of who a user has been communicating with.

All message contents are end-to-end encrypted, so we don’t have that information either.

This is the first subpoena that we’ve received. It originally included a broad gag order that would have prevented us from publishing this notice, but the ACLU represented us in [quickly and successfully securing our ability to publish the transcripts below](https://www.aclu.org/blog/free-future/new-documents-reveal-government-effort-impose-secrecy-encryption-company). We’re committed to treating any future requests the same way: working with effective and talented organizations like the ACLU, and [publishing transcripts of our responses to government requests here](https://signal.org/bigbrother/).

Below is the transcript for this request.
