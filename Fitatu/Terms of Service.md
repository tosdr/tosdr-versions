6. A contract for the provision of a Paid Service concluded for a limited period of time may not be terminated before the end of the period for which it was concluded. The User's submission of a declaration to the above effect shall not result in an obligation to refund payments made by the User.

    2. in the event of a change of Subscription from Fitatu Premium+AI to Fitatu Premium, the new Subscription formula will start after the end of the existing period depending on the subscription plan selected by the User.

16. In the event of a change of the Subscription formula via the Service by the User, Fitatu shall settle the unused funds from the previously used Subscription formula to the new Subscription formula on a pro-rata basis by extending the duration of the newly selected Subscription formula accordingly, immediately charging the entire monetary amount for the new Subscription formula to the User.

5. For the above reasons, Fitatu is not able to guarantee 100% effectiveness of the actions taken by Users, and we also reserve that taking certain actions based on the information provided within the Services may involve a burden on Users' health.

If no information is provided within the period referred to in the preceding sentence, Fitatu shall be deemed to have acknowledged the complaint.
6. Fitatu may refuse to bring the Digital Content or Digital Service into conformity with the Contract if bringing the Digital Content or Digital Service into conformity with the Contract is either impossible or would require unreasonable costs for Fitatu. In assessing the unreasonable cost to Fitatu, all the circumstances of the case shall be taken into account, in particular the significance of the non-compliance of the Digital Content or Digital Service with the Contract and the value of the Digital Content or Digital Service complying with the Contract.
7. Fitatu shall bring the Digital Content or Digital Service into conformity with the Contract within a reasonable time after Fitatu has been informed by the User of the non-conformity with the Contract, and without undue inconvenience to the User, taking into account their nature and the purpose for which they are used.

Fitatu shall make every effort to ensure Users' rights, but cannot directly influence the operation of this method of payment and returns.
11.
