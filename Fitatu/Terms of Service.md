6. A contract for the provision of a Paid Service concluded for a limited period of time may not be terminated before the end of the period for which it was concluded. The User's submission of a declaration to the above effect shall not result in an obligation to refund payments made by the User.

    2. in the event of a change of Subscription from Fitatu Premium+AI to Fitatu Premium, the new Subscription formula will start after the end of the existing period depending on the subscription plan selected by the User.
15.

16. In the event of a change of the Subscription formula via the Service by the User, Fitatu shall settle the unused funds from the previously used Subscription formula to the new Subscription formula on a pro-rata basis by extending the duration of the newly selected Subscription formula accordingly, immediately charging the entire monetary amount for the new Subscription formula to the User.

    4. Even the best-balanced diet may prove ineffective if personal factors (e.g. genetic predisposition, medical conditions) or external factors (e.g. climate, pollution, excessive stress) are present.
5. For the above reasons, Fitatu is not able to guarantee 100% effectiveness of the actions taken by Users, and we also reserve that taking certain actions based on the information provided within the Services may involve a burden on Users' health.

4. If the Services do not comply with the Contract, the User may request that they be brought into conformity with the Contract. The complaint should include: the User's details, information about the Services and the Order, a description and date of the defect in the Services and the User's request.

If no information is provided within the period referred to in the preceding sentence, Fitatu shall be deemed to have acknowledged the complaint.
6. Fitatu may refuse to bring the Digital Content or Digital Service into conformity with the Contract if bringing the Digital Content or Digital Service into conformity with the Contract is either impossible or would require unreasonable costs for Fitatu. In assessing the unreasonable cost to Fitatu, all the circumstances of the case shall be taken into account, in particular the significance of the non-compliance of the Digital Content or Digital Service with the Contract and the value of the Digital Content or Digital Service complying with the Contract.
7. Fitatu shall bring the Digital Content or Digital Service into conformity with the Contract within a reasonable time after Fitatu has been informed by the User of the non-conformity with the Contract, and without undue inconvenience to the User, taking into account their nature and the purpose for which they are used. The costs of bringing the Digital Content or Digital Service into conformity with the Contract shall be borne by Fitatu.

    2. Fitatu has failed to bring the Digital Content or Digital Service into compliance with the Contract,

If the Contract provides that the Digital Content or Digital Service is provided in parts or on a continuous basis, the reduced price must take into account the time during which the Digital Content or Digital Service has remained inconsistent with the Contract.
10. Fitatu shall reimburse the price due as a result of the exercise of the right of withdrawal or price reduction immediately, but no later than within 14 days of receipt of the User's declaration of withdrawal or price reduction. The preceding provision shall not apply to payments through the Application Distributor in the form of Apple, due to the separate return method that operates at this Distributor. Fitatu shall make every effort to ensure Users' rights, but cannot directly influence the operation of this method of payment and returns.
11. The User may not cancel the Contract if the Digital Content or Digital Service is provided in exchange for the payment of a price and the non-conformity of the Digital Content or Digital Service with the Contract is not material.
