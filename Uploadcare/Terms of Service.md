If you operate an account, post content or files to the Services, or otherwise make (or allow any third party to make) any material or information available by means of the Services (any such material, _‚ÄúContent‚Äù_), you are entirely responsible for the content of, and any harm resulting from, that Content. By making Content available, you represent and warrant that:

* You (or any third party on your behalf) shall be using any functionality of the Services for their intended purposes only (e.g. not use the content delivery network Services functionality as CDN origin);

-------------------------------------

* **License to Services**. Subject to your compliance with these Agreement, Uploadcare hereby grants a personal, non-exclusive, non-commercial, non-sublicensable, revocable and non-transferable license to use the Website and Services in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. No rights are granted to you except as expressly set forth in the Agreement.
* **License to Content**. By submitting Content to Uploadcare for inclusion on the Services, you grant Uploadcare a world-wide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, modify, adapt and publish the Content solely for the purpose of displaying, distributing and promoting your account and providing the Services. Uploadcare has the right to grant to its contractors sublicenses under the licenses granted under this section and for the same purpose. If you request for the deletion of your Content, Uploadcare will use reasonable efforts to remove it from the Services, but you acknowledge that caching or references to the Content may not be made immediately unavailable.
* **Feedback**. You grant to Uploadcare worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use and incorporate into the Services and Website any suggestion, enhancement request, recommendation, correction, or other feedback provided by you.
* **Trademarks**. You consent to Uploadcare‚Äôs use of your name and logo and general description of your relationship with Uploadcare in press releases and other marketing materials and appearances. You grant to Uploadcare worldwide, a non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully-paid up license to use and reproduce your trademarks, tradenames and logos in Uploadcare‚Äô marketing materials and website and to indicate that you are an Uploadcare customer. Uploadcare will abide by any written trademark usage guidelines provided by you. All goodwill arising out of the use of your trademarks, tradenames and logos shall inure to your benefit. To decline Uploadcare this license you need to email [help@uploadcare.com](mailto:help@uploadcare.com) stating that you do not wish to be used as a reference.

[4\. Violative Content](#4-violative-content)
---------------------------------------------

Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, Uploadcare has the right (though not the obligation) to, in Uploadcare‚Äôs sole discretion (i) refuse or remove any content that, in Uploadcare‚Äôs reasonable opinion, violates any Uploadcare policy or is in any way harmful or objectionable, or (ii) terminate or deny access to and use of the Services to any individual or entity for any reason. Uploadcare will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid.

[5\. Paid Services](#5-paid-services)
-------------------------------------

* **Fees; Payment**. You can sign up for paid Services provided by us (_‚ÄúPaid Services‚Äù_). By signing up for a Paid Services account you agree to pay Uploadcare the monthly fees. There are two types of monthly fees: _‚ÄúSubscription Fees‚Äù_ and _‚ÄúUsage Fees‚Äù_ indicated at [https://uploadcare.com/pricing/](https://uploadcare.com/pricing/) or as indicated in your Order Form. By signing up for a Paid Services account you agree to pay Uploadcare both monthly Subscription Fees and Usage Fees.
* **Subscription Fees** are based on the selected subscription type and cover the certain number of units. Subscription Fees are charged in advance on the day you sign up for the Paid Services and will cover the use of Paid Services for a monthly or annual period as indicated.
* **Usage Fees** are charged when you exceed the number of units included in your subscription plan. Payments related to Usage Fees will be charged at the end of each month in which there has been an excess and are based on the tariffs applied to your subscription type.
* **Refund, Change and Cancellation of Services**. Paid Services fees are not refundable. Uploadcare reserves the right to change the payment terms and fees upon thirty days prior written notice to you. Paid Services may be canceled by you at any time through your account settings page, subject to the terms of this Agreement.
* **Discount**. Uploadcare may offer you, at its sole discretion, Paid Services at a discounted rate (the _‚ÄúDiscounted Services‚Äù_) if you commit to subscribe to the Services for an annual or longer subscription period (the _‚ÄúDiscount Subscription Period‚Äù_) or as indicated in your Order Form. Payments will be charged in advance on the day you sign up for a Discounted Service and will cover the use of that service for a monthly or annual subscription period as indicated.
* **Invoice**. Applicable fees for Paid Services or Discounted Services, as the case may be, will be invoiced on the day you sign up for a Service and shall be due in advance of using such Services as provided in the Order Form. If any invoiced amount based on any combination of Subscription Fees and Usage Fees is not received by Uploadcare by the due date, then without limiting Uploadcare‚Äôs rights or remedies: (a) Uploadcare may suspend your access to the Website and/or Services until the invoiced amount will be received through your credit card or other payment mechanism; (b) those charges may accrue late interest at the rate of 1.5% of the outstanding balance per month, or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower; (c) Uploadcare may condition future subscription renewals on shorter payment terms; and (d) Uploadcare may accelerate your unpaid fee obligations to become immediately due and payable, and suspend the provision of Services to you until the overdue amounts are paid in full.
* **Automatic Renewal**. Unless you notify Uploadcare before the end of the applicable subscription period that you want to cancel a Paid Service or Discounted Service, your subscription will automatically renew and you authorize Uploadcare, or a third party through which you transact (without notice to you, unless required by applicable law) to collect the then-applicable annual or monthly subscription fee for such Service (as well as any taxes) using any credit card or other payment mechanism we have on record for you. If all credit cards we have on file for you or any other payment method used by you are declined for payment of your membership or subscription fees, Uploadcare may suspend or cancel the provision of Services to you, as applicable, unless you provide us with a new credit card or another payment mechanism. If you provide us with a new credit card and are successfully charged before your subscription is cancelled, your new subscription period will be based on the original renewal date and not the date of the successful charge.
* **Support**. Certain Paid Services packages include access to priority email and telephone support. ‚ÄúEmail support‚Äù means the ability to make requests for technical support assistance by email at any time (with reasonable efforts by Uploadcare to respond within one business day) concerning the use of the Paid Services. ‚ÄúPriority‚Äù means that support for Paid Services customers takes priority over support for users of the standard, free Uploadcare Services. All Paid Services support will be provided in accordance with Uploadcare standard Paid Services practices, procedures and policies.
* **Order Form**. In addition to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the provision of Paid Services and Discounted Services and your obligations relating to the same will be subjected to the terms and conditions of any applicable order form provided by Uploadcare to you (the _‚ÄúOrder Form‚Äù_). In terms of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and the Order Form, the provisions of this Agreement shall prevail except where the Order Form expressly provides that it shall prevail over a provision of the Agreement.
* **Taxes**. All fees for Services and any Upgrades (as defined below) are exclusive of taxes, levies, duties or charges imposed by government authorities (collectively, _‚ÄúTaxes‚Äù_). You shall be solely responsible for all sales, service, value-added, use, excise, consumption and any other Taxes on amounts payable by Customer under the Order Forms and this Agreement (other than any Taxes on Uploadcare‚Äôs income, revenues, gross receipts, personnel or assets). Without limiting the foregoing, if you are required to deduct or withhold any Taxes under applicable laws outside the United States, you shall remit such Taxes in accordance with those applicable laws and all fees payable shall be increased so that Uploadcare receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no withholding or deduction been made. If an applicable tax authority requires Uploadcare to pay any taxes that should have been payable by you, Uploadcare will advise you in writing, and you will promptly reimburse Uploadcare for the amounts paid.

[6\. Upgrades](#6-upgrades)
---------------------------

* **General Terms**. Optional Paid Services (including _‚ÄúService Upgrades‚Äù_ and _‚ÄúUsage Upgrades‚Äù_, collectively, _‚ÄúUpgrades‚Äù_) are available through the use of the Services. By selecting an Upgrade you agree to pay Uploadcare the monthly or annual subscription fees indicated for that service. Payments will be charged on a pre-pay basis on the day you sign up for an Upgrade and will cover the use of that service for a monthly or annual subscription period as indicated. Upgrade fees are not refundable.
* **Automatic Renewal**. Unless you notify Uploadcare before the end of the applicable subscription period that you want to cancel an Upgrade, your Upgrade subscription will automatically renew and you authorize us to collect the then-applicable annual or monthly subscription fee for such Upgrade (as well as any taxes) using any credit card or other payment mechanism we have on record for you. Upgrades can be canceled at any time by notifying Uploadcare through the means of the Services dashboard.

[7\. Responsibility of Services Users and Contributors](#7-responsibility-of-services-users-and-contributors)

Uploadcare has not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material, including computer software, posted to the Services, and cannot therefore be responsible for that material‚Äôs content, use or effects. By operating the Services, Uploadcare does not represent or imply that it endorses the material there posted, or that it believes such material to be accurate, useful or non- harmful. You are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content. The Services may contain content that is offensive, indecent, or otherwise objectionable, as well as content containing technical inaccuracies, typographical mistakes, and other errors.

[8\. Content Posted on Other Resources](#8-content-posted-on-other-resources)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material, including computer software, made available through the websites, webpages, computer software, applications, libraries, APIs or services (collectively, _‚ÄúResources‚Äù_) to which we link, and that link to us. Uploadcare does not have any control over those non-Uploadcare Resources, and is not responsible for their contents or their use. By linking to a non-Uploadcare Resource, Uploadcare does not represent or imply that it endorses such Resource. You are responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems from viruses, worms, trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive content present on non-Uploadcare Resource. Uploadcare disclaims any responsibility and you acknowledge and agree that Uploadcare shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such non-Uploadcare Resource.

[9\. General Representation and Warranty](#9-general-representation-and-warranty)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You represent and warrant that (i) your use of the Services will be in strict accordance with the Uploadcare's [Privacy Policy](https://uploadcare.com/about/privacy-policy/), with this Agreement and with all applicable laws and regulations (including without limitation any local laws or regulations in your country, state, city, or other governmental area, regarding online conduct and acceptable content, and including all applicable laws regarding the transmission of technical data exported from the United States or the country in which you reside) and (ii) your use of the Services will not infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of any third party.

[10\. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#10-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As Uploadcare asks others to respect its intellectual property rights, it respects the intellectual property rights of others. Please notify us if you believe that material located on or linked to by Uploadcare violates your copyright or if you are aware of any intellectual property right infringement by a user of our Services. In compliance with Section 512 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the ‚ÄúDMCA‚Äù), we designate the following individual to receive any notifications of an alleged infringement:

**Copyright Agent**

Uploadcare, Inc Attn: Uploadcare Designated Agent 18401 Collins Ave, Ste. 100-241, Sunny Isles Beach, FL, 33160 United States of America. [dmca@uploadcare.com](mailto:dmca@uploadcare.com)

An effective notification should include:

* A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;
* Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site;
* Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material;
* Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining party may be contacted;
* A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;
* A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

A notification that does not comply with all the above-mentioned requirements may not be valid. If you believe that a notice was wrongly filed against you, under the DMCA, you may file a counter-notice to our designated individual with the following information:

* Your physical or electronic signature;
* Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled;
* A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled;
* Your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which we are located, or if your address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which we may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification or an agent of such person.

All limitations of access, suspensions, and terminations for cause shall be made in Uploadcare‚Äôs sole discretion and Uploadcare shall not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your or any third party‚Äôs account or access to the Services.

It is often difficult to determine if your intellectual property rights have been violated or if the DMCA requirements have been met. You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with all of the requirements of this Section, your DMCA notice may not be valid. We may request additional information before we remove any infringing material. If a dispute develops as to the correct owner of the rights in question, we reserve the right to remove your content along with that of the alleged infringer pending resolution of the matter. Uploadcare will provide you with notice if your materials have been removed based on a third-party complaint of alleged infringement of the third-party‚Äôs intellectual property rights. We have a policy of terminating accounts of users who repeatedly and intentionally infringe the intellectual property rights of others.

IF YOU KNOWINGLY MISREPRESENT THAT MATERIAL IS OR IS NOT INFRINGING, YOU MAY BE SUBJECT TO CIVIL PENALTIES. THESE INCLUDE MONETARY DAMAGES, COURT COSTS, AND ATTORNEYS' FEES INCURRED BY UPLOADCARE, BY ANY COPYRIGHT OWNER, OR BY ANY COPYRIGHT OWNER'S LICENSEE THAT IS INJURED AS A RESULT OF RELIANCE UPON YOUR MISREPRESENTATION. YOU MAY ALSO BE SUBJECT TO CRIMINAL PROSECUTION FOR PERJURY. You agree we may provide your notice to the provider of the allegedly infringing material. The obligations under this section shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement or your use of the Services.

[11\. Intellectual Property Ownership](#11-intellectual-property-ownership)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This Agreement does not transfer from Uploadcare to you any Uploadcare or third party intellectual property, and all right, title and interest in and to such property, including but not limited to the Services, will remain (as between the parties) solely with Uploadcare. Uploadcare, Uploadcare Inc., Uploadcare.com, the Uploadcare logo, and all other trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos used in connection with Uploadcare, or the Services are trademarks or registered trademarks of Uploadcare or Uploadcare‚Äôs licensors. Other trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos used in connection with the Services may be the trademarks of other third parties. Your use of the Services grants you no right or license to reproduce or otherwise use any Uploadcare or third-party trademarks. No rights are granted to you except as expressly set forth in the Agreement.

[13\. Mailing List](#13-mailing-list)
-------------------------------------

You can unsubscribe from our mailing list at any time directly from the unsubscribe link included in each electronic marketing message we send to you. If you do so, we will promptly update our databases, and will take all reasonable steps to meet your request at the earliest possible opportunity, but we may continue to contact you to the extent necessary for the purposes of providing our Services.

When providing Uploadcare with your personal information, the processing of your personal information is governed by the Uploadcare's [Privacy Policy](https://uploadcare.com/about/privacy-policy/). Uploadcare reserves the right to contact you personally for the means of improving the Services.

[14\. Changes](#14-changes)

It is your responsibility to check this [https://uploadcare.com/about/terms/](https://uploadcare.com/about/terms/) periodically for changes. Your continued use of or access to the Website or Services following the posting of any changes to this Agreement constitutes acceptance of those changes. Uploadcare may also, in the future, offer new services and/or features through the Website (including, the release of new tools and resources). Such new features and/or services shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

[15\. Termination](#15-termination)
-----------------------------------

* **Termination Rights for Services ‚Äî Excluding Paid or Discounted Services or Upgrades**. Uploadcare may terminate your access to all or any part of the Services, at any time, at its own discretion, with or without notice, effective immediately. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, if you wish to terminate this Agreement or your Uploadcare account (if you have one), you may simply discontinue using the Services.
* **Termination for Cause ‚Äî Paid or Discounted Services or Upgrades**. In addition to Uploadcare‚Äôs right to terminate this Agreement under the Agreement, you or Uploadcare may terminate the Agreement for cause (a) upon 30 days‚Äô written notice to the other of a material breach if the breach remains uncured at the expiration of the notice period or (b) if the other party (i) becomes the subject of a proceeding relating to insolvency, receivership, liquidation or assignment for the benefit of creditors to the extent permitted by applicable laws or governmental regulations, (ii) goes out of business or (iii) ceases its operations; provided that, Uploadcare may terminate the Services immediately as part of a general shut down of our service.
* **Cancellation of Discounted Services**. Except in the event of termination for cause as in section 15(b) above, Discounted Services are (a) non-cancellable; and (b) cannot be decreased for the first six (6) months of the Discount Subscription Period. In the event that you choose to cancel or decrease the Discounted service after six months but before the end of the Discount Subscription Period, you shall pay Uploadcare cancellation charges equal to the discount granted you by Uploadcare for committing to a Discount Subscription Period. You authorize us to collect the applicable cancellation charges (as well as any taxes) using any credit card or other payment mechanism we have on record for you. Cancellation of Discounted Services may be effected through your account settings page and is subject to the terms of this Agreement. All fees paid for commitments to a Discount Subscription Period are not refundable.
* **Effect of Termination**. Upon termination of this Agreement, your rights under these Agreement will automatically terminate. Accordingly, upon termination, your right to use the Services will immediately cease and you will lose all data related to your account. All fees that were due prior to the termination of the Agreement and Services shall remain due and become immediately payable. In such an event, you must cease all use of the Services. Our failure to insist upon or enforce your strict compliance with these Agreement will not constitute a waiver of any of our rights. All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, confidentiality, payment obligations and limitations of liability.

[16\. Confidentiality](#16-confidentiality)
-------------------------------------------

* **Confidential Information**. ‚ÄúConfidential Information‚Äù means all information disclosed by a party (_‚ÄúDisclosing Party‚Äù_) to the other party (_‚ÄúReceiving Party‚Äù_), whether orally or in writing, that is designated as confidential or, given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure, should be understood to be confidential. Your Confidential Information includes the Content; Uploadcare‚Äôs Confidential Information includes the Services and any documentation related thereto; and Confidential Information of each party includes but is not limited to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and all Order Forms, including pricing, business and marketing plans, technology and technical information, product plans and designs, and business processes disclosed by each party in connection with this Agreement.

Except as provided in Section 16(c) below, the Receiving Party shall not disclose or otherwise make available any Confidential Information of Disclosing Party to anyone except those of its employees, directors, attorneys, agents and consultants who: (a) need to know the Confidential Information in connection with the purpose of the Agreement and (b) who have previously agreed to be bound by confidentiality obligations no less stringent than those in the Agreement. Each party shall (x) safeguard all Confidential Information of the other party with at least the same degree of care (but no less than reasonable care) as it uses to safeguard its own confidential information and (y) not use any Confidential Information of the other party for any purpose outside the scope of the Agreement. In the event of any breach or threatened breach by the Receiving Party of its obligations under this Section 16, the Disclosing Party will be entitled to seek injunctive and other equitable relief to enforce such obligations.
* **Disclosure**. If Receiving Party is compelled by law to disclose Confidential Information of Disclosing Party, then to the extent legally permitted, Receiving Party shall provide Disclosing Party with prior notice of the compelled disclosure and reasonable assistance, at Disclosing Party‚Äôs cost, if Disclosing Party wishes to contest the compelled disclosure. Any compelled disclosure shall be limited to the extent required, and shall be subject to confidentiality protections to the extent practicable. If Receiving Party is compelled by law to disclose Disclosing Party‚Äôs Confidential Information as part of a civil proceeding to which Disclosing Party is a party, and Disclosing Party is not contesting the disclosure, Disclosing Party will reimburse Receiving Party for its reasonable cost of compiling and providing secure access to that Confidential Information.
