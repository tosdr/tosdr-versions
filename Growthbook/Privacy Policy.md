GrowthBook, LLC and its subsidiaries and affiliates (“Growth Book”, “we”, or “us”) knows that you value your privacy. This privacy policy explains the information we collect through the websites available via growthbook.io and its subdomains as well as through other GrowthBook-managed websites or pages where this privacy policy is posted or linked (collectively, the “Sites”). This policy also describes the information collected from or on behalf of end users of our software-as-a-service products (the “GrowthBook Services”).  
  
This policy describes how the above information is collected, used, shared, and secured, as well as your related choices regarding use, access and correction. This policy does not apply to the information GrowthBook receives from the third-party websites, mobile apps and other digital products that use the GrowthBook Services. When our customers use the GrowthBook Service on their own websites and products, they remain responsible for their own privacy and security practices, which may differ from ours. You should consult the relevant privacy policies on our customers' websites and products to find out more about their privacy practices and your related choices. For more information, please consult Data Subject Rights - Third Party End Users.

-----------------------------------

We do not share your personal information outside of GrowthBook except in certain circumstances, including:  

When you allow us to share the information, such as when you:  

* When our service providers are providing services on our behalf. For example, we may use an outside platform to host portions of our Sites or to provide certain features on the GrowthBook Service, or we may use a credit card processing company to bill you for services you purchase. Unless otherwise expressly noted, when acting as GrowthBook’s agents, these services providers are prohibited from using the personal information we have shared with them for purposes other than those requested by us or required by law;
    
* To enforce our terms, agreements, policies or rules, to help protect the security, integrity and availability of our or another party's products, systems and services; to exercise or protect the rights, property (including intellectual property), or safety of GrowthBook, our users, or others; to comply with legal requirements; or in other cases if we believe in good faith that disclosure is required by law (including in response to a lawful subpoena or other law enforcement request); and
    
* In connection with a sale, divesture, or transfer of our company (including any shares in the company) or any combination of its products, services, assets, affiliates, and/or businesses. Your personal information (such as customer names and email addresses, and user information related to the GrowthBook Service) may be among the items sold or otherwise acquired in these types of transactions. We may also sell, assign or otherwise transfer such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, dissolutions, reorganizations, liquidations, similar transactions or proceedings involving all or a portion of the company. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.
    

We may also share aggregated information (such as usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) for other business purposes. For instance, we may share aggregate reports with interested third parties to help them understand the usage patterns for certain GrowthBook Services or for our Sites or those of our partners.

6\. Children’s Privacy
----------------------

Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, GrowthBook does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete the information we have stored as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us as indicated in the "Contact Us" section below.

7\. Storage and Processing
--------------------------

Your information may be stored and processed in – and we may transfer information to – the U.S. and other countries where GrowthBook (including its subsidiaries and affiliates) and our advertising partners and service providers maintain systems and facilities. In addition, information that we collect about you (including personal information) may be transferred to our affiliated entities and/or to other third parties across borders and/or from your country to other countries around the world.  
  
You acknowledge that we may transfer information to the U.S., to any country in which GrowthBook, its advertising partners, and its service providers maintain systems or facilities, and to other countries globally.  
  
If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, you acknowledge that we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction, consistent with our legal obligations governing the transfer of such data.

8\. Data Security and Integrity
-------------------------------

GrowthBook is concerned about the security of your data. We have implemented technical and organizational security measures that are designed to help protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, use and modification. From time-to-time, we review our security procedures to consider appropriate new technologies and methods.  
  
Please be aware, though, that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot ensure, and do not warrant or guarantee, that the information you transmit to Growth Book will remain secure, nor do we guarantee that this information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered, destroyed or used in an unauthorized manner.  
  
If we learn of a security breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We may also post a notice on the Site or GrowthBook Services if a security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive a notice of a security breach in writing. If you have any questions about the security of your personal information, please contact us as indicated in the ‘Contact Us’ section below.

9\. Data Retention
------------------

How long we keep the personal information we collect depends on the type of information, the purpose for which it is used, how sensitive it is, and similar factors. In general, we will retain your personal information for the length of time reasonably needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy (including for as long as need to provide you or our customer with products and services), unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. We will also retain and use your information for as long as necessary to resolve disputes and/or enforce our rights and agreements.

Aggregated information may be stored indefinitely.

If an individual in the EEA has consented to our use of their personal information, and our processing is based on that consent, that individual has the right to withdraw their consent in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place. If you object to or restrict processing, you may not be able to use the Sites and GrowthBook Services or certain features any longer.  
  
Where we are using your information because we or a third party (e.g. your employer) have a legitimate interest to do so, individuals in the EEA have the right to object to that use as specified in Article 21 of the GDPR, though, in some cases, this may mean no longer using the Sites or GrowthBook Service. Growth Book further acknowledges that EEA data subjects have certain other rights under the GDPR, including the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority and to request from the controller access to, and rectification or erasure of, personal data, restriction of processing concerning the data subject, and data portability (in each case, as specified under the GDPR).  
  
Where GrowthBook is acting as a controller, you can initiate a by contacting us as specified in the “Contacting Us” section below. Please note that these requests apply only to information that GrowthBook holds as a “controller.” If your request relates to the personal data collected through a customer’s websites or digital products, you should direct your request to the owner of that website or product. Please note that you must verify your identity and request before GrowthBook will process your request. You may be required to provide email confirmation or other information in order for us to verify your identity.

California Resident Notices

Effective January 1, 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”) allows consumers who are California residents, upon a verifiable consumer request, to request from a business:  

* Delete any personal information about the consumer which the business has collected from the consumer;
    
* Disclose to the consumer certain information about the personal information that the business collects from the consumer; and
    
* Direct a business that sells personal information about the consumer to third parties not to sell the consumer’s personal information
    

GrowthBook does not sell any consumer personal information to third parties. To submit an data access or data deletion request, please visit our portal or contact us at privacy@growthbook.io.

As a general policy, GrowthBook does not share personal information with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes without your prior consent. Accordingly, you can prevent disclosure of your personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes by withholding consent. Please contact us at privacy@growthbook.io if you would like to make such a request.

12\. Do Not Track and Cross-Site Tracking
-----------------------------------------

Do Not Track is a privacy preference that users can set in their web browsers. When a user turns on the Do Not Track signal, the browser sends a message to websites requesting them not to track the user. For information about Do Not Track, visit www.allaboutdnt.org. At this time, we do not respond to Do Not Track browser settings or signals. In addition, some of our advertising partners, and other third-party services and tools on our Site and/or the GrowthBook Service, may use standard technologies, such as cookies, pixel tags, and web beacons, to collect information about your internet activities across websites. You may be able to disable certain third-party cross-site tracking as described in the "Your Choices" section above.
