Introduction. Welcome to Lookout and thank you for your interest in our products and services! This Agreement (which

includes the Acceptable Use Policy and any applicable Guidelines, as defined below) governs your use of or access to any

Lookout Service, so please review it carefully. You should also review our Privacy Policy which provides additional

information about our collection, use and disclosure of User Data which you provide us directly and that which is collected

from your use of the Lookout Service. The Lookout Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”), as may be updated by Lookout

from time to time in accordance with its terms, is hereby incorporated into this Agreement, and you hereby agree to the

collection, use and disclose practices set forth therein. “Lookout Service” means any product, app, software, add-on,

extension, website, online service, license code, feature, functionality, content or service that is owned, controlled or

provided by Lookout, including our mobile apps (such as the Lookout Mobile Security app) (“Apps”), Identity Protection

Services, Documentation, support services and Premium Subscriptions to which may use or subscribe. Lookout Services

may be distributed to you directly by Lookout or through a Lookout-authorized mobile carrier partner, app store partner,

reseller, distributor or other channel partner (each, a “Distributor”). In either case, this Agreement governs your use of or

access to the Lookout Services. All references in this Agreement to “you” or “your,” as applicable, mean the user of the

Lookout Services, and each of your heirs, successors and assigns.

1. Your Account. You may need to create a Lookout account (“Account”) to place orders for or use certain Lookout

Services (or some of their features). You understand that we may send notices, e-mails, statements, announcements and

other account-related information to you using the information on your Account, and you hereby consent to us doing so.

You represent and warrant that your Account information is accurate and complete, and you agree to keep your Account

information (including any payment information) up-to-date, accurate and complete. You are responsible for the security of

your Account, including for keeping any access credentials (such as user IDs, passwords and other access credentials)

secure. You must not share your access credentials with any other person or entity and, in case of any security breach, you

must promptly notify Lookout and change your access credentials immediately. You are solely responsible for all activities

that occur on or through your Account, including any purchases. In no event will any Lookout Entity (as defined below) be

responsible for any activity, damages, liability or losses arising out of or resulting from the unauthorized use of your Account

or from your failure to keep your Account information and access credentials secure, accurate and complete.

2. Use Rights.

2.1. Your Use Rights. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Lookout grants you a personal, non-

transferable, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, limited, revocable license, without the right to sublicense, to use the Lookout

Service(s) that Lookout makes accessible to you (either itself or through a Distributor), provided you use the Lookout Service

solely for your personal, non-commercial use and strictly in accordance with this Agreement and any applicable Guidelines,

Documentation and Usage Limits (as defined below). You may use the Apps only on those mobile devices that you legally

own and control, and you understand and agree that Lookout may impose Usage Limits on your use as described below. If

you are using an App on an Apple, Inc. (“Apple”) iOS device, the foregoing license is further limited to use permitted by the

Usage Rules set forth in Apple’s App Store Terms of Service. Mobile Services. Use of the Apps requires usage of data

services provided by your wireless service carrier. You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for data

usage fees and any other fees that your wireless service carrier may charge in connection with your use of the Apps.

2.2. Premium Subscription. Lookout may make certain Lookout Services (such as our Apps or premium features)

available to you for a fee (each such Lookout Service, a “Premium Subscription”). These Premium Subscription(s) are

provided to you for a monthly, annual or other subscription term specified at the time you place your order (the “Subscription

Term”). With respect to Premium Subscriptions, the rights granted to you above: (i) are subject to our receipt of payment of

and/or change its support services (including by modifying support hours and communication channels) at any time without

liability to you. To the extent permitted by applicable law all Documentation and support services are provided “AS IS”

without warranty of any kind. Lookout does not guarantee that errors will be resolved, that our Documentation or responses

will be accurate or that responses will be timely. If you have obtained any Lookout Services from one of Lookout’s

Distributors, that Distributor has no responsibility to provide you with any warranty, maintenance or support services with

respect to the Lookout Services or for otherwise addressing any issue or claim with Lookout Services.

2.4. Usage Limits. You understand and agree that, from time to time and without liability to you, Lookout may establish

of devices that can be associated with an Account, the number of devices where our Apps can be installed, and storage

any bugfixes, patches, maintenance releases, upgrades and updates to Lookout Services that Lookout develops and makes

understand and agree that Lookout has no obligation to provide you with Updates and that any Updates may be made

available for a fee or under different or additional terms and conditions, as determined by Lookout. Lookout Services

consisting of installable software (such as our Apps) may update automatically on your device once a new version or feature

is available, and you consent to such automatic Updates. We are constantly changing and improving our Lookout Services,

to suspend or stop a Lookout Service altogether.

your authorized use; (x) access or use a Lookout Service in a way that avoids incurring applicable fees or hiding usage; (xi)

of Lookout’s intellectual property and other proprietary rights.

free license to Use User Content in order to provide (including to you), operate, promote, and improve Lookout Services, to

develop new ones and as otherwise stated in this Agreement and the Privacy Policy. This license also includes any

Lookout in the future, as well as any related code, content and materials that you provide to us.

3.2. User Data. When you use Lookout Services, Lookout may collect or receive data, information and code from you

and/or the devices where you use the Lookout Services (the “User Data”). Our Privacy Policy, together with this Agreement,

describes our collection and Use of User Data. To the greatest extent permitted under the laws of your jurisdiction, you

hereby consent to the collection and Use of User Data as described in our Privacy Policy and this Agreement.

use of Lookout Services. We do not endorse User Content or User Data, have no obligation to monitor any User Content

or User Data, and assume no responsibility whatsoever for these materials. In all cases, Lookout reserves the right to

to third parties. Lookout may take these actions without prior notification to you or any third party. Removal or disabling of

access to these materials shall be at our sole discretion and to the extent permissible in the jurisdiction where the Lookout

Services are provided, we do not promise to remove or disable access to any specific User Content or User Data. You are

solely responsible for maintaining additional backup of User Content and any User Data, and Lookout is not responsible for

loss or destruction of these materials.

accordance with our DMCA Policy below.

represent and warrant that: (i) you are either more than 18 years of age, or an emancipated minor, or possess legal parental

or guardian consent and (ii) are fully able and competent, and have the legal power, capacity and authority, to enter into

features designed to help monitor and protect your identity (“Identity Protection Services”). You may use the Identity

Protection Services only if you are a United States resident and solely for your own personal benefit to protect against or

prevent actual fraud, unauthorized transactions, claims or other liabilities. Our Privacy Policy further describes the types of

User Data collected by the Identity Protection Services. You understand and agree that by accepting this Agreement you

are providing “written instructions” to Lookout and its service providers to exchange User Data about you with our service

providers and their data suppliers and to provide you with the Identity Protection Services. You agree and hereby authorize

Lookout and its service providers to provide User Data (or, if applicable, information about others you have enrolled) to third

parties in order to provide the Identity Protection Services and as otherwise described in our Privacy Policy. You further

authorize Lookout and its service providers to provide you with monitoring and alerts and to obtain various information and

reports about you (or about others that you have enrolled) in order to provide the Identity Protection Services, including

address history, name, alias and other reports. The preceding authorizations also extend to our service providers’

employees, agents, parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, contractors, and data suppliers. The Identity Protection Services may

include insurance coverage provided by a third-party. That coverage is subject to the terms, conditions and exclusions of

the Identity Fraud Reimbursement Policy, which may be updated from time to time. The Lookout Entities (as defined below)

are not licensed insurers or insurance agents, and they will not be liable for claims, coverage or liability under the Identity

Fraud Reimbursement Policy.

software, add-ons, extensions, websites, online services, features, functionality and/or content that is owned or controlled

by third parties (such items, the “Third Party Products”). Third Party Products may be governed by terms of service, privacy

policies, and other agreements between you and the provider of such products, and you agree to review and abide by such

terms and policies. You acknowledge and agree that Lookout is not responsible and shall have no liability for the content

of such Third Party Products or services made available through them, or your use of or interaction with them.

Terms of Service (Mar. 1, 2023)



4.5. Other Service-Specific Terms. Our Lookout Services are very diverse, so sometimes we may post or provide

additional terms, conditions and guidelines (collectively, the “Guidelines”) applicable to a particular Lookout Service (or

particular features). If you access or use such Lookout Services, those Guidelines become part of and are incorporated by

reference into this Agreement.

5. Payments Terms.

5.1. Fees. If you place an order for a Premium Subscription, you agree to pay the applicable fees upfront for the entire

Subscription Term. All fees and charges are nonrefundable and non-creditable, and there are no refunds or credits for

partially used Subscription Terms.

5.2. Billing Methods. If you order Premium Subscription from Lookout using your credit card, we will automatically charge

the applicable fees plus any applicable taxes to your credit card for the entire Subscription Term. If your credit card reaches

its expiration date, your continued use of the Premium Subscription constitutes your authorization for us to continue billing

that credit card and you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. If you order any Lookout Services from a

Distributor (such as from your wireless operator using carrier billing, by purchasing our App(s) using app-store billing or by

purchasing a license key from a Distributor), you may make applicable payments to the Distributor subject to the terms and

conditions between you and that Distributor, but your use of Lookout Services remains subject to this Agreement.

5.3. Trials. From time to time, we may offer trials of Premium Subscriptions for a specified period without payment or at

a reduced rate (a “Trial”). Lookout reserves the right, in its discretion, to determine your eligibility for a Trial, and, subject to

applicable laws, to withdraw or to modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the greatest extent

permitted under the law. We may automatically start to charge you for the applicable Premium Subscription on the first day

following the end of the Trial, unless you cancel as described in the “Automatic Renewals” section below.

5.4. Failure to Pay. If you fail to timely pay any fees, if we are unable to process your payment, or if we do not receive

our corresponding payment from the Distributor from whom you purchased the Premium Subscription, Lookout at its option

may suspend or terminate your right to use the Premium Subscription, without liability to you. Regardless of such termination

or suspension, you will be responsible for paying all past due amounts.

5.5. Automatic Renewals. To the extent not prohibited by applicable law and unless otherwise specified by us at

the time you place your order Lookout Premium Subscriptions are provided on a subscription basis for the

monthly, annual or other subscription term you selected. You understand and agree that your subscription is auto-

recurring and will automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off (as described below) at least twenty-four

hours before the end of the current subscription term. FOR CLARITY, FOR ANY PAID SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE

ACCOUNT TYPE, YOU WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY ENROLLED IN (AND CHARGED FOR) THE LOOKOUT PREMIUM

SUBSCRIPTION PLAN YOU SELECTED FOLLOWING THE END OF ANY APPLICABLE FREE TRIAL PERIOD. YOU

MUST CANCEL PRIOR TO THE END OF YOUR FREE TRIAL IN THE MANNER SPECIFIED ABOVE TO AVOID BEING

CHARGED. Please note that we reserve the right to change the cost of your subscription effective on automatic

renewal of your subscription, and we will notify you of any changes to the cost of your subscription before your

subscription renews. When your subscription renews, your account will automatically be charged the then-

applicable subscription price, and you hereby authorize us to charge the payment method on your account.

Subscriptions may be managed, and auto-renewal may be turned off, by going to the Account Settings screen on

your device (or through the account page on the applicable App Store) after your purchase. You may cancel your

subscription during a subscription term, however there will be no refunds or credits for partial subscription terms.

You agree to receive all communications electronically.

6. Termination and Suspension.

6.1. Termination and Suspension. You may terminate this Agreement at any time, for any reason or for no reason, by

deleting your Lookout Services account by logging in to your account at https://personal.lookout.com/#/settings and

selecting “Delete account.” Note that deleting any Apps from your device will not terminate your Lookout Services account.

We may terminate or suspend your Account and/or your access to the Lookout Services, without prior notice and without

liability, for any or no reason, including if we determine in good faith that: (a) you have violated this Agreement, (b) you have

infringed third party rights or any applicable laws, rules or regulations, (c) you are no longer actively using the Lookout

Service, or (d) you have failed to pay fees owed to Lookout. These remedies are in addition to any other remedies Lookout

may have at law, in equity or otherwise. We will make a reasonable attempt to notify you of any termination or suspension

of your access to the Lookout Services using the information on your Account or through the Lookout Service itself. However,

we reserve the right to terminate access to Lookout Services at any time, with or without notice.

6.2. Effect of Termination. You acknowledge and agree that upon suspension, termination or expiration your ability to

access User Content and/or User Data will cease and that Lookout will have no obligation to store any such items or provide

them to you. If we terminate your access to Lookout Service(s), your license rights shall terminate and you must: (i)

immediately cease any use the applicable Lookout Service(s) and (ii) delete (or, at our request, return) any and all copies

you have of the applicable Lookout Service (if any).

6.3. Survival. All terms and conditions of this Agreement will survive any suspension, termination or expiration, except

for the rights granted to you under Section 3.1 (Your Use Rights).

7. Intellectual Property Rights.

7.1. Lookout Technology. Notwithstanding any use of the words “purchase”, “sale” or similar terms, the Lookout Services

are being licensed to you, not sold. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Lookout (or the Lookout Entities, as

applicable) retain all rights, title and interest (including all intellectual property rights) in and to the Lookout Services, any

content, data, results, information, analysis or output generated by or that you obtain from a Lookout Service, and any

Updates, modifications or derivative works of any of the foregoing, including as may incorporate any Feedback. Lookout

reserves any licenses not expressly granted herein.

7.2. Open Source. Sometimes Lookout may provide you with software, such as Apps, that may include components

subject to a so-called “open source” software license (such components, “Open-Source Components”). To the extent

required by the license terms covering the Open-Source Components, those license terms will apply in lieu of the license

terms and restrictions of Section 3; however, the remaining sections of this Agreement, including Section 9 (Disclaimers

and Limitations of Liability), will continue to apply to all components of the Lookout Services, including Open-Source

Components.

8. Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability.

Please read the following provisions carefully, as they limit the liability of Lookout Entities. “Lookout Entities” means: (i)

Lookout, its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates and related companies (collectively, the “Lookout Companies”); (ii) the Lookout

Companies’ officers, directors, employees, agents, contractors and representatives; and (iii) the Lookout Companies’

Distributors, licensors, suppliers, service providers and data providers (including without limitation our providers of hosted

KIND, AND EACH LOOKOUT ENTITY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES (WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED,

STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE), INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE,

FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, THE

LOOKOUT ENTITIES (AND EACH OF THEM) DO NOT REPRESENT, WARRANT OR GUARANTEE THAT ANY

WHOLE OR IN PART FOR ANY LOSS OR INJURY ARISING OUT OF OR CAUSED BY YOUR USE OF A LOOKOUT

SERVICE OR THE CONTENT, DATA, RESULTS, INFORMATION OR OUTPUT THEREIN OR OBTAINED THEREFROM.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON

APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER, SO THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT

APPLY TO YOU.

8.2. Limitations of Liability. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW: (A) IN NO EVENT

WILL LOOKOUT OR ANY OTHER LOOKOUT ENTITY BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, PROFITS OR BUSINESS;

DAMAGE INVOLVING ANY DEVICE, EQUIPMENT, SYSTEM, CONTENT OR DATA (INCLUDING FOR LOSS, THEFT

POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND (B) WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, LOOKOUT’S AND THE OTHER

LOOKOUT ENTITIES’ TOTAL, COLLECTIVE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND

THE LOOKOUT SERVICES, IF ANY, SHALL NOT EXCEED IN AGGREGATE THE GREATER OF FIFTY U.S. DOLLARS

MONTHS PRECEDING THE FIRST SUCH CLAIM. MULTIPLE CLAIMS WILL NOT EXPAND THIS LIMITATION.

PARTY PRODUCTS AND (B) DISCLAIM ANY RESPONSIBILITY AND LIABILITY (INCLUDING FOR ANY DIRECT,

INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL AND OTHER DAMAGES OF ANY TYPE) ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THIRD

8.4. Other Terms. THE DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY IN THIS SECTION 8 APPLY IN NEW

JERSEY (U.S.) BUT MAY NOT APPLY IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY THOSE

JURISDICTION’S LAWS IN THE U.S. OR OTHERWISE. IF THOSE JURISDICTION’S LAWS ARE FOUND TO APPLY TO

THIS AGREEMENT, THIS SECTION 8 SHALL APPLY ONLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY SUCH

APPLICABLE LAW. WARRANTIES REQUIRED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, IF ANY, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE

SHORTEST PERIOD AND MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THIS

SECTION 9 WILL SURVIVE AND APPLY TO ANY CLAIMS, DAMAGES AND LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED

TORT, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE), AND EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF

ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

9. Indemnity. You agree to indemnify and hold Lookout and the Lookout Entities harmless from and against any

third-party claims, proceedings and demands and related losses, costs, damages, liabilities and expenses (including

defense costs and reasonable attorney’s fees) arising out of or related to: (a) your use or misuse of Lookout Service(s); (b)

your breach of any provision of this Agreement; or (c) your violation or alleged violation (including, in each case,

infringement, misappropriation or any other violation) of any law or third-party right (including without limitation any

intellectual property, privacy, publicity or other right). You further agree to defend Lookout and the Lookout Entities against

any such claims at our request, but we have right to assume the exclusive defense and control of such claims. You must

notify us of any such claims immediately and cooperate with Lookout in any defense. When you are defending a claim,

Lookout may participate in the defense through counsel of our own choosing and you must not make any admissions, take

positions adverse to Lookout or settle any claim without our prior written consent.

10. Arbitration and Class Action Waiver (U.S. Residents only). PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT

AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT. You and Lookout agree

that this Agreement affects interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and

enforcement of these arbitration provisions. This Section is intended to be interpreted broadly and governs any and all

disputes including but not limited to claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any Lookout Services, and/or any

aspect of the relationship between us, whether such claims are based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or

any other legal theory, arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement, or arose after the termination of this Agreement.

The only exceptions to this mandatory arbitration provision are described in the “Exceptions” subsection below. By agreeing

to this Agreement or using any Lookout Service, you agree to resolve any and all disputes with Lookout as follows:

10.1. Initial Dispute Resolution: Most disputes can be resolved without resorting to litigation. Before initiating an

arbitration, the parties agree to use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through

consultation with the Lookout support department. You can reach Lookout’s support department at support@lookout.com.

10.2. Binding Arbitration: If the parties do not reach an agreed-upon solution within a period of thirty (30) days from the

time informal dispute resolution is initiated under the provision above, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as

the sole means to resolve disputes. Specifically, all disputes (including but not limited to any claims arising out of or relating

to this Agreement, any Lookout Services, and/or any aspect of the relationship between us) shall be finally settled by binding

arbitration administered by JAMS in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Procedure Rules for claims that do

not exceed $250,000 and the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures for claims exceeding $250,000 in

effect at the time the arbitration is initiated. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have

exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or

formation of this Agreement (including the Privacy Policy) including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this

Agreement is void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, or the question of waiver by litigation conduct. The

arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator's

award shall be written and shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent

jurisdiction. To start an arbitration, you must do the following: (a) Write a Demand for Arbitration that includes a description

of the claim and the amount of damages you seek to recover (you may find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at

www.jamsadr.com); (b) Send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee, to JAMS, Two

Embarcadero Center, Suite 1500, San Francisco California 94111; and (c) Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to

Lookout at 3 Center Plaza, Boston, MA 02108, ATTN: General Counsel.

10.3. Class-Action Waiver. The parties further agree that the arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities

only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action

or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND LOOKOUT AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER

ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY

PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. The parties further agree that the JAMS Rules referenced

above shall exclude any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. If any court or arbitrator determines that

the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed

on a class basis, then the arbitration provisions set forth in this Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section shall be deemed

null and void in their entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.

10.4. Costs. To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, Lookout will pay the additional

cost. If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, Lookout will pay the fees invoiced by JAMS, including the filing

fees and arbitrator and hearing expenses they invoice. You are responsible for your own attorneys' fees unless the

arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise.

10.5. Location of Arbitration. If you are a resident of the United States, any arbitration hearings may take place in the

county where you reside at the time of filing or in another location mutually agreed by the parties. For residents outside the

United States, any arbitration shall be initiated in the State of California, United States of America, and you and Lookout

agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in San Francisco County, California in order to

compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award

entered by the arbitrator. If your claim is for $50,000 or less, either party may choose to attend a hearing telephonically,

video-graphically or in person. Hearings may also take place telephonically or video-graphically as provided for in the

applicable JAMS Rules.

10.6. Exceptions. Nothing anything to the contrary in this Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section: (a) either party

may bring enforcement actions, validity determinations or other claims arising from or relating to the infringement or validity

of intellectual property rights (excluding privacy or publicity rights) in any state, federal or international court or administrative

agency with jurisdiction over such claims; (b) either party may seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within

the scope of that court's jurisdiction; and (c) if you are a resident of the European Union and are dissatisfied with the manner

in which we have addressed your concerns about our privacy practices, you may address such claims as specified in our

Privacy Policy.

10.7. 30-Day Right to Opt Out: You have the right to opt out and not be bound by this Arbitration and Class Action Waiver

section by sending (from the email address registered to your Account) written notice of your decision to opt out to

legal@lookout.com with the subject line, "ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT" and your full legal

name. The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of your first use of the Lookout Services, otherwise you shall be bound

to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of this mandatory arbitration provision. If you opt out of these arbitration

provisions, Lookout also will not be bound by them.

10.8. Changes to This Section: If you have not opted-out of this Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section and Lookout

makes any future change to this section (other than a change to our notice address), you may reject any such change within

30 days of the change by sending us written notice (from the email address registered to your Account) to

legal@lookout.com with the subject line “OPT OUT OF CHANGES TO ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER” and

your full legal name. If you opt out of changes to this section, Lookout also will not be bound by those changes, and the

parties agree to arbitrate any dispute in accordance with the Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section in effect prior to

such rejected change. If a court or arbitrator decides that this paragraph is not enforceable or valid, then this paragraph

shall be severed from the rest of this Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section, and the court or arbitrator shall apply the

first Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section in existence after you began using the Lookout Services.

10.9. Additional Terms. The parties understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, they would have the

right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could

exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court. This Arbitration and

Class Action Waiver section shall survive any termination of your Account, the Lookout Services or this Agreement.

11. General.

11.1. Governing Law and Jurisdiction. This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action (whether in contract, tort or

statute) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of

this Agreement (including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to any representation or warranty

made in or in connection with this Agreement, or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement), shall be governed by and

enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New York U.S.A, including its statutes of limitations, without

regard to any borrowing statute that would result in the application of the statute of limitations of any other jurisdiction. All

claims arising out of or related to this Agreement or the Services must be litigated exclusively in the Federal or State courts

of New York, and the Parties expressly consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there. This Agreement shall not be

governed by the provisions of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and Uniform

Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA), or any similar federal laws or regulations enacted, to the extent allowed

by law shall not apply to this Agreement.

hereby incorporated into this Agreement. This Agreement (including those policies and guidelines) is the entire agreement

between you and Lookout relating to the Lookout Services or any other subject matter covered by this Agreement, and it

Services.

notice is provided through the Service user interface, is sent to the e-mail address associated with your account or otherwise;

or (ii) when you opt-in or otherwise expressly agree to the Changes or a version of this Agreement incorporating the

Changes, whichever comes first. If the Changes are not acceptable to you, your only recourse is to cease using the Lookout

Services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, changes to Section 10 (Arbitration and Class Action Waiver) shall be governed by

Section 10.8 (Changes to this Section).

11.4. Waivers. The failure of Lookout to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Agreement shall not constitute

a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the Agreement is found by an arbitrator court of competent jurisdiction

to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the arbitrator or court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions

as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Agreement remain in full force and effect.

11.5. Assignments. This Agreement (and any rights and licenses granted herein) may not be assigned by you, and any

assignment by you is void. Lookout may assign or delegate this Agreement without restriction, including to an affiliate or in

connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets. Any purported

assignment in violation of this Section 11.5 is null and void.

11.6. Notices. Any notice under this Agreement must be given in writing. You agree to receive all communications,

agreements, and notices that we provide in connection with any Lookout Service (“Communications”) electronically,

including by e-mail, text, in-app notifications, or by posting on the Lookout website or other parts of the Lookout Service.

You agree that all Communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such

communications be in writing. You further agree that we are not responsible for your failure to receive notices if you fail to

keep your Account information accurate and complete or if you filter our Communications. Our Communications to you will

inquiry as described in our Privacy Policy.

11.8. U.S. Government Use. The Lookout Services are commercial computer software. If you are an agency, department,

or other entity of the United States Government, the use, duplication, reproduction, release, modification, disclosure, or

transfer of the Lookout Services, or any related documentation of any kind, including technical data and manuals, is

restricted by the terms of this Agreement in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 12.212 for civilian purposes

and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement 227.7202 for military purposes. The Lookout Services were

developed fully at private expense. All other use is prohibited.

11.9. Export Restrictions. The Lookout Services are subject to export restrictions by the United States government and

import restrictions by certain foreign governments, and you agree to comply with all applicable export and import laws and

regulations in your access to or use of the Lookout Services. You shall not (and shall not allow any third-party to) remove

the United States or any foreign government, agency or authority. You represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in,

under the control of, or a national or resident of any such prohibited country or on any such prohibited party list and (ii) that

none of User Content or User Data is controlled under the US International Traffic in Arms Regulations. The Lookout

Services may not be used for the design or development of nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons or missile technology

without the prior permission of the United States government.

Distributors are not responsible for the Lookout Services or the content thereof. However, you acknowledge and agree that

Lookout Entities are intended beneficiaries of the Agreement and have the right to enforce the Agreement directly against

you. Except as specified in this Section, there are no third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement.

11.11. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable, then the provision

shall be performed and enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement

shall continue to remain in full force and effect.

accounts of users who may infringe or repeatedly infringe the copyrights of others in accordance with the DMCA.

the following (a “Notice”):



1. A description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed.

of perjury that you are the copyright owner or that you are authorized to act on the owner's behalf.



6. Your name, mailing address, telephone number, and email address.

Company’s Designated Agent for Notice of claims of copyright infringement can be reached as follows:



Lookout, Inc.

Attn: Copyright Agent

3 Center Plaza, Suite 330

Boston, MA 02108

Email: legal@lookout.com, ATTN: COPYRIGHT AGENT.



Please note that you may be liable for damages, including court costs and attorneys’ fees, if you misrepresent that content

uploaded by a Lookout Services user is infringing your copyright.



Upon receiving a proper Notice, Company will remove or disable access to the allegedly infringing material and notify the

6. Your physical or electronic signature.

Please note that if you misrepresent that the disabled or removed content was removed by mistake or misidentification, you

may be liable for damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees.



C. Repeat Infringer Policy



Company may withdraw all rights and privileges relating to the Lookout Services from any user who is deemed to be a

repeat infringer. This determination will be based on the number of “strikes” against the user. A “strike” is counted against

a user each time there is either: (i) an adjudication by a court, arbitrator or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction that the

user has engaged in copyright infringement of any kind in relation to the Lookout Services; or (ii) Company has actual

knowledge, regardless of any such adjudication, that the user has engaged in any such copyright infringement.



Each adjudication or instance of knowledge counts as a separate strike. If an adjudication or instance of knowledge pertains

to multiple instances of copyright infringement, it can count as multiple strikes. Company has adopted a “three strikes and

you’re out” policy under which a user who accumulates three strikes is considered a repeat infringer and may be subject to

account termination.
