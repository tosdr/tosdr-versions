Cookies
=======

Cookies help to make the website work properly and securely. Cookies also enable us to better inform you, e.g. about relevant products and services. Did you know that there are different types of cookies? And do you know what they are used for? Allow us to explain. You can also read more about other technologies, such as Local Storage, on this page.

What are cookies?
-----------------

Cookies are small text files that are collected by your browser and temporarily stored on your computer (more precisely, in your browser directory). They can neither access the data on your hard drive nor cause any damage there. A cookie is primarily used to store information about a user during or after their visit within a website. This information is used, for example, to provide us, as the operator of the website, with statistical information about the use of the website, or to ensure the security of the website, for example by recognising requests from bots.

Thanks to cookies, you don't have to enter the same information every time you visit the website, for example. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings in your browser, however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use all features of this website.

Why does Rabobank place cookies?
--------------------------------

Only absolutely necessary (often also: essential or technically necessary) cookies and, where applicable, local storage elements are currently used on our website. Without these, the operation, the guarantee of security and the use of the functionalities of the website are not possible. If you deactivate necessary cookies, the functionality of the website will therefore be impaired.

Cookies
-------

### BIGipServer

Retention period: until you close the browser or Rabo App.

We use these cookies to distribute traffic across Rabobank's various computer systems and there is no collection of personal data in the process.

### RABO\_Analytics

Retention period: 6 months

With this cookie we analyze processes or sales that start on our website. For example, the percentage of savings account purchases on our website that are successful, or what percentage still needs an advisor during the purchase.

### RABO\_UT

Retention period: 6 months

With this cookie we distinguish between visitors and customers. If you are a customer and you log in, we use this cookie to show you the correct content, for example your own accounts in the Rabo App.

### RABOBANK\_OPTINOUT and RABO\_PSL

Retention period: 6 months - reset with each request

We use this cookie to store the choice of which cookie preference you want to apply. This cookie setting is stored at profile level without personal data collection. Resetting the retention period prevents you from seeing the cookie banner very frequently.

### Piano Analytics

Retention period: 13 months

This cookie is used for analysing client behaviour on our website. This tool enables us to get a better understanding on how clients are using our digital platforms.

\_pcid: This is the visitor ID that allows us to aggregate the data based on an anonymous visitor ID. Usually this is tied to the same browser. \_pctx: Used as a means of storage for persistent variables across the pages visited by the user. This means that we can persist various variables for a longer period time and integrate them in requests that follow up after the initial page view. This is convenient to make certain requests richer. pa\_privacy and \_pprv: Contains the consent

### Utag and utag\_main

Retention period: 1 year.

This cookie is used by our tag management system Tealium. This enables us to use functionalities from partners, such as visitor statistics and feedback functionalities. Your web address is automatically made unrecognizable. No traceable personal data is therefore stored.

A cookie checker may also show TIQCDN. That is not a cookie. TIQCDN is Tealium's computer that calls the tag manager.

### ak\_bmsc & bm\_sv

These cookies are used to enable Akamai to load the website as quickly as possible and to detect bots.

Storage limit: Session. Recipient: Rabobank

Local storage
-------------

In addition to cookies, there are also so-called local storage elements (also called "local data" and "local memory"). In this case, data is stored locally in the cache of your browser, which continues to exist and can be read even after you close the browser window or exit the programme - as long as you do not delete the cache. Third parties cannot access the data stored in the local storage. They are not passed on to third parties and are not used for advertising purposes.
