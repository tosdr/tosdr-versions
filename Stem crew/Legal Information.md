**PRIVACY NOTICE**

Last updated 14 October 2023.

Thank you for choosing to be part of our community at the 1851 Trust  (“Charity”, “we”, “us”, “our”). We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy. If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy notice, or our practices with regards to your personal information, please get in touch by email at [enquiries@1851trust.org.uk](mailto:enquiries@1851trust.org.uk).

When you visit our website [www.stemcrew.org](http://www.stemcrew.org/) (the “Website) and more generally, use any of our services (the “Services”, which include the Website), we appreciate that you are trusting us with your personal information. We take your privacy very seriously. In this privacy notice, we seek to explain to you in the clearest way possible what information we collect, how we use it and what rights you have in relation to it. We hope you take some time to read through it carefully, as it is important. If there are any terms in this privacy notice that you do not agree with, please discontinue use of our Services immediately.

This privacy notice applies to all information collected through our Services (which, as described above, includes our Website), as well as any related services, sales, marketing, or events.

Please read this privacy notice carefully as it will help you understand what we do with the information that we collect.

WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?

**Personal information you disclose to us**

We collect personal information that you provide to us. We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you register on the Services, express an interest in obtaining information about us or our products and Services, when you participate in activities on the Services or otherwise when you contact us. The personal information that we collect depends on the context of your interactions with us and the Services, the choices you make and the products and features you use.

The personal information we collect may include the following:

**Personal information provided by you.** We collect names; phone numbers; email addresses; mailing addresses; job titles; contact preferences; contact or authentication data;  and other similar information.

All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete, and accurate, and you must notify us of any changes to such personal information.

**Information automatically collected**

Some information — such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or browser and device characteristics — is collected automatically when you visit our Services. We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the Services. This information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use our Services and other technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our Services, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.

Like many businesses, we also collect information through cookies and similar technologies. You can find out more about this in our [Cookie Policy](http://www.stemcrew.org/cookie-policy/).

The information we collect includes:

**Log and Usage Data.** Log and usage data is service-related, diagnostic, usage, and performance information our servers automatically collect when you access or use our Services and which we record in log files. Depending on how you interact with us, this log data may include your IP address, device information, browser type and settings and information about your activity in the Services (such as the date/time stamps associated with your usage, pages and files viewed, searches and other actions you take such as which features you use), device event information (such as system activity, error reports (sometimes called ‘crash dumps’) and hardware settings).

**Device Data.** We collect device data such as information about your computer, phone, tablet, or other device you use to access the Services. Depending on the device used, this device data may include information such as your IP address (or proxy server), device and application identification numbers, location, browser type, hardware model Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, operating system, and system configuration information.

**Location Data.** We collect location data such as information about your device’s location, which can be either precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access the Services. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location setting on your device. Note however, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the Services.

**Student’s personal information disclosed to us**

When a young person attends one of our events or school sessions, we collect data including their gender, year group and school on a feedback form. Once this feedback form has been analysed, the personal data is deleted. No names or identifying characteristics are collected during this process.

Where a school provides disability and accessibility information for a group of children, this is recorded against their school booking however no identifying information is collected (i.e. name of the child requiring additional support) as this responsibility sits with the school teachers.

When a group of students or a young person is taking part in our active programmes e.g. sailing, they are required to complete an additional medical and parental consent form which is supplied by our third-party activity suppliers. These forms are passed to the third-party supplier via the 1851 Trust and held securely in accordance with the supplier’s privacy notice. The 1851 Trust does not hold any copy of this information. For information on the suppliers we use, please contact [enquiries@1851trust.org.uk](mailto:enquiries@1851trust.org.uk).

At our events and activities, we may collect quotes and photographs of young people for whom we have received consent to do so. This consent will have been provided by the parent or guardian to the school or organisation they visit us with. The quotes and photographs may be used by us to promote our programmes and for marketing and fundraising purposes. If any parent or young person wishes to withdraw their consent for images to be used in our future materials after their activity, they may do so by emailing [enquiries@1851trust.org.uk](mailto:enquiries@1851trust.org.uk).

We are committed to safeguarding young people in accordance with our Safeguarding Policy and maintain current DBS clearances and safeguarding training for all 1851 Trust staff.

**DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?**

We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.

We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information. Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our [Cookie Policy](http://www.stemcrew.org/cookie-policy/).

**IS YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED INTERNATIONALLY?**     

We may transfer, store, and process your information in countries other than your own.

Some of the servers we use are in the United States.  We have implemented measures to protect your personal information, including by using the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between our group companies and between us and our third-party providers. These clauses require all recipients to protect all personal information that they process originating from the EEA or UK in accordance with European data protection laws and regulations. Our Standard Contractual Clauses can be provided upon request. We have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third-party service providers and partners and further details can be provided upon request.

**HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?**

We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.

We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than twenty-four (24) months past the start of any idle period of the user’s account.

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

**HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?**

We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organisational and technical security measures.

We have implemented appropriate technical and organisational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.

**WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?**

Under data protection law, you have rights we need to make you aware of. These are:

**Your right of access**

You have the right to ask us for copies of the personal information we hold about you at any time.

**Your right to rectification**

You have the right to ask us to rectify any information we hold about you that you think is inaccurate. You also have the right to ask us to complete information you think is incomplete.

**Your right to erasure**

You have the right to ask us to erase your personal information from all our systems.

**Your right to restriction of processing**

You have the right to ask us to restrict the ways in which we process your information.

**Your right to object to processing**

You have the right to object to processing if we are doing so in our legitimate interests.

**Your right to data portability**

This only applies to information you have given to us. You have the right to ask that we transfer the information you gave us from one entity to another or give it to you directly. The right only applies if we are processing information based on your consent or under, or in talks about entering a contract and our processing is automated.

To make a request under any of these rights, please contact us by email at [enquiries@1851trust.org.uk](mailto:enquiries@1851trust.org.uk). We will consider any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note however that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

If you are a resident in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find their contact details here: [http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index\_en.htm](http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm).

If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, please contact us by email at [enquiries@1851trust.org.uk](mailto:enquiries@1851trust.org.uk) or write to us at Number One, The Parade, Cowes, PO13 7QJ.

**Account Information**

If you would at any time like to review or change the information we have for you, change any information in any account you might have with us, or terminate your account, please contact us by email at [enquiries@1851trust.org.uk](mailto:enquiries@1851trust.org.uk).

Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active databases. However, we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our Terms and Conditions and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.

**Cookies and similar technologies:** Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Services. To opt-out of interest-based advertising by advertisers on our Services visit [http://www.aboutads.info/choices/](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/). For further information, please see our [Cookie Policy](http://www.stemcrew.org/cookie-policy/).

**Opting out of email marketing:** You can unsubscribe from our marketing email list at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send or by contacting us by email <insert mailto: hyperlink>. You will then be removed from the marketing email list — however, we may still communicate with you, for example to send you service-related emails that are necessary for the administration and use of your account, to respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.

**CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES**

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.

**DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?**     

Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.

We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated “Revised” date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes to this privacy notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this privacy notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.

**HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?**     

If you have questions or comments about this notice, you may contact us at [enquiries@1851trust.org.uk](mailto:enquiries@1851trust.org.uk) or by post at Number One, The Parade, Cowes, PO13 7QJ.
